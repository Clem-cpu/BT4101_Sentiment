11/3/23,I'm afraid we have some bad news,"USDC has lost it's peg, this could be one of those black swan events that could collapse not only USDC, but crypto as a whole, hopefully it's going to go back up, if it doesn't...we are in for a rough ride, most of you will say ""yeah give me cheap btc"" the problem is, you won't even buy it no matter how low it's going to go lol

&#x200B;

USDC dropped as low as 0.91$ and now it's hovering around 0.93$, hopefully it's just a flash drop, because if USDC will drop...the only alternative USDT is not convenient at all, I'd rather hold no stable coins than hold USDT ngl

For crypto's sake we should all hope this goes back to 1$ or else...summer is going to be cold af

It really sucks for us, USDC holders who thought this is a bit safer than USDT, if it collapses first then sayonara.

What do you guys think will happen next? Doesn't look good :D

thanks to [**LongjumpingMiddle850**](https://www.reddit.com/user/LongjumpingMiddle850/) we just realised DAI lost the peg too"
11/3/23,Coinbase just suspended selling USD Coin. Massive selloff drains Curve pool.,"At the time of writing this, Curve 3pool USDT reserve is completely drained as a result of massive USDC selloff:

Only a few hours ago, the liquidity was pretty balanced, though you could see the trend starting:

Coinbase, who has a big stake in Circle (issuer) and has been promoting it for a long time with zero fees, just tweeted this:

This means no one can sell their coin over the weekend at least. They have the nerve to act like banks being closed on the weekends is a new thing. Obviously Coinbase is afraid of the massive selloff that has already started as result of Silicon Valley Bank and Silvergate Bank going down. Circle held a massive cash reserve in both and failed to withdraw at least a portion of it from SVB:

https://preview.redd.it/wmq6yyt3i1na1.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1c2cffea90b6213f0008dda489d744a145203225

At the time of writing this, both DAI and USD Coin have depegged. If you have liquidity pools with it, expect people to drain your other token and leave you with 100% USDC in your pool. The depegging will get worse since all the liquidity is being drained. Though it is not the first time its depegged, in the middle of all the banks going down, it seems more serious than before. Stay safe and may the market survive this weekend!"
10/3/23,BlockFi holds $227 million in Silicon Valley Bank... When will the show end!?,"According to a recent bankruptcy filing, BlockFi holds $227 million in Silicon Valley Bank. However, the bankruptcy trustee cautioned the company on Monday that these funds are not FDIC insured because they are invested in a money market mutual fund. This could pose a problem for BlockFi in terms of complying with bankruptcy laws.

  
**Silicon Valley Bank** was the 2nd largest bank failure in US history, with 209$ Billion in assets at the time of failure (apparently). Only Washington Mutual bank failure was bigger...

Good luck everyone, hope this doesn't blow the entire financial system...  


Btw, Jim Cramer said a month ago **Silicon Valley Bank** was a buy at 320$.  
He did the same with Bear Sterns in 2008.  
This man is definitely a criminal on live television... Glad the SEC and every law enforcement is still looking away from the real criminals in this world..."
11/3/23,Binance CEO: Exchange Has ‘No Exposure to Silicon Valley Bank’,
11/3/23,Last chance to buy USDC under $1.00 - we may never see these prices again,"USDC depegged on Friday due to Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) concerning circle and the USDC cash reserves it held in Silicon Valley Bank.

USDC dropped to a low of $0.87 on some exchanges, brave investors confident in USDC and Circle bought the dip of a stable coin that had depegged hoping to gain and easy 13% profit.

&#x200B;

After Circle announced that it would cover any funds lost with corporate reserves the peg of USDC started going back up as more people bought.

USDC is currently at $0.98 so you still have a chance to make a 2% in profit (not financial advice)

# 🤷

Edit: It's now at $0.97 (again not financial advice)

Edit-2: It's now at $0.9664 (abandon all hope)

Edit-3: shit it fell to $0.956 (maybe this wasn't the best idea)

Edit-4: Two consecutive candles at $0.954 (seems we found a new support level, all TA points towards an upward trajectory from here)"
11/3/23,Diversify your portfolio to reduce your risk profile!,"Hey crypto degens, with all the recent news about SVB, USDC and the general negative attitude of the SEC / US govt on crypto its really is tough out there. 

That's why it's so important to diversify your portfolio to reduce your risk profile as much as possible in times like this. 

Here's how I'm managing my portfolio this year and its really helped with my mental health. 


- 13% - FTX (FTT)
- 13% - Anchor protocol 
- 13% - Celsius (CEL)
- 13% - BlockFi
- 13% - equity stake in The Block
- 13% - Greyscale's BTC
- 10% - In a stablecoin like TUSD
- 13% - in Silicon Valley Bank. 

Using this strategy has really helped my mental health, as I no longer have any crypto. The only bag I'm holding now is Dee's nuts. 

Stay safe out there crypto degens. Not your keys, not your crypto."
10/3/23,What even is a safe stablecoin at this point?,"**USDC** printed a -1% candle an hour ago. It's possibly in trouble because because of it's cash reserves being held by silvergate & SVB.

**USDT** has been trading slightly above the peg today, probably because people are shifting to it from USDC. The crypto community in general is on the fence about USDT and rightly so, since only about half the tether is backed by USD, the rest is bonds, metals & other investments.

**BUSD** isn't safe with ongoing lawsuits & investigations into binance.

**DAI**: it's decentralised, but only backed by ETH, if ETH or the crypto market crashes, DAI could become under collateralised.

Rest of the stables have such low trading volumes that it won't take much to collapse them.

What are your thoughts, which stable are you guys holding while waiting for your buy targets?

## **EDIT**: 
What we feared has happened.

Silvergate & Silicon Valley Bank contagion is spreading.

**Circle had a substantial amount of it's funds (~3 billion $) with SVB.** 

[USDC is down to 90 cents](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/usd-coin)

**DAI**, a decentralised coin which was supposed to backed by Ethereum. But it was also heavily backed by USDC, making it not so ""decentralised"". 
[DAI is also down to 90 cents](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dai)

**BUSD** also showing weakness. [It's down to 99 cents.](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/binance-usd)

[TUSD also down to 99 cents.](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/true-usd) 


The so called ""decentralised"" stablecoins that are collapsing:

[MIM down to 92 cents](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/magic-internet-money)

[LUSD down to 98 cents](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/liquity-usd)

[FRAX down to 92 cents](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/frax)

There's a lot more stables that are collapsing that I haven't mentioned here.
Here's a complete list of stablecoins filtered on coingecko:

https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/stablecoins

Nothing is looking good as of now. Only USDT is holding it's peg, but considering that tether only holds about half it's funds in USD fiat & the rest is in bonds, metals & investments, I won't trust it for too long.
Even if it survives it's better to be safe than sorry.
Who knows if it can survive a bank run.

**Get out of stables, keep your funds safe.**"
11/3/23,"Are you not fully sure what's happening? Like many, you may be wondering why all these banks are failing, and why it affects crypto. I broke down the explanation of the causes, and the effect on crypto. Bonus: ""explain like I'm 5"" at the bottom.","*edit: made a mistake in the title, and had to remake the whole post.* 

It's a side effect of Fed raising the rates too quickly, along with institutions who faced some Covid crisis vulnerabilities in the last 2 years.

It will have some short term effect on the crypto market, but as we've seen last year, may not necessarily last that long for crypto.

&#x200B;

# Why are interest rates becoming a problems for banks?

It's really banks like SVB who ran into problems with Covid that are the first ones to run into this problem.

SVB was facing the issue of recent years of low interest rates, exacerbated by Covid, which makes it tough for banks.

That's how they make money.

They have to look at ways to invest their clients funds. And from lack of better options, they had to look at more long term investments.

And that's where it came back to bite them in the ass.

Feds have increased interest rates way too fast, to try to tackle inflation....which was caused mainly by their money printers, along with the side effects of the Covid crisis.

# 

# What happens when interest rates rise too fast?

Short term, it means it increases the rates for everything  (loans, bond rates, mortgage rates, etc..}

So that's good news for banks right?

Not for banks like SVB who don't have enough of the short term investments, and are more heavily invested in long term investments.

The rates may have increased short term, like for bons, but long term bonds are lower now. It's called an inverted yield curve. When long term bonds give you a lower yield than short term bonds, when normally it should be the opposite.

Banks like SVB have 2 problems:

They have the shittier rates of return, and they are tied up in long term investments that they are stuck with for years before it reaches maturity. They can off course sell it at any time, but not for what they've put in. Those bonds have lower demand, so they have to sell them at a loss. So to have cash and provide liquidity, they have to lose money.

And that's when they start seeing red.

When people realize those banks may not have enough money, it could start a bank run.

&#x200B;

# Silvergate

Silvergate ran into that very same problem. But on top of that, it also had too many people from crypto pulling out their cash from the crypto market.

A big chunk of Silvergate are crypto depositor.

In 2022, there were more people pulling out cash than putting it in, due to the crypto bear market.

And they pulled out by the hundreds of millions.

&#x200B;

# How does this affect crypto?

Some of these banks like Silvergate, were heavily tied in crypto, and were banks used for DeFi. And as many of these things typically go, there could be more contagion. It starts affecting everything.

More importantly for us in crypto, its one of the depositors for exchanges like Coinbase and Gemini.

When you bought crypto on Coinbase, one of the bank they used to deposit that money was Silvergate. Same when you cash out.

But JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Signature Bank, and others, are still among the banks they still use as their FBO accounts to get those funds and liquidity.

The other issue is the people panicking about USDC. Luckily, USDC is not an alog stablecoin like Luna.

The main issue realy lies ultimately on the banking side.

And you can make the case that this actually further highlights the problems of banking, and the need for blockchain, decentralzation, and crypto.

The big flaws here are exposed in the centralized banking system.

It relies too heavily on trust.

Trusting a bank, and trusting that not too many people will pull their cash at the same time.

Because the hard truth is in the end, banks don't actually have your money.

In crypto, your funds are always gonna be on the blockchain whenever you need them. It's absolute money, with absolute ownership, always absolutely present.

But right now, crypto still heavily tied to centralization and traditional market. The decentralized side of finance isn't big enough yet.

Is this something big and long term for crypto?

It will likely have further short term side affects. But when it comes to the crypto market, I wouldn't bet on long term effect. Coinbase, Gemini, and many other users of these banks, already have alternative. Many of the funds were also FDIC insured FBOs. I know Coinbase's fund should be mostly FDIC insured.

And even USDC which seems to be what's most affected, isn't an algo stablecoin like Luna, and has a better chance at getting repegged, along with more likely having a more solid backing.

And ultimately, we got the advantage of already have seen this play out. We've had a combo of Luna collapsing, one of the main exchanges (FTX) also collapse in its own scam, and other financial companies in crypto like Voyager also tank.  And we've seen that despite the apocalyptic and Lehman brothers look alike, the effect remained short term, and crypto managed to bounce right back fairly quickly.

&#x200B;

# tl;dr: Explain to me like I'm 5.

\-Remember Covid and Fed printers? That caused a lot of inflation, the cost of goods rising.

\-Fed in response raised rates to tackle it, but maybe a little too high too quickly.

\-Those rates rising, plus the market expecting a recession, caused short term bonds to be worth more, but long term bonds to drop in value.

\-Banks like SVB who simply didn't have any better options at the time (mainly because of Covid), were too heavily invested in long term bonds.

\-Those banks portfolio lost value, and couldn't give competitive returns, customers pulled out.

\-As people pulled out, they had to sell those bonds to be able to pay money to those customers, but at a loss.

\-It created a vicious cycle, of lost value, and even more customers wanting to pull out. And eventually a bank run as the bank was failing.

\-One of those banks (Silvergate) was one of the money provider for Coinbase, Gemini, and others in crypto. That bank lost value because of the interest rates issues, and because of too many crypto bros pulling out their money during the bear market. It eventually failed. That created a ripple effect of fear on crypto (especially on USDC).

\-Some good news: USDC isn't an algo coin like Luna. We've already seen financial companies for crypto collapse last year, while seeing stablecoins completely collapse, along with major exchange collapse, in the same time frame. And crypto was still able to bounce back quickly. Coinbase, Gemini, etc... have already found other banks elsewhere. There could be some potential government bailouts. These banks, and some of those crypto funds like Coinbase's were FDIC insured."
11/3/23,One turned $2.03 million into $0.05 and the other one turned $1.5 into $2.03 million,"Someone got rekt hard due this USDC panic. Kyberswap helped a user to swap $2.03M for $0.05. In the midst of the depeg panic, a user used Kyberswap to swap a $2.03M stake in the protocol's 3pool curve pool (representing a stake in USDC/USDT/DAI) for 0.05 USDT. Instead of channeling and swapping through Curve, Kyberswap channeled Uniswap v2 to the pool, where there was only a few $ liquidity against 3pool CRV LP tokens, which led to a monstrous deal: $2.03M -> $0.05 USDT.

11/3/23,Satoshi didn’t create BTC for us to worry about the 10-year bond rate or interest rates in general.,"SVB apparently had a shit ton of 10-year bonds.  Why you would want to tie your funds up for such little return I cannot understand but if I were to guess I’d guess it’s for *Stability*

That’s pretty laughable now - I mean to laugh because it’s better than being upset 

Truly, the regulators and Circle have a good relationship.  That relationship is what led to USDC being collaterized in commercial paper, investments in the “traditional” banking systems.

Satoshi created BTC because the traditional banking system is fraudulent and not to be trusted.

I’ve always been a fan of Circle/USDC and part of that was because they were compliant.  I know they have powerful friends and that’s attractive.

In the end though, Hal Finney knew better 14 years ago and he knew this type of thing would happen over and over and over again.  That’s how this goes I guess.  Bank runs are not a new thing."
11/3/23,"If you're freaking out today, you might want to take a look at these comments in the daily almost exactly 3 years ago. And if you're not freaking out, read them anyway. They're pure gold","I've shared these comments before but with the 3 year anniversary coming up and with recent news events and so-called ""stable"" coins losing their peg, I feel like now would be a good time to look through a previous ""catastrophe"" to get some perspective.

On [12 March 2020](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/fh77ef/daily_discussion_march_12_2020_gmt0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb), as covid was spreading all over the world, people were also panicking as the Bitcoin price plunged approximately *40% from $8000 to $4,800 in a single day*. A global pandemic was unprecedented, and to many it felt like this could be ""the end of crypto"" (spoiler, it wasn't).

So check out some of the highlights from the daily that day. It sounds like something you'd find in the Buttcoin sub:

>I've been in crypto 4 years and have never lost so much money in a single day before. Funnily enough, I feel nothing.

>HOLY FUCKING SHIT! 5.8K?!! REALLY??!

>Down 33% last 24 hours. Down 59% last week. Big oof.

>This is the end for Bitcoin in my opinion.

>Just sell already. Cryptocurrency is the most obvious ponzi scheme in the world. Literally, bitconnect had a huge marketcap in the past. It's okay to admit you fell for an obvious ponzi scam.

>Been in crypto since q1 2013 and this is the worst single day crash i have seen

>Might buy some BTC at $100

>Huh. What the hell? From 8000 to 4700 in 28 hours?

>At this rate you'll be able to buy 50$ btc in a week

>Wow eth hit 90 already. Going to get pretty bad. We may see 50 dollar eth

>Crypto is over. All shares are collapsing and soon fiat will hyper inflate. This is the end.

>the real joke here is that we thought this would reach ATH this year

(This is a good one because we actually did go on to make a new ATH later that year.)

>I can't believe some of you are buying back in already. That was just the start of the new bear market. The Fed pumped 1.5 TRILLION dollars into the stock market yesterday and it barely did a thing. We are going DOWN big time from here as soon as another bad enough Corona headline hits

>I will buy when BTC hits 1000$.(in a few days)

>Good to see that people are realising that bitcoin is actually worthless and has no value

>can someone please fucking explain to me why anyone should keep holding bitcoin ? it has proven to be an utter failure at the one thing it was thought to be useful for.... sToRE oF vAluE. myth debunked. it is an utterly useless piece of trash. the only thing that would make sense is for this shit to go down to zero and fucking spare us all.

But some users were able to look past the fear and see the bigger picture:

>Unpopular opinion: Bitcoin is still a digital gold and a hedge against the recession. The current decline is the future ""low base effect"" being formed. When a rise of Bitcoin in a sea of red will hit the news at the right time, stocks money and money printed to soften the recession will flow into it leading to The Moon.

When times are bullish we tend to get overexcited (when 100k?) And when times are bearish we tend to fear the worst (see above).

I don't know what's going to happen next. You don't know what's going to happen next. But as long as you have your crypto in self custody and it's not a centralised and/or shit coin, sit back, grab some popcorn and enjoy the drama. Think of it as something to tell the grandkids one day"

It's a bittersweet accomplishment, yesterday the ETH/USDC pool was at $390K and we were so close to beating them at their all time high, but due to the fall out surrounding Circle and USDC the liquidity from the pool has been getting drained and has dropped $20K in the last day.

I was told for the last few years that when the fiat banking system faces severe stress, like what is happening right now, Bitcoin is going to save the day and be the safe haven.

So my question is, why haven’t we pumped? This seems like the closest we’ve been to the reason Bitcoin was created in the first place, shouldn’t people be starting to convert their money to Bitcoin? Or is it going to be a slow process?

Seems like the options are either people move over to crypto or QE starts, both of which seems extremely bullish for us."

I have USDT on CEX and I need to pay a fee to withdraw it to an ERC-20 token in a wallet, then exchange USDT to DAI, which requires ETH, so I need to also withdraw ETH, and then and only then I can buy MOONs. The gas costs and withdrawal fees amounted to $12 on a $380 transaction. This is quite crazy.

In comparison, exchanging a fiat currency requires me to a) go to an exchange or b) just Revolut it (or similar) - that's the currency comparison. For jnvestments, I just need a brokerage account (same difficulty as CEX acc) and just add money and buy, usually commission free.

11/3/23,"From January To March, The Crypto Fear And Greed Index Swings From 25 To 62 And Then Back To 33. Where Are We Heading Now?","After some turbulent months of ups and downs the crypto fear and greed index have made some big swings. In this post the crypto fear and greed index will be analyzed for 2023.

**For the people that are not familiar with the crypto fear and greed index:**

The fear and greed index is a metric that measures the (emotional) sentiment of the market. The score goes from 0 to 100. A score closer to zero means that the market is in extreme fear and a score closer to hundred indicates that the market is in extreme greed. The score is determined by the following aspects: Volatility, Market Momentum/Volume, Social Media, Surveys, Dominance and Trends.

**The crypto fear and greed index right now:**

&#x200B;

[The crypto fear and greed index is at 33 on the 11th of March 2023](https://preview.redd.it/cqbqm7v7n5na1.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=768ec240fdcb16b2724d01d8241fbeac623c684d)

Today on the 11th of March we hit a score of 33, which indicates that the market sentiment is in fear. This has all to do with the recent turmoil in the market.

**The crypto fear and greed index in the past month:**

&#x200B;

[The crypto fear and greed index in the past month](https://preview.redd.it/6ue7pohsn5na1.png?width=1132&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6af7fd75ec9e663a4ab6d984dfad4e83ccf2a119)

In the past month we had hit a score of 62 on February the 16th. From that day the score has steadily declining until March the 8th. The days after the 8th of March the score took a plunge due to the banking problems and the effects on USDC and other stablecoins. Also the SEC actions took a role in the current market sentiment. 

&#x200B;

**The crypto fear and greed index in the past 3 months:**

&#x200B;

In this graph we can see that on January the 11th we started an uptrend with the small uprise in crypto. The score on that day was 26. After that day there was a steady increase in the crypto fear and greed score until the 8th of March. Next the plunge started mentioned in the previous graph.

**What to expect now?**

In my opinion it all depends on the effect on the current banking crisis. The real consequences for the failing of Silvergate and SVB is still unknown. Also it will be interesting to see if more banks are in trouble. In the upcoming weeks we will know more for sure. 

Also we have to wait on what the SEC will do with all their plans and regulations in the crypto industry.

Maybe 80% of the reader count we have now joined back then.                            

https://imgur.com/a/0QGz7lh                 

I remember the day when tether lost its peg nearly 5 years ago. They still recovered... This is not financial advice, but whether or not we can and will see USDC recover, well that's a different story. I sincerely hope they do recover because they seems to have a more ""legit"" business story and background than tether.            

EDIT：Coinbase has suspended USDC converatibility to USD: https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1634399032767307776?s=46&t=ndTL4Q7evm-vuNA-KeGTtQ             

It amazes me how many people have shown up in this thread that just say ""oH bUt UsT wAs A sTaBlEcOiN aNd It WeNt To ZeRo."" without understanding backing by assets. USDC is -supposedly- pegged 1 to 1 on the USD. Tether is backed by a mix of cash reserves (at 70% of market cap) and paper investments.

EDIT 2: Binance has temporarily stopped USDC to BUSD auto-conversions for the time being - https://twitter.com/binance/status/1634361554543030273?s=46                    

#NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE:              
My own opinion is that this might be resolved in a week or two (DO NOT TRADE BASED ON THIS ADVICE). Somehow this reminds me of the ""bitcoin inflation bug"" early on in like 2010 that required coordination from multiple parties to create a rollback to a safer block state and a patch to fix: https://decrypt.co/39750/184-billion-bitcoin-anonymous-creator              

EDIT 3: /u/me-you-and-nothing has pointed out that in the beginning there were times USDC broke its peg in a positive trend (greater than 1 USD per USDC) if you go far enough back on its chart on Coingecko / CMC - https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/usd-coin"

I believe there will be four ways this will end, I would love to hear you theories and thoughts on what I’m about to say, with further a do, let’s begin. 

#FIRST OUTCOME

Usdc continues being depegged, and all the 61 billion in the mc gets flushed out, and the market crashes.

And possibly the biggest winter we’ve ever seen. 

#SECOND OUTCOME

Usdc gets repegged and we all sleep fine tonight, and hopefully soon. And we forget about this whole situation within months. 

#THIRD SITUATION 

All the 61 billion mc in Usdc gets dumped in BTC, ETH, and Alts. Pumping the entire market while we see Usdc get pushed under the rug

#FOURTH OUTCOME

Usdc stays depegged and usdt soaks up all that juicy 61 billion mc and continues to become and unstoppable force (at least for now). 

These are the outcomes I can think of, I will edit this post and add more outcomes the comments say. 

So comment your outcomes you think is a possibility and I’ll add them here: 




#COMMUNITY OUTCOMES:



#OUTCOME 1:

USDC is probably going to dump hard like BUSD did. Traders don't stick around for a depeg because it gets too confusing doing trades, it's only benefit is arbitrage.

-3utt5lutt


#OUTCOME 2:

Usdc and tether both depeg, while the stock market also crashes, and banks fail left and right.

Enter central bank digital currency to save the day!

-Lorein6

#OUTCOME 3

If USDC doesn't recover the Depeg, stablecoins will be subject to a very hard regulation and scrutiny. Moreover people will loose trust in stablecoins.

This stress test and reaction it is necessary, however.

Billions dollar worth assed should be backed by a very solid structure.

11/3/23,Remember the very reason crypto exists in the first place when these financial giants are going under,"With these banks dropping like flys and fear spreading through all financial markets recently, keep on mind crypto solves these problems.

The corrupt lawmakers are trying to continue to spread lies that crypto is to blame for these financial institutions going under since they have 1-2% exposure to this industry.

Don’t believe them.  The reason banks fail to begin with is because they do not have collateral to back customer assets 1:1, so when a bank run happens they are illiquid.  When you give banks your money they immediately lend it out, so they no longer have your money, just IOUs.  Same thing when you borrow from a bank.  They are just giving you fake money to use that they do not actually have to lend.

With crypto you own your own coins on the blockchain if you self custody.  There is no risk for this to happen, even if exchanges fail.

Is it a coincidence, that back in 2008 when these “to big to fail” banks all failed, and the government bailed them out causing a further devaluation of the dollar and higher debt was when bitcoin was created shortly after?

11/3/23,Let's Run the Numbers on DAI - Depegging and Collateral,"With USDC and Circle exposure to SVB, I decided earlier today to move my stablecoin positions into DAI. Eight hours later, I kind of wish I had chosen something else, but I think it is worth looking into what happens in different SVB insolvency scenarios and the knock-on effects, particularly to DAI. I wrote out portions of this in a comment in another thread but I think looking at the math is worthwhile.

First off, let's look at how much exposure Circle has to SVB, and therefore how much is at risk: with $3.3B in SVB, against \~41B USDC in circulation. As a percentage, 8% of USDC collateral is at risk.

Next, let's talk about what happens if Circle experiences a liquidity crunch and must dispose of assets on their balance sheet. They likely take a small haircut on the short term bonds, maybe 1-2%. Theoretically these assets are very liquid, but I suppose if they cannot quickly dispose of them there could be a run-on-the-bank situation. Expect US Government conservatorship in that case and a long time for redemptions to happen. Otherwise we can say that about another 2% of the USDC collateral is at risk.

If SVB is completely insolvent with ABSOLUTELY 0 ASSETs - in other words, creditors get nothing - that means that the full collateral held by SVB for Circle goes to zero. Backing for USDC is 92 cents on the dollar, and there could be a run on the bank. The assets on Circle's balance sheet are liquidated, and in the end we end up somewhere around 90 cents collateral for every USDC in circulation. Maybe they are bailed out, maybe they undergo bankruptcy proceedings for insolvency. It could take some time (potentially years) to get money back out but basically there's a 10% hit for anyone holding USDC, in addition to whatever you calculate your time value of money to be.

If SVB is only somewhat upside down, say 50% of their debts can be covered by their assets, then \~4% of USDC is at risk. Once again, assume a run on the bank, Circle enters insolvency and has to dispose of assets at less than ideal prices, and we get to 95 cents on the dollar. This could take years as we wait on assets from both SVB and Circle to return to the market.

Now let's look at what this means for a stablecoin like DAI, with significant USDC exposure. You can see on the Maker Burn site that there is a significant amount of USDC exposure - $\~3.5B. There is another $5B in other assets. Collateralization ratio is 150%. There are 5.77B DAI in circulation against $8.5B in collateral. The Maker Burn site: [https://makerburn.com/#/rundown](https://makerburn.com/#/rundown)

[Stablecoin Collateral](https://preview.redd.it/nnnwa99x82na1.png?width=2040&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d39e94c7a8cfc3995d7b104d5680db6a886db933)

[Overall Collateral](https://preview.redd.it/vn6j7kjy82na1.png?width=1958&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=101a227a16cb31afa69bc9f098fa095a3233faec)

What does this mean for DAI? Well, in the worst case I outlined above, USDC goes to 90 cents. That means that for DAI, USDC collateral value would drop to 3.15B. Overall collateralization would be $8.1B on 5.7B DAI. It might take time for that full value to be available, however, because the velocity of money is clearly going down.

I suppose if USDC somehow goes to zero, which I think is unlikely, then it would be accurate to say that there would be a collateral shortfall for DAI - something like $700M. However, I think this is a fairly unrealistic scenario. USDC can drop below 20 cents, \~17 cents, and DAI is still fully collateralized.

A few things that this does not consider:

* How much do we believe in MakerDAOs liquidation mechanisms?
* Are we at all concerned that as USDC crashes the other collateral crashes and cannot be liquidated before DAI is insolvent?
* What if we include the GUSD backing and issues that Gemini might be having right now?

I think these are worth further consideration but it's late right now and I'll have to come back to continue the analysis. For now, however, I am going to sleep decently soundly expecting my DAI positions to probably hold up, even if it takes some time to get back to the peg.

If I'm wrong I look forward to the inevitable embarrassment and jokes you all send my way in a few months."

My anxiety spiked after I read Hayden's tweet. He later replied to my DM. We compared notes and it became obvious. Chase Bank's well-managed threats and harassment we endured is part of some plan.

No doubt some of you know Hayden's idea for Aave was born here on Reddit. Crypto was Chase Bank's excuse to target us.

**JUNE 5, 2021**

Chase Bank, without notice or cause, froze my accounts. They threatened to seize my funds, collect a *handling fee,* and forward the remaining balance to the state of California.

It started with a sign-in message - ***account inaccessible to protect it from unusual activity.***

&#x200B;

**EMAIL NOTICE**

[They first lock you out. Then notify you two min after midnight](https://preview.redd.it/uj50d14rg0na1.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e6701405d3810406538f5bfd149611a0e9b72a91)

I was locked out and could not read the letter mentioned above. Why was this happening? Immediately contacted Chase. Used the lengthy hold time to log in to my JPMC equities account. I may need the cash sitting in that account.

**Frozen!**

WTF! They appropriated my:

* *Checking*
* *Savings*
* *Equities*

accounts for no reason I could think of. I desperately needed to speak to someone helpful. Sadly, I was not afforded that opportunity.

The individual who joined me on line first verified my identity, then instructed me to find a new message he had just sent via email. Once I confirmed I was looking at it, he recited this message.

[Felt like I was being read Miranda Rights](https://preview.redd.it/26p8i1gwi0na1.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6647481cdf3912b518880153b98623b8bae1d599)

He refused to engage me on a human level or respond to questions. I could not speak to anyone above him. He reiterated that my accounts were flagged and so were the phone numbers I call from. Only he was authorized to speak with me.

He urged me to collect:

* five years tax returns
* income statements
* business license

and report to an Account Rep at my Chase Branch location on Monday morning. WTF! I demanded that he at least tell me why this was happening.

Said if I was uncooperative or disrespectful, he could exercise the bank's option and initiate a complete garnishment now, and hand my funds over to the state.

In the spirit of honesty, I confess to you that I was intimidated. I felt completely powerless. And I'm ashamed of it. But I didn't know what was happening.

&#x200B;

**EVEN COINBASE HAS BETTER SERVICE**

Then my Coinbase account presented a notification I'd never seen.

I was shocked when they called. The CB Rep informed me they have special procedures in place for Chase's ***periodic disruption efforts.*** This includes a 2FA upgrade. Evidently, Chase notifies them in writing whenever a customer's transfers are being looked at.

&#x200B;

**MONDAY MORNING**

I was now dealing with the good Cop. Then the questions:

* *Why do you deal with crypto exchanges so often?*
* *The bank doesn't look favorably on crypto*
* *Why did you make a large deposit & withdrawal?*

She read my facial reaction and clarified, *were you under duress at the time of the withdrawal?* I'm under duress now!

But that was only what I was thinking. I'm a coward. And they were holding money & stock. I played it like a hostage release.

The account restrictions were lifted after she was satisfied I had been put in my place.

&#x200B;

**ATTORNEY MEETING**

The consult was fast. In summary, attorney advised there was little I could do. The Federal Government had enlisted banks to assist them in managing the Paycheck Protection Program and other 2021 federal aide programs.

Banks were granted **disintermediating authority**. He referred to it as *""banks doing non-bank things.""*  He was aware Chase and a few other banks were drunk on authority. He inquired if the rep had pressured me to speak to one of her brokerage associates?

Yes

Large deposit followed by a large withdrawal drew their attention. They don't like that. I would later learn that [Chase Bank routinely does this to customers](https://abc7ny.com/7-on-your-side-frozen-bank-account-chase-savings/10563609/) throughout the nation.

I had a mini-PTSD moment a few weeks ago. I mentioned in a prior post that I do research on the Limited Liability Network project. A number of transcribed notes from banking participants repeatedly urged CBDC runners for **disintermediation** to make the CBDC launch viable.

I'll soon post those details. But I wished to share this story to raise awareness of what we face.

Best of luck and enjoy your weekend. 🙏🏻

USDC de-pegged and nobody knows where the floor is. Now, it will hurt all investors - institutional to brokers to retail but unfortunately, the retail would be hit the hardest because there was no heads-up and time to cut a deal or swap funds.

So once again, a Bank messed things up and Retail investors got screwed. There is nothing new in this. As long as money is under a centralized body govern by another centralized body for a bunch of centralized bodies - repeated occurrence of this fate is certain. What happened in 2008 financial melt-down and many many times before. 

I think we need to go back to the roots of the genesis of Bitcoin, we need to stop shitting ourselves on random shit (chain maximalism, DeFi, NFT....all shorts of things) and focus on bigger picture. We need to reinvigorate that feeling and energy that as long as disproportionate amount of control of money is in the hands of these centralized bodies, retail will keep getting screwed. Moreover, we need more visibility and accountability (not SEC regulation shit but real mathematical visibility and validation into on chain assets, transaction and risk exposures )

As a crypto community overall, I think we need to stop fighting on our own differences and advance the common vision - a truly decentralized money. That's the only way anything can happen. SEC can't protect Retail, we can. We can protect ourselves."

The thing that is puzzling about this trade is that the DAI is heavily backed by USDC so if USDC goes down it's probably taking DAI down with it. It's a really confusing trade but perhaps he is some sort of trading genius and knows something we don't.

All the big events in 2022, starting from the first major Stablecoin and crypto implosion orchestrated by a fugitive called Do Kwon, up to the events following that such as Celsius collapse and the mega FTX collapse that shock the centralized crypto space, are just additional proof that the true world of cryptocurrency and its movement is the world of decentralization.

The constant FUD surrounding cryptocurrency is basically caused by former Wall Street crooks and other individuals operating in a highly unregulated market that is often driven by artificial hype backed by some strong capital dedicated to Marketing.

This is not the world of cryptocurrency I want to have and experience, and as some of you, one of the main reasons why I even joined cryptocurrency is because of decentralization and not having a greedy middleman in between that is gambling with my own hard earned money.

Most of you didn't experience the infamous 2008 crash, and the main actors of that crash are today here backing up crypto projects with the one and only goal to milk as much out as possible, when things hit the fan, GTFO with no consequences.

I don't really care much about these types of projects in the first place, I never wanted to invest anything into them, but just the fact what massive adoption and capital these projects received is concerning and it leaves a bad taste for potential newcomers into this space.

Decentralization is for me the only way forward because it will take years and years before centralized crypto markets get regulated to an extend that can at least prevent a part of these implosions. Even after that, I really don't believe centralization is the way forward, and I have much more trust in DeFi."

It's important to admit that we may have made a bad investment (or gamble) and lost significant savings. There is no guarantee that the crypto market will recover.

11/3/23,Short Stories of Crypto: A Look Back at Key Moments in the History of Cryptocurrency,"In 2008, a person or group using the pseudonym ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" published a paper outlining a new digital currency called Bitcoin, which introduced the concept of blockchain technology and decentralized transactions.

In 2009, the first-ever Bitcoin transaction occurred when a programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz purchased two pizzas for 10,000 Bitcoin, establishing the value and utility of the digital currency.

In 2010, the first Bitcoin exchange, called Mt. Gox, was launched, providing a platform for people to buy and sell Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

In 2011, a digital black market called Silk Road was launched, becoming one of the most notorious online marketplaces for illegal drugs and other illicit goods and services.

In 2012, the major hack of the Mt. Gox exchange occurred, resulting in the theft of around 850,000 Bitcoin, worth at the time over $450 million.

In 2013, the price of Bitcoin surged to over $1,000 for the first time, as the cryptocurrency gained mainstream attention and interest.

In 2014, the Mt. Gox exchange filed for bankruptcy, further highlighting the need for improved security and regulation in the cryptocurrency industry.

In 2015, the Ethereum blockchain platform was launched, introducing smart contract technology and paving the way for the development of decentralized applications (dapps).

In 2016, a hack of the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) on the Ethereum blockchain resulted in the theft of millions of dollars worth of Ether, leading to a controversial hard fork of the Ethereum network.

In 2017, the price of Bitcoin reached an all-time high of nearly $20,000, before experiencing a sharp correction and volatility.

In 2018, the cryptocurrency market experienced a significant bear market, with prices dropping by more than 80% from their peak.

In 2019, the Facebook-led Libra cryptocurrency project was announced, sparking controversy and regulatory scrutiny.

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and global economic uncertainty led to a surge in interest and investment in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as investors looked for alternative assets and safe havens.

In 2021, the price of Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of over $65,000, as institutional investors and mainstream financial institutions began to embrace and invest in cryptocurrencies.

In 2022, we saw the bear market flourishing with Bitcoin experiencing a significant plunge hovering around $15,000, marking a 75% decline from its highest point. Numerous exchanges and DeFi offerings went bankrupt.

That there is no certainty in banking institutions, or even in the safeguards they assume separated them from crypto exchanges.

Half the brightest minds in emerging technologies just learned first hand the concept of not your keys not your coins. This experience is going to be stressful and for many traumatic, and is the type of emotional event that galvanises new ideas and new convictions. I think it's hard not to change when you go from highly paid developer to one of hundreds of unpaid workers storming a bank trying to redeem your money. 

The exact group of people experiencing a run on the bank right now are also the best situated globally to develop the kind of tools that are going to make crypto accessible to the general public.

Here we talk about this every time we watch a currency debase or a bank go under globally. But this will be the world talking. As with most things it's different emotionally when you see it in your own backyard, when it's your friends and family who are out of pocket. 

Remember that it was the financial crisis that inspired Satoshi to create Bitcoin in the first place, and the bailouts were the message he chose to encode in the genesis block.

Here we can see how on SP Global article it says that Crypto is an actual risk to the ""safety and soundness"" of banks and should thus be regulated in a better way. And many other banks have shared the same opinions.

But if we actually think about what they said, does this mean that Crypto has the power to ""destabilize"" banks? Does a ln asset that they deemed to be ""worthless"" have to the power to ""kill"" them?

It seems like the logic would say that, banks have just exposed themselves with those silly statements that their ""safety and soundness"" can be destroyed by just one asset-class. That makes their ""safety and soundness"" worth nothing."

It is how it is, we can't stop no matter how hard we will try. 

We had 2008 crisis after which BTC was created, then Mr Gox, problems with China,  Luna, FTX, Covid and war in Ukraine or now Silvergate and USDC. And those are just a few apocalypses in last 15 years, in next 15 years we will have the same amount or maybe even more. It is not simply bad, it is also opportunity. Some people get ruined, some make crazy money on shorting. There is always valance. If not those events economy and crypto would be terribly boring and unprofitable. Market can't grow whole time.


Will stablecoins, companies, coins, exchanges or banks stop  dying soon? No. They do it since  first stock exchanges were created in XIX century and even 1929 or 2008 didn't stop anything. Simply it is impossible. If you invest in anything you need to understand all you have  can go down. Only thing you can do is be smart, diversify and don't take unnecessary risk.

In Criminology thee is that one-mistake-doctrine that basically states that law enforcement can make several mistakes in the course of an investigation, but a criminal can only fuck up once and he'll be caught. The Criminal has the disadvantage.

Now with Crypto, this principle is reversed. If you are Mr. Random Joe with his hard Wallet, like the 200k-Guy, you do everything by the book for years and then, because you are in a hurry or because you are distracted you fuck up. Once!

Boom, your money is gone. But the Hackers, if they don't get your money, they'll just try again.

11/3/23,What actually is an ERC-20 token? It's probably not what you think it is.,"Almost everybody in this space has heard the term Token, and the majority have heard the term ERC-20 Token, but I would wager that few really understand what they are, and how they differ from the main asset in the Ethereum network, i.e. Ether.  

Just to be clear, a token is an asset that is created on top of an existing blockchain network.  This is as opposed to what we would generically call a ""coin"", which is the actual asset whose rules for creation, transferring, and usage are governed by the code that runs the blockchain network itself.  On the Ethereum network, things like USDC, Shiba Inu (SHIB), or Polygon (MATIC) are tokens, and Ether is what is commonly referred to as the ""coin"".

What do I mean when I say that tokens are created on top of the existing network?  That's where ERC-20 comes in.  ERC is an acronym meaning ""Ethereum Request for Comments"".  For those of you familiar with networking, the internet is full of protocols that are defined by documents called RFCs, or Request for Comments.  The name is not particularly good at helping understand what an ERC or RFC actually is.  To put it plainly, it's a document that defines a set of rules for some kind of protocol or interaction between nodes on a network, and these rules are debated upon by the community before they come to a consensus.  Hence the ""request for comments"" part.  ERC-20 is the document that lays out a set of agreed upon rules for what a Token on the Ethereum network should be, and how users of the network can use it.

If you want to read the actual standard (it's pretty short), you can do so here: https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/

Ok, now here's the part you probably didn't know.  An ERC-20 token on Ethereum (the same goes for any other blockchain network I can think of that has tokens) is actually just a smart contract.  There is a single contract that is deployed that (hopefully) correctly implements the ERC-20 standard.  It's a very simple contract, and pretty much all it does is maintain a mapping of all Ethereum addresses to their respective balance, keeps track of the current total number of tokens minted, and has functions that can be called to transfer the token, approve others to transfer the token, and a couple other helper functions to do things like get the balance of another address.  

Now, here's the important part.  When you receive an ERC-20 token, **those tokens are not actually ""in"" your wallet**.  Literally all that happened is there the single data structure that is part of this smart contract updated to increase your balance and decrease the senders.  This is all being managed by code inside a smart contract that could have been deployed by anybody.  There is **absolutely no guarantee** that the code for the smart contract for a given ERC-20 token does the same thing as other ERC-20 token contracts, implements the standard correctly, or is free of malicious code and/or backdoors.  When you interact with any ERC-20 token, you are interacting with code that is unique to that token, and it can do things you might not expect.

This is important to understand, because a lot of people believe that all ERC-20 tokens are essentially equal in terms of how you use them, and that once you have them in your wallet, you're safe as long as you don't touch them.  This is a bad assumption to make.  It is extremely easy for someone to make an ERC-20 token that has a built-in backdoor that would allow them to take the tokens from anybody else at any point.  It's also possible to fool people into thinking the smart contract is safe by releasing source code that doesn't actually match the code that was deployed with the smart contract.  This is a thing that happens, it's not just some crazy conspiracy theory idea.  People have even gotten source code audited professionally so they could appear legitimate, but then when they deploy it, it doesn't match the code that was audited.  Since the only truly visible part of a deployed smart contract is bytecode (and not human readable Solidity code), it can be hard to tell if small parts of the code have been tweaked to allow for malicious interaction with the contract.

Keep this is mind when using ERC-20 tokens in the future.  Do not make bad assumptions.

Bonus PSA: NFTs are ALSO just tokens governed by smart contracts that (hopefully) implement the ERC-721 standard.  They, too, can contain backdoors to yoink the NFT out from under you any time the creator wants.  You do **not** actually own these assets.  There is simply a variable that lists you as the current owner in the smart contract, which can be modified by other functions in the contract."
11/3/23,How does a bank collapse in 48 hours? A timeline of the SVB fall,
11/3/23,This is not the crypto apocalypse,"There seems to be a lot of posts of this being another black swan event that will bring in the end of crypto as we know it, and I want to propose another way to look at things. Crypto is currently caught in the crossfire of what is happening to the centralized banking systems of the world, the very thing that crypto sought to fix and repair in the first place. A centralized ""stablecoin"" collapse is not a sign that crypto as a whole is collapsing, but rather a sign that making crypto rely on the mechanism that is sets out to make obsolete is not the way to go about it. 

Stablecoins are very practical in the crypto climate, but are they a necessity? I don't believe they are, and seeing them collapse because of centralized banking almost seems ironic. I feel very much for all the people that have a big portion of their assets in usdc and hope that the situation improves, and the peg returns. At the same time, stablecoins and crypto as a whole have nothing in common at all, in fact they represent completely different systems, one of which, namely centralised banking, is having issues right now, not crypto."
11/3/23,Had an issue withdrawing from binance for the first time,"Had an issue withdrawing from binance for the first time.
As I said been using binance for 2 years now I have been feeling pretty safe with them all this time except today.
For the first time I tried withdrawing my crypto it was asking for something weird about a passcode and it would prompt me to do something with a Bluetooth or USB.
I have 2fa,mobile ,email biometrics never in my life it ever needed anything else whenever I tried to withdraw.
I contacted the support and only then I was able to withdraw.
They told me ""rest assured that your account at binance is safe and will be in the future "" and if I get that error again I should take a screenshot.
I'll be honest with everything that has happened I don't feel safe anymore with them and I won't be using them anymore.

11/3/23,Check and Revoke Your Smart Contract Approvals Regularly,"Your funds are not always safe, even if you use a hardware wallet. Malicious smart contracts can drain your funds without interaction with you, it is enough to sign once a bad smart contract and hackers can move your crypto.

Check and revoke the smart contracts you signed once on a regular basis. I do it every other month, because i can not track all the smart contracts i sign during the interaction with different dApps, bridges, swaps, etc.

A Ledger hardware wallet is good, but it is still possible, that you sign a malicious contract and you think that Ledger can save your funds - but it is not the case, because you signed that contract.

You can use [https://revoke.cash/](https://revoke.cash/) to check what contracts are signed with your wallet address and you can revoke them.

You can use the smart chain´s own scan site to check the contracts are assigned to your wallet address. Your wallet must be connected to the site to interact with the smart chain. I collected some of the most important smart chain´s token approval sites:

1. ETH: [https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker](https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker)
2. BSC: [https://bscscan.com/tokenapprovalchecker](https://bscscan.com/tokenapprovalchecker)
3. Polygon: [https://polygonscan.com/tokenapprovalchecker](https://polygonscan.com/tokenapprovalchecker)
4. Arbitrum One: [https://arbiscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker](https://arbiscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker)
5. FTM: [https://ftmscan.com/tokenapprovalchecker](https://ftmscan.com/tokenapprovalchecker)

If you do not know, why a contract is signed, than just revoke it. Later if you need to use it again, you can just sign it. Spend a few seconds more, or spend some gas fees to sign a contract, rather than to regret once someone drains all your crypto, because you were lazy to review all your smart contracts.

It  is always possible, tha someone may have unintentionally accepted a malicious contract, that is only waiting for a particular amount of funds to steal, or a  hacker may discover a flaw in a contract that is acting properly and  find a way to exploit it. 

Be careful out there, there is always someone who wants to steal your crypto funds!"

It seems like our rally that started in early of this year has most certainly ended. Now all the focus should be at trying to identify where this downwards is going and we should do some damage-control of the effects of the fear over the last days.

One very good way to do that is to use one of the most popular indicators, the Relative-Strength Index  (RSI). This is used to see the speed and direction of a certain move, which will be illustrated on a scale of 0 to 100. There 50 builds the border of oversold (bearish) to being above 50, meaning overbought (bullish).

Here we can see the RSI over the last months, after our rally in early of this year it even exploded to levels not seen since the 2021 bull run, which makes sense if you look at the parabolic run-up. Since the it has steadily been declining and now with Silvergate and the whole banking sector in trouble it has hit level similar to the FTX implosion.

The interesting thing though is that, while the RSI has hit similar levels to the FTX collapse the price is still 25% off the FTX lows, forming a possible higher low. This structure of RSI to price can be called hidden divergence if the RSI were to make a lower low now, this is seen as a bullish “buy the dip“ pattern."
11/3/23,remote crypto-job or crypto-gains & life: how and where?,"The craziness of urban life seems to have taken over our and previous generations, I'm from Spain and it is not a process unique here. People have been fleeing from rural areas more and more, so lots of rural towns, huge states, and provinces are literally becoming deserted. 

With the advent of the internet and telecommuting some voices said that would change the way we live and money could be made even from cheap and isolated areas if and when the internet is available.

Some people who live in the city, maybe a minority, think of living in an idyllic isolated house far from noise and pollution as a dream. **Where they can stop paying exorbitant rents for tiny apartments where life is miserable and they live in ""big-cheap houses"", open spaces, enjoying the freedom of nature and away from the schizophrenic reality of cities**.

Do you know of someone who works in tech or crypto-related fields who is living this way?

Or do you know of someone who thanks to crypto gains left the city and lived a more pure life in the countryside or a more rural and small town?"

11/3/23,"If DeFi platforms need/use stablecoins as benchmarks for trades, and if stablecoins are backed by TradFi, isn’t DeFi just TradFi with extra steps?","Please put your stones down. This is a genuine question from a very newbie in DeFi.

My little, almost non-existent understanding of DeFi is that you have a platform where people can trade assets via contracts and that no single entity has the power to shut the network down. What am I missing?

Other questions:

1. As per the title, if banks are backing the stablecoins used as benchmark in the trades, isn’t DeFi just TradFi with extrasteps?

2. If a single, private entity issues the stablecoins used as benchmark in the trades, and these are backed by assets stored in TradFi, isn’t DeFi just TradFi with extrasteps?

I have a really hard time understanding the descentralized aspect of this whole thing, because it seems there will always be a TradFi player that could disrupt it all. Is this word used because of nodes in the blockchains are supposedly decentralised? Or is it because of any financial aspects?

Thanks a lot in advance. Just trying to understand the scene better."

11/3/23,Is it possible to steal my cryptos with a compromised SIM Card?,"I am in Vietnam right now and bought a SIM Card at the airport 2 days ago. After the registration for an online messenger app named Zalo (what’s app of Vietnam I guess) the app showed me that there is already somebody registered with this number. That made me curious. I also read that stores in Vietnam sell preused Sim Cards to tourists.

So I am using this SIM card for 3 more days. Just using it for data. I have coins on my cold wallet Ledger and on my Trust wallet. I opened both apps while using this SIM card (unlocked apps with Face ID). Is it technically possible that they can get access to my phone (IPhone 14) or wallet with an compromised Sim Card? Can they somehow see what websites I open and what I do on my phone?

I did not enter any passwords or seed phrases. Just unlocked the wallet apps with Face ID.

Or am I too paranoid?

I am asking because I posted something on a Fragrance group on Facebook. And an hour later I saw a scam post from the app Zalo on the same Facebook post. They were asking for money."

11/3/23,Interesting Price Discrepancies,"I noticed this morning SushiSwap is routinely showing MOON value about $0.02 higher than CMC and Coin Gecko.  While I know this can happen to a DEX, there are a few reasons today looks different.   
 When a token is as low-cost as MOON a few pennies means a significant amount of money in terms of percentage (and potential earning).  For example, my stack of MOON is listed by MetaMask as worth $7100 yet SushiSwap says it's worth $7947 at the exact same time.  Keep price slippage in mind if you decide to trade, although that's not so bad these days thanks to ETH/MOON pool liquidity many r/cc members are providing.

As the price of MOON has gone up this morning the difference remains the same, where SushiSwap stays almost $0.02 ahead of CMC and further than that ahead of Gecko.

11/3/23,Crypto is fine..Take a deep breath and put things in perspective. Yellen has told us that everything is fine.,"After the 2001 attacks President Bush told his serfs/citizens to go out and spend their money to keep the evildoers from bringing the economy down.  What followed was a decade of prosperity and economic stability in which ordinary Americans were free from hardship. 

My point is, they've got this.  Okay, SVB is the second-largest bank failure is US history but our overlords are our overlords for a reason.  There is a rigorous moral and intellectual screening process for anyone with political power in the USA, that's how I knew that Clinton wasn't a serial rapist and instead, obviously, dozens of women from all over the country independently made up horrible lies about him.

We've got unpredented levels of debt nationally and globally, so if we're having problems now it's obviously because we're not creating enough new debt.  Time to open new credit cards and use them to buy crypto.  You can literally buy a dollar for 90 cents right now (USDC).  Come on, this is obvious."

BlockFi has over 227 million in Silicon Valley bank

In short summary the crypto banks are collapsing, Biden has decided to tax not only our MOON bags but also the air we breathe, Massive institutions like Circle and BlockFi are unable to access their reserves and BTC is fighting for its life around 20K..."

11/3/23,The collapse of the criminal banking system is a good thing for Crypto and DeFi. This could be the catalyst we are waiting on….,"With all the noise coming in about Banks and their financial state, I can only think: *Isn’t this what we have all been waiting for?*

I am guessing the contagion from SVB is going to spread like wild fire. From my understanding, SVB was one of the “good ones”, with an actual conservative balance sheet compared to many others. This tells me it’s just the first of a long line of Banks failing.

*Remember 2009-2011??*

***During those 3 years, 389 Banks Failed.*** [Source: FDIC](https://www.fdic.gov/bank/historical/bank/)

And guess what? SVB was the 2nd Largest collapse since Washington Mutual in 2008 from a value perspective. [Source](https://adamtooze.substack.com/p/chartbook-200-something-broke-the?utm_campaign=auto_share). Now this tells me that this is just the beginning…

However, There was a major difference from Today, than in 2009-2011. In 2009, Bitcoin was just in the conception stage. It was hardly even in an infancy stage, and the Crypto industry hadn’t even begun yet. Today, people are well aware of Bitcoin and DeFi. We are nowhere near Mass Adoption yet, *but are we???*

***”In 2021, the assets of banks globally amounted to almost 183 Trillion dollars…”*** [Source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/421215/banks-assets-globally/)

Now imagine what would happen if a Bank Run occurred on a Global level, and people began to pull their money out of the Banks. Where do you keep Trillions of dollars in a Safe place, where No Centralized entity could access and control your Funds?

*Not your keys, not your Crypto…*

So let’s have fun and run some numbers *(get those calculators ready)*.

Let’s say a Global Bank Run is occurring, What would happen to Crypto? 

*Example #1:*
***1% of Bank Assets move to Crypto, or $1.83 Trillion Flows in. This would potentially triple the value of BTC.***

*Example #2:*
***5% of Bank Assets move to Crypto, or $9.15 Trillion flows in. This would potentially 10x the Value of of BTC.*** (Where’s my BTC to $200k people?)

*Example #3:*
***10% of Banking Assets move to Crypto, or $18.3 Trillion flows in. This would potentially 20x the Value of BTC.***

So on and so forth. You see where I’m going with this??? Time to Jack those Tits.

***TLDR:*** *A Global Bank Run could be the catalyst which ignites Crypto and propels Mass Adoption. If even a minute amount of Cash flows into Crypto, we will see fireworks. The next few weeks and months will be very interesting. Buckle up!*"
11/3/23,Crypto industry braces for impact with Silvergate exit,
11/3/23,Optimism will overtake MATIC!!??,"**OP V/S MATIC!!!** 

I have tried my best to compare the two chains . I will try to keep as brief as possible.

First of all some basic stuff we all know. Both are L2 protocol that solve the gas and speed problem of L1 ethereum chain

**FOUNDERS:**

Optimism was founded in 2019 by Jinglan Wang, Karl Floersch and Kevin Ho.The team started it as a non profit organization caleed ""plasma group"".The stack is open source so that anyone can see it.

The Matic Network was launched in 2017 by four Mumbai-based software engineers: Jaynti Kanani, Sandeep Nailwa, Anurag Arjun, and Mihailo Bjelic. A large part of the project is open source.

Both of them have a strong team but OP is better here in my opinion.

**TOKENOMICS:**

Optimism has eth for gas fees on its chain and with only 7.3% current circulating supply I believe a lot of selling pressure is going to come on the OP token as it is just a govenance token.

[Image from coingecko](https://preview.redd.it/b776oy8iz4na1.png?width=753&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1029e75998f194804ad682da63e17000eac8fd8d)

Matic has a current circulating supply of 87% . The demand can counter the remaining supply release as it is the used for gas and various other uses. Also a proper burn system that burns roughly 0.27% of tokens every year (it ain't much but its honest work).

[Image from coingecko](https://preview.redd.it/6ola7q3bz4na1.png?width=753&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=71cebe43574c01cc2b52b486f1be3aad4e14753f)

clearly Matic is a winner here

&#x200B;

**GOVERNANCE:**

OP token lets you participate in the optimism collective that is two tier governance system containing token house(vote with token) and citizens house(vote with their membership NFT).This system of praised by Vitalik Buterin as well

https://preview.redd.it/1v9nw4od05na1.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a789ecee84949cf375ea5246e9f9ec5f813ec278

Matic : WTF is this governance we don't believe in it. It is for cowards. Jokes apart, there is no system  of governance for token holders right now but will be there soon. It current has DAO which helps in governance and decision making.

https://preview.redd.it/x5r7n64h05na1.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8019a16ef48644a5aa8d2728d4c8a45b4657cd49

OP is the winner for this.

&#x200B;

**TPS and Roll-ups :**

&#x200B;

Optimism: Optimism's solution is an Optimistic Rollup, which allows for off-chain computation and batching of transactions. Optimism uses  fraud proof system to ensure the integrity of the transactions. Optimism's Optimistic Rollup can handle up to 2,000 transactions per second (TPS). However, Optimism is still in its early stages and has not yet reached its full potential

Polygon: Polygon uses Plasma and Optimistic Rollups. It uses fraud proof system called TrueBit, which is more efficient and scalable. Polygon's network has achieved a TPS of over 7,000 on its Optimistic Rollup solution. Polygon has also implemented other Layer 2 solutions such as Plasma, which can further improve TPS.

&#x200B;

Matic is current winner but things may change in future.

&#x200B;

**Current Chain Usage (Live TPS) and TVL:**

MATIC is current winner because of age factor.

**Some Notes:**

I have not compared them on number of Dapps as optimism is quite new and polygon has been here since longer duration and thus has significantly higher number.

Both Optimism and Matic are not very ideal when it comes to decentralization. However, both have them have plans to change this.

OP also has a bad history of hacks and mismanagement of token in airdrop but will cover it later. For those who don't know:

https://preview.redd.it/42k2l8zc25na1.png?width=682&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ee9af93e0b6ff79830a90af333b40c5e1eee7be1

In my opinion MATIC is a overall winner for now and OP will have to work hard to beat it.

11/3/23,Investing should not be fun.,"Greetings from Portugal.

I imagine some of us here really like gaming. As is well known, game developers take use of a fairly tiny population to make large sums of money. They achieve this by falling victim to addiction.
 
**CEX and other investment firms are aware of this. I believe that investing in cryptocurrencies exhibits the same predatory behavior as investing in corporations.**
 
This is being achieved by turning the entire investing process into a huge game, in which clients compete for high scores utilizing confetti animations and financial instruments to which they should not legitimately have access.
 
The exponential growth of online communities and the never-ending list of TikTok cryptocurrencies pickers are also to blame.
 
**The plumbing in your home should be boring, and so should good investing. It's crucial to have a fundamental understanding of how everything operates so that you can work quietly in the background to get the job done, or at the very least, know a decent professional who could set things up for you.**
 
Gamifying investing also disadvantages investors by shortening their HODL periods. We all know that having a diverse portfolio is crucial for accumulating long-term wealth, but the diversity of the time horizon over which the portfolio is kept is also crucial. Putting money into both good and poor times.
 
People frequently make all-or-nothing bets with their investments because they are aware that everything has become unaffordable and that even the most meticulous investing strategy won't enable them to reach their financial objectives. The only chance is that they know and are willing to take chances.

I would love to hear the community's thoughts on this!

Thanks!"

11/3/23,The Flight from Banks/Exchanges/Stablecoins to Bluechip Self Custody,"These why I believe in BTC and ETH.

Third party risk is just not worth taking right now. The music is stopping and we are seeing who is dancing naked. Questions are being raised over USDC and we are seeing a bounce in BTC and ETH as people swap to assets they can own without third party risk. We have also seen a relative bounce in USDT to $1.01 but to me the only difference between the banking risk of USDC and USDT is the transparency between the two. 

The small bounce in BTC and ETH off recent lows is interesting because it shows we can go one of two ways. Out of stablecoins and into USD held in a bank. Or the bankless way into self custody of permissionless decentralised currencies. It's amazing to see demand for the bankless way.

This demand for the bankless way is also showing up as huge demand for ETH blockspace in the form of high gas fees as people withdraw from exchanges and swap out of USDC. Eth critics will point to this as a scalability issue but by the same token it's also proof people are willing to pay a lot to use the network in a time of crisis.

I'm currently considering sending all of my stables( USDT and USDC) to kraken and Binance and swapping them to USD, and relying on USD from now on for all my transactions.

I know it's a bad idea to keep crypto in a cex, but it seems like it is an even worse idea to keep it in your wallet with this ongoing domino effect with the stables and how vulnrable they seem to the centralized crypto industry.

What do you think plebs about this plan? And do you think stables will someday become a safe option for DCAing into crypto?"

Hello All! Like many of you I am stuck with a bit of A recently depegged coin($300). Not a catastrophic amount but and amount that I don’t want to lose.

I signed up for a coinbase card last year and it is set  by default. I just used it to spend most of the $300 online. I was able to check out and it deducted from my Coinbase holding

I am sure this would only help a small amount of people but if you have some stuck in coinbase and have a card you can spend it. I know other exchanges also have cards so maybe it would work there too.

Hopefully this helps some people."

People make fun of those who didn't sell when their project peaked, and some are outright regretting and kicking themselves. At the same time, people praise those who held on to Bitcoin when it went from 1 cent to $10,000. So, because Bitcoin made it, these people are considered geniuses. However, for some projects where people held on to an asset only to see it plummet 90%, they are called idiots or greedy for holding on too long.

&#x200B;

What gives? The only common thread is that people have the benefit of current knowledge and can point out mistakes. This is the same for buying in. If Bitcoin had really taken off to $100,000, the same people who are kicking themselves for getting in at the peak would have been called talented investors. And so forth.

11/3/23,Thoughts about seed backup,"So it's been 2 years now since I'm invested in Crypto. Been DCAing since, bought my hard wallet, transferred all of my tokens in it, written down my seed. Alright.

But what about any backup ? I mean, I've written my seed on a piece of paper, hid it somewhere real hard to find but in the end it's physically in my flat. So many things could go wrong :  
What if a fire comes up ? What if a flood comes up ? What if I get robbed and the guy takes what contains my seed without even knowing what he took with him ?  


My point is, I don't feel secure having only one seed written on a simple piece of paper, stored in one physical place.   
I don't want to make a copy of it and store it in a bank. We're all in the crypto world for a reason, which is to avoid banks.  
I can't make a copy of it and give it to one or more people since I don't have any close family, or any enough trusted person.  
I don't want to make a copy on a steel plate to be fire/flood resistant, since the point is not to store it in the same physical place.  
I don't want to learn and remember it, since I don't trust my brain enough on the scale of several years/decades.  


So...what are my options ? Can you think of something that would be an efficient backup ?  
I've thought of encrypting it and storing it in a local password manager but the single act of writing it on a digital object is making me paranoid.

Any advice regarding using a ledger will be welcome. I was looking to purchase one from Amazon and some of the reviews on there are from people saying that they lost all of their crypto shortly after transferring it into a ledger. There are far more positive reviews but it is still concerning to hear people have lost their crypto when in cold storage. I take it the general idea is to not interact with the crypto at all once it's in cold storage? Also, will it open me up to more phishing the more times I deposit into the ledger? If I DCA every week, then at what point is it considered good practice to deposit the tokens to the ledger?

Additionally, how does the Ledger Live app work? Will I need this to interact with my crypto in the wallet? If so, how can I be sure that the Live app doesn't get hacked? What if Ledger goes out of business and the app no longer works - will that mean that I can't access the funds? Also, if the Ledger breaks, will I lose access to all of the tokens on there or will I be able to use my seed phrase on a different Ledger?

Sorry for all of the questions!"

https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/money-and-payments-20220120.pdf


Federal Reserve policymakers and staff have studied CBDC closely for several years, guided by an understanding that any U.S. CBDC should, among other things

• provide benefits to households, businesses, and the overall economy that exceed any costs and risks;

• yield such benefits more effectively than alternative methods;

• complement, rather than replace, current forms of money and methods for providing financial services;

2 Money and Payments: The U.S. Dollar in the Age of Digital Transformation

 • protect consumer privacy;

• protect against criminal activity; and

• have broad support from key stakeholders.


TLDR;  a CBDC would be held as a liability on the Fed’s balance sheet (such as cash).   The Fed believes a CBDC would be better utilized as commercial money liability, used to move money between the Fed and it’s bank customers.  This means the banks will likely continue the current stablecoin system when they are given regulatory clarity and permission.

I know a lot of people are here for the posts about price action, speculation, etc., but I think there are also some that are interested in the technology behind cryptocurrencies and blockchains.  Most have read the well-known Bitcoin paper, but I bet a lot of people are not as familiar with the history of cryptocurrencies/digital cash prior to that.  I am a professor who teaches cryptography and I thought it might be fun to start a recurring series of posts where we learn about and discuss one important paper at a time in cryptocurrency history (maybe also cool new papers if people are interested).

If you are not very technical, I will write a summary of the key points to start the discussion, but I really want to hear what you guys think about these things!  Many people are surprised to find out that Bitcoin was not the first cryptographic currency.  In that light, I figured a good place to start would be the original [privacy-preserving E-cash protocol, by Chaum, Fiat and Naor](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/0-387-34799-2_25.pdf).  It was published all the way back in 1988, in the journal *Advances in Cryptology*.

# Background

Prior to this paper, there was a vague idea that you could use public-key cryptography (which was also pretty new at this time) to implement some kind of digital currency system, but it wasn't completely fleshed out.  Even at the time, they realized that the main challenge was preventing a wallet from double-spending.  We all know that Bitcoin solved this problem with PoW, but back when this was written they relied on more centralized techniques.  The easiest thing you can do, if you don't mind a bank being in control, is to have the bank verify with merchants every time a digital coin is spent and make sure that it is never spent twice.  This is basically the role that banks take now in the debit card system, they verify when you buy something that your account has enough money.

However, the simple way to make this work involves the bank just checking directly against your account, which is not only under the central control of the bank but it reveals your identity to them every time you buy something.  Again, this is already how debit cards work, but academics were trying to come up with a digital version of cash: it should be spendable in a way that **does not reveal your identity**.  That's where this paper comes in...

# Main Idea

The goal of this work is to create a digital coin (called Ecash) that is something like a stablecoin, but with more privacy.  An exchange could issue Ecash at a 1-to-1 ratio when you trade them USD (or another fiat currency).  You can then spend that Ecash with a merchant, and they can exchange it back for USD with the exchange.

The architecture for this is very different from what we would recognize from modern cryptocurrencies.  The user, lets call her Alice, does not have her own private key for her wallet.  The coins themselves, which are for a specific amount and can't be subdivided (like regular cash) are each made up of a small list of keys, and knowing the keys for a coin allows you to spend it.  The coins are also not fully transferrable, you can only spend them one time and then the receiver has to trade them in at the exchange, either for fiat or fresh coins.

There are two really interesting techniques used in this paper.  The first has to do with how Alice can trade in fiat for Ecash in a way that is not traceable to her.  This was a big concern for academics at the time, who were looking to replicate the anonymous nature of cash in the digital world.  The trick is that she has the exchange use a **blind signature** on the coins when they are minted.  This is a variation of a regular digital signature, where the signer actually does not know what they are signing.  You can think of it like signing a piece of paper with your eyes closed: your signature gets on it, and people can verify that you signed it, but you don't know what it was that you signed.

This way, Alice can create the keys for the coins, trade fiat to the exchange, and have the exchange blindly sign her keys.  This means that when she spends those coins in the future, nobody, not even the exchange who issued them, can tell her identity!  And multiple coins issued to the same person are also completely indistinguishable from each other.

The second technique involves the method they use to stop Alice from spending the same coins twice, at two different merchants.  It is a classic cryptographic tool called cut-and-choose.  The idea is that the merchant presents some challenges to Alice and for each of her keys she has to reveal one half of the key, the left or the right.  There is enough information in these half-keys to check whether they are correctly formed and signed by the exchange, i.e. a valid coin.

Because these challenges are random, which half of each key you ask for, if Alice tries to spend the same coin again at another merchant it is extremely likely that they will ask for the other half of one of the keys that the first merchant didn't ask for.  Here is the amazing part of the protocol: the keys are designed such that when you get both halves, you can recover Alice's identity!  So if you are an honest user, you will have guaranteed anonymity and privacy in your transactions.  But, if you try to double-spend then the two people who you ripped off (via the exchange) can get together and find out who you are, call the police, sue you, etc.

It intricately ties privacy to honest behavior, and aligns the incentives so that it is in your best interest to act nicely.

# Pros

\- Completely anonymous digital currency.  This is one of the most interesting parts of the history of this field, we actually started out with more privacy than we have now!  Bitcoin is great for a lot of reasons, but it is a step back in terms of privacy.  This protocol gives even more privacy than even Monero does currently.

\- Very efficient, doesn't require any significant computation.

\- Fits seamlessly with existing currency systems (basically a stablecoin).

# Cons

\- Tied to a fiat currency.  This is not actually required, you could just mint Ecash directly, but it wasn't the intention of the work.

\- Relies on a central exchange/authority.  They know a user's identity at the time of minting and so could deny someone access.  After minting, the exchange can't block a particular user's transactions, though, because everyone is anonymous.

\- Can't be broken down into smaller denominations without trading back to the exchange.

\- Is not actually fully transferrable, the recipient needs to trade the coins back to the exchange for fiat or to refresh them into new, spendable coins.

# Legacy

David Chaum turned this idea into the first cryptocurrency company, Ecash, which raised $10 million back in 1990.  However, it went bankrupt in 1998, despite being right in the middle of the eCommerce boom.  It turns out, people didn't care about privacy (sound familiar?) and were fine just using credit cards.  Chaum:

>As the Web grew, the average level of sophistication of users dropped. It was hard to explain the importance of privacy to them

I think the main legacy of this now is in projects like Monero, and Zerocoin.  It took more than 25 years, but people now have a popular use for anonymous digital cash: buying drugs online!

Now it appears as the r/Cryptocurrency favorite, USDC, has also depegged. I admit that I own some myself and considered this to be the “safest” stablecoin. This depeg was not the fault of developers at all, and simply due to the bank collapse that could not be forseen.

But that begs to question, is USDT actually the safest stablecoin at this point?? I know that it gets a lot of flak from this sub, but it might now be the best legitimate option.

My guess is that USDC will repeg by Monday, but at this point it is hard to say that Tether is the absolute worst stablecoin. It is the one major player that has yet to depeg."

11/3/23,Here are the possible outcomes of this SVB situation.," Circle has 8.25% ($3.3B) of its reserves tied up in SVB. Now there are two scenarios that can play out:

1.**Bailout by another bank**

Another bank can takeover SVB & pay back the creditors & depositors of the bank. If this doesn't happen in a week or two, it won't happen at all. It's like the FTX situation we saw earlier in terms of a bailout, if nobody steps in within 1-2 weeks, a bailout is unlikely since it means nobody wants to touch that mess. 

2.**FDIC bailout**

As opposed to FTX collapse, SVB is a bank, so FDIC has to step in.

FDIC will first start selling any assets like bonds to pay out the minimum $250k FDIC insured amount to the depositors. But we already know that interest rates are high which lowers the value of those bonds. So the actual hole might be greater than 8.25% considering the liquidity crunch.

Next, FDIC can issue an ""Advance dividend"" to cover a percentage (x%) of the uninsured amount & paid to depositors & creditors. This % is determined by various factors.

What is Advanced dividend?

It's basically is a payment made by FDIC to uninsured depositors in case of a bank collapse.

### Value of USDC

- As of now the value of USDC must be considered at $0.9175 since there's an 8.25% hole on circle's balance sheet.

- After receiving the FDIC insured $250k + assuming a generous 50% advanced dividend, That'll still leave a hole of 4% on circle's balance sheet. At this point the value of USDC can be considered around $0.96

- But all this is optimistic, in reality USDC is having a bank run & it doesn't matter that there's only an 8.25% or ~4% hole (in best case scenario), the selloff pressure will tank the price. 

- I'm sure there will be a lot of rebounds & hopes for re-peg, but math is math, a 8.25% ($3.3B) deficit is no small amount. 

- Unless option 1 happens & another bank takes over, a re-peg to 1$ is highly unlikely."

There are a lot of lending protocols out there. Some are much more reputable than others.  I am not going to recommend one, but you can go to Defi Llama and see who the big players are in the game.

1. Deposit your preferred stablecoin that you think will remain stable (some might say USDT is a good one to do this with at the moment)
2. Borrow a stablecoin that you do not think will remain stable (some might say USDC is a good one at the moment)
3. Sell USDC for USDT
4. Repeat the process multiple times over to get leverage on your stablecoin
5. When you are ready to exit, buy USDC to repay your loan. If you were correct in your predictions, USDC will be trading at less than $1 (or the price that you paid for it)
   1. If you do this strategy now, USDC is trading \~5% less than USDT so if it regained peg, you could potentially lose 5%

Galaxy Research's [own take](https://www.galaxy.com/research/insights/top-stories-of-the-week-3-10-23/) on KuCoin suggested the same for the US: 

> Some important things to note here. KuCoin is not an American company and **has a history of ignoring US law suits**. If they ignore this suit as well, that means KuCoin will not respond to this complaint and the case will therefore end in a default judgment against KuCoin.

So what's going to happen if they lose the lawsuit? Well, it's far from the end of crypto for the United States. **This only affects New York state**. The NYAG is attacking KuCoin because they are marketing crypto as an investment.

If it loses, it will need to do the following:

1. Stop labeling itself as an exchange
1. Bars its own operations in New York based on geolocating customer's IP addresses

So it's a narrow lawsuit. New York residents already used to losing access to crypto exchanges due to their overbearing regulations."

""Silicon Valley Bank is a critical bank in the U.S. economy and its failure—without a Federal rescue plan—will have broader implications for business, banking and entrepreneurs.""[Source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/03/11/43-billion-nightmare-sudden-circle-depeg-could-be-about-to-crash-the-price-of-bitcoin-ethereum-bnb-xrp-cardano-dogecoin-polygon-and-solana/amp/)


Because USDC is such a big player in the crypto space, it’s fall could trigger a domino effect. We’re already seeing that with DAI, another stablecoin on the ethereum blockchain. The problem is USDC represents 51% of DAI’s collateral. If USDC falls, it can take DAI down with it. DAI has depegged and is 0.93 at the time of this writing. 


So the immediate effect of Silvergate and SVB debacle is that it has depegged USDC and DAI. If these two major stablecoin don’t find their pegging, that will spell doom for crypto and bring about a crypto winter. 

Why? Because stablecoins were supposed to be a safe alternative to fiat. Big players, like tech start ups and other big whales, who thought bitcoin and eth fluctuations were too spicy went to stablecoins. For these guys, it’s stabelcoins or bust. 

And if the whales begin moving money out of USDC and DAI and exiting the crypto space, that will tank the crypto market for the foreseeable future. 

If big money leaves, it will be like the old days when crypto was dominated by the little guy, the small investors. And turning back the clock, the value of crypto will also once again reflect that."

11/3/23,Explain like I'm Crypto naive; why would people hold large stores of crypto in a stable coin?,"I think I understand the benefits of using stable coins, in that day to day you can normally expect to get the same amount out as you put in, eg. I sell an item for $100 and I get paid in stable coin, when I come to use that money it's still $100 and hasn't gone down (or up). 
It's better for sending cash, especially abroad as it's instant and there's no extra fees or conversions (except gas?)

But why would I hold large sums in a stable coin. Why wouldn't I use fiat or another coin for example BTC or Eth for that?"
11/3/23,What is USDT? Let's look at arguably the last survivor,"This crypto winter has been eventful from lawsuits to falling stablecoins, It is time we look at the most controversial yet widely used stablecoin USDT.

Each USDT token is supposed to represent one US dollar, and Tether Limited, the company behind USDT, claims that it holds reserves of US dollars that back each token in circulation. This is intended to give investors confidence that they can redeem their USDT tokens for US dollars at any time.

Some USDT biggest news that we might have missed.

* Tether claims its stablecoin is now partially backed by non-U.S. government bonds ([Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/19/tether-claims-usdt-stablecoin-is-backed-by-non-us-bonds.html))
* Myanmar’s Shadow Government Adopts Tether as Official Currency: [Report](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/13/mynamars-shadow-government-adopts-tether-as-official-currency-report/) 

Widely Used stablecoins!

1. **~~TerraUSD (UST)~~**
2. **~~BUSD~~**
3. **~~USDC~~**
4. **USDT**

**How it is pegged?**

USDT is pegged to the US dollar through a process called ""collateralization."" This means that Tether Limited, the company behind USDT, holds reserves of US dollars that are equal to or greater than the number of USDT tokens in circulation. 

The company claims that it maintains a 1:1 ratio of US dollars to USDT tokens, which means that there should be enough US dollars in reserve to redeem every USDT token in circulation at any time.

As most popular stablecoins got in the crossfire of legal conflicts, USDT overall market cap has grown significantly.

When BUSD was in trouble its market cap was around $69 billion, now it's $72 billion. and now holds 51% market share of stablecoins.

Some pessimists ask these two questions:

1. Does Tether Limited really have enough US dollars in reserve to back every USDT token in circulation?
2. Is Tether Limited transparent enough about its reserves and the process of creating and redeeming USDT tokens?

Anyhow, its standing tall and growing bigger every single month.

11/3/23,Story about SVB and what I learned over the past few days,"I'll first start out with the TL/DR

**As a popular saying in poker goes, ""It's better to be lucky than good""**

My company is a startup and SVB was the first US bank we used back in 2017. In 2018, we had about $5 million with them and all of our US business was going through SVB. We were evening buying treasuries with our excess cash.

In the middle of 2018, we started a blockchain project. Most of the payments were made through our foreign banks, but we had an advisor in the US and he wanted to be paid by a US bank. I made the payment, but I added a note in the payment saying ""blockchain advisor.""

Almost immediately, I started getting emails from SVB's risk and compliance. They were asking me a bunch of questions about this transaction. What exactly was it for, were we involved in any ICOs, etc... I went back and forth with them for a few months explaining what it was, but the questions kept coming.

Then one day, our account manager told us they would be closing our bank account, and we had 30 days to transfer our money out of the bank. If we didn't transfer the money, then it would be frozen and could potentially be forfeited.

Needless to say, I was pretty pissed at the short notice. They never gave a clear explanation for why, just that we needed to comply immediately. I'm based outside of the US, and our founder and I took a trip to the US specifically so we could open another bank account to support our US business. 

Obviously with what has happened to SVB these past couple of days, this has been a blessing in disguise. It caused a lot of headache at the time, but it has obviously saved us a bunch of money.

On the flip side, one of our good friends who's working on an analytical tool for NFTs has all the money he's raised from investors in SVB. He only managed to get a small portion out on Wednesday. He is already asking us if he can work for our company if he has to close his company down :(

Is there really any difference between him and us? Not really. He just happened to be with the wrong bank at the wrong time. We just got lucky that SVB decided to close our bank account in 2019. Even funnier was that it was most likely due to our blockchain transaction, even though nowadays, a lot of SVB's clients do blockchain and Web3... 

Sometimes in crypto, investing, poker, and life, it's better to be lucky than good."

11/3/23,Coinbase Support dropped the ball BIG time and didn't tell me someone tried to fraudulently register an account with my info until months later,"This might come off like a bit of a rant and perhaps I'll seem upset... but frankly, I am.

About 2 weeks ago, I was checking my Coinbase portfolio and realized a number of coins that were staking on Coinbase hadn't received any rewards since last year. I don't actively check my staking rewards and it just never stood out to me.

I spoke with a Coinbase chat agent who told me my staking rewards were paused because I had registered a second account with Coinbase, and violated their policies. I assured the chat agent this was NOT the case and I'd never had any other accounts with Coinbase and asked for more information on this supposed 2nd account. They told me they'd open a support ticket and I'd hear back from Coinbase via email. I again asked for more info as I didn't want to have to wait days for an email if someone was out there registering accounts using my ID, and they refused to tell me anything and closed the chat so I couldn't keep asking questions. It was frustrating, to say the least.

I tried calling their 1800 number, and of course it just sends you through an endless hell of robotic prompts and there's literally no way whatsoever to speak to a live agent. It literally tells you to submit a ticket online and hangs up and disconnects the call if you ask for that option.

Days went by before I received the following copy/paste email from Coinbase Support:

&#x200B;

>*Thank you for reaching out to us. We can see that you contacted us through our chat support and were transferred to email for further assistance regarding the fraudulent account set up using your email address.*   
>  
>*We have reviewed your account and it appears that the fraudulent account you have mentioned has already been deleted.*   
>  
>*We take security at Coinbase very seriously and we encourage you to read into our implementations here:* [*https://www.coinbase.com/security*](https://www.coinbase.com/security)*.*   
>  
>*If you have not already done so, we recommend that you change the password and enable 2-step verification on your email account.*  
>  
>*If you're still having issues, please let us know.*  
>  
>*We appreciate your patience and understanding.*

&#x200B;

That's it. No details on the fraudulent account or whether someone was using my personal info. No mention of the staking rewards. Just this generic, insultingly lazy email.

I took a few days to calm down before responding but just sent a rather stern and direct email back, expressing my disappointment at the lack of urgency and customer service on their part. I asked why they quietly froze my staking rewards months ago when they first noticed the fraudulent account, instead of bringing it to my attention at the time so that I could take the steps needed to ensure my account was safe and to also contest the accusation that I had registered it myself (since I absolutely did not).

If they truly thought I registered a second account and didn't recognize it as fraud, then why didn't they at least give me some sort of notice that my staking was being frozen as a result? Why would they just secretly disable this feature without telling me, but continue to allow me to spend money on their exchange buying more tokens?

Meanwhile, for the past few months I had absolutely NO knowledge that someone had attempted to register using my info - because they didn't tell me... and even now, I have no idea to what extent my identity was ""stolen."" I don't know if this person just used a variation of my email (i have a gmail address and periods aren't recognized, so my assumption is someone used a variation of my email with a period in it because I've had this happen in the past with some other websites), or if they literally tried to register using stolen ID.

All of this being said... u/Coinbase support needs to do better. Way better. This is simply unacceptable.

I told them I expect all my staking rewards to be retroactively credited for the months and months that they were quietly disabled without my knowledge, but I already know they will refuse to do that, if their previous level of customer service is anything to judge by.

An infuriating experience and another reason not to hold coins on exchanges, tbh."

11/3/23,To people holding mostly or all stables: why?,"Like the title says. I am trying to understand the psychology of holding stables in this space.

As we know, crypto is insanely volatile. While we have endured a heck of a bear market. The gains on the upside are also insane and sometimes, unfathomable.

For me personally, I hold no stables, because I'm not in this space to have a ""stable"" experience and try and time a bottom to reenter. I'm here for the insane gains and the potential for life changing money.

The yield of last year was definitely something I was interested in getting into, but thankfully I didn't make the steps to do so, who knows what yield platform I would have gone into.

So for the rest of reddit, why stables? Are you waiting for an entry point? Are you chasing yield? Because why not hold fiat then? Less risk imo.

Curious to hear the different perspectives."
11/3/23,Conspiracy: federal gov is sabotaging stable coins in debut of their CBDC,"This is entirely a crazy viewpoint and there’s no way to prove or disprove this. 

We all know who’s fault Luna was, then binance stable coin fud, and the stable coin we all know and love depegging as well as DAI, and tether fud has practically been around as long as Bitcoin.

Should we consider the possibility that the federal government shutting down the Silicon Valley bank freezing there 3.3 billion dollars of assets forcing the stable coin to depeg is a strategical move to make sure another stable coin goes under so that they can make more market room for their CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency)? 

The government will want their CBDC to dominate and I’m sure it will intertwine with crypto the issue with that is the government will track your every movement by every cent you spend. It will give them much more power no just with information but also because they can freeze your money at any point in time without it being in a bank.

The government has assassinated people and overthrown countries just for money and power, toppling a small bank would be small cookies. There’s no way to prove or disprove this but we have to consider the possibility of fowl play. The government hates crypto for the freedom and anonymity it can provide.

And if this is true what stable coin will they go after next? When will the CBDC launch? When all the stable coins have fallen? What do y’all think?"
11/3/23,"Amazon entering the NFT market will be ground-breaking, changing perceptions about Web3 / NFT / Crypto / Blockchains. Overall, it's going to be great news.","So before i go into why Amazon - A Giant corporation adopting NFT will be groudbreaking, here are 2 big previous events that changes common perception about NFT.

1 - Reddit Avatar. Reddit avatar comes into NFT market calling it Collectibles and create mass adoption while many people don't even know these are NFT. and people love it. 

2 - Starbucks entering the fray as well. Starbucks NFT sold out as soon as it launched. Also it is called Stamps.

Both of these events, have something similar There are feature behind these NFT . While both serve diff purpose, one being able to be used as profile pic, ability to mix and match, and the other one having perks at Starbucks, it differentiate them from the regular JPEG images NFT. 

Now with amazon coming into the scene, their NFT too will have features for example tied to real world asset. 

All these can actually be called as the Real NFT - Digital Asset. 

For the most part, mass adoption is hard because the thinking is, why would someone buy a jpeg. Use it as screensaver? 

It's different when it's actually tied to real world asset, have utilities. This will create new understanding to people who think NFT is just about images. No. Those are just a small part or the testing part of NFT. 

Amazon being an online shopping portal, will be able to educate mass population about what is Real NFT technology and what is just some images with 0 purpose. 

A large adoption into NFT market will in-turn create bigger influx toward crypto such as ETH and ofcourse Bitcoin. 

Future is looking good toward new era of NFT and Trusted coins."
11/3/23,Web 3 is going to save crypto,"Web 3's features and the tech behind it come together to make a winner.

Not other proposed use cases pertaining to using crypto as legal tender (lolz, this is really is pie in the sky thinking, Google Gresham's Law if you don't believe me), video gaming, NFTs etc.

Why Web 3:

* The practice of logging into a Dapp via your digital wallet account is awesome. So much time and hassle is saved from not having to constantly sign-up and create new accounts for new platforms, along with needing to devise and remember different passwords for different accounts;
* I would also guess that the above effects (with mass adoption) would be better for the environment. Your wallet details are your login details, so there is no longer a need to create what are essentially replica accounts for all of these different websites. Fewer login accounts attached to  websites means fewer resources expended on storing and maintaining relevant data;
* In a Web 3 universe people are more likely to spend money online on a wider variety of products, including tipping others for services, online newspapers and blogs and video content. I believe this would be the case because the initiation and processing of payments would be much smoother in a Web 3 universe. This is in part because there would be less of a need for an intermediary in banks, which in turn makes online payments much simpler and CHEAPER to execute. Some people today still feel weird about making a $1 payment via a card, and more times than not, the opportunity for such a transaction isn't possible as a result of high merchant banking fees. With that said, using this as a tool for fiat currency transactions would best help in maximizing the benefits;
* It's helping us look at, use and transform data in new, unconventional ways

So yh, there's my take. Have I gotten anything badly misunderstood here? Still learning about crypto like the rest of us :)"

First time saw a bitcoin was back at 2010-2011 it was an advertising on Facebook, remember reading something like that, buy the new currency so you can make safe payments for online shoping like eBay, I was ready to give a try and purchase 5 for almost 5 euros but I scared because clicking transfered me to an unknown site for me asking to put my visa card ... I can not recall my memory if I ended up buying or I was scared and left it...

That was the first and last time I saw about bitcoin till the summer of 2020 June when reading on Google news I found a post about bitcoin and the price to 8000 euros ! I said to my self wait I know that name from somewhere, bitcoin hmmmm and then a flash on my mind and the memory of 2010  in my mind made me 😱 my 5 euros if I had take the choice to spend them would be now be worthed 40.000????
This is where I start reading to find out what is bitcoin what is crypto currencies and started to make small purchases hopping for a miracle, but really small as I was broke and without job for few months so was like something 20 euro or 30 euro per month.
At December of the same month I found zilliqa and moonlet wallet, a wallet for your zilliqa coins, they had a competition for the price that zilliqa will have at the end of January 00:00 (midnight), everyone was able to give 5 perdition and the closest one would was be the winner, I predicted exactly the price zilliqa had at 31 of January at 00:00 it was 0.0692 usd !!!
Moonlet send me 20.000 zilliqa, plus 7000 more that I was able to purchase till then I had a total of 27.000 zilliqa and nothing more!!! After 2 days I sold 200 euro of zilliqa and decided to purchase another coin with the money, I bought harmony one because was very similar to zilliqa and I was believed, I still believe , one of the 2 will be succed, I bought one at 0.0059.. euro almost half a cent, after almost one month maybe one and a half one price skyrocketed to 0.18 cents!!! I ended selling one at 0.13 cents... things was moved amazing in crypto back then...
Years passed and I stayed faithful to zilliqa and a small portion of bnb and btc, don't  have much but if the price goes back to where it was would be a nice amount for me
Currently have 40.000 zil hopping for the price to regain"

Assuming it regains its peg value, that is an easy 10% increase to your portfolio. 

TLDR on what happened, worries about the impact of Silicon Valley Bank’s failure drove it down from $1 on Friday. An undisclosed portion of USDC’s cash reserves are parked at the now-failed bank, leading to concern that mogney backing the stablecoin is now stuck.

That said, it does seem like the exposure is way less than when Terras stable coin kicked the bucket. Banks are closed during the weekend so it will be interesting to see what happens this upcoming with USDC come next week.

10/3/23,Be Aware of Double Top Patterns,"What is a double top pattern?  Double top pattern is formed when you have two peaks that are close to one another but is widely considered bearish because after the 2nd peak, the price dumps down.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I have been trading frequently in crypto since 2017 and have done relatively well these years.  Starting from 2021 and onward, I have been seeing these double top patterns arise quite frequently across all time scales and in most of these cases, this pattern has been my Achilles heel when it comes to trading and from that line of reasoning, I decided to make a post on it to discuss/share with others.   There are some premises here about psychology of crypto trading.

1. When Bitcoin starts going up and up without any correction, traders/investors are obviously ecstatic but they are fearful about the impending drop.  So there is high likelihood of taking profits during this initial ascension stage.
2. When Bitcoin corrects from this initial top (the first peak), traders are not dumbfounded by this as this is widely expected.  Most people trade well here since they have taken some profits near the first peak and is now dip buying.
3. Bitcoin now goes up again towards the second peak.  Traders pat themselves on the back for their nice trading.  And this is important.  The ""fear"" that they had in 1) is now completely gone.  The traders feel like Bitcoin has paid its due in the correction from 2) and now is ready to go way beyond the peak value from 1).
4. In many cases, Bitcoin does go beyond the first peak value from 1) but there is no longer fear from the investors.
5. Bitcoin drops/dumps like a brick (after the 2nd peak) and everyone is dumbfounded as no one took profits from the 2nd peak.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

So that is the psychology of it and this is important because I see double peak patterns arise more frequently the past few years across all time scales.   Some examples.

&#x200B;

Example of longer time scale

A) Double peak pattern from March-May 2021 (64K) and November 2021 (69K).

After the COVID drop, Bitcoin went from 3-4K (March 2020) to 64K (March 2021) without much meaningful corrections.  With the alt season under way in early 2021, many people were confident that there will be a big correction.  Remember, people are psychologically prepared to sell the 1st ascension.  So I was in the same boat and sold at Bitcoin = 58K in May 2021.

Bitcoin did correct during the summer of 2021 (\~28-30K) and then made a second ascension until November 2021 up to 69K.  Now, my anecdotal evidence suggests that people were no longer afraid of the correction because Bitcoin paid its due in summer of 2021.  So not many people sold the Nov 2021 top.  I couldn't do that either and we saw a double top pattern that left the traders holding their bags from 69K to 20K of now.

Example of shorter time scale

B)  Double peak pattern from Jan 2023 to now

After looking like it was dead in the water, Bitcoin surged by 50% from 16K to 24K in just 1-2 months in 2023.  Again, this type of surge without any correction led to many people talking about the need to take profits or a correction occurring.  I took about 20% profit at 24K.  And then to my delight, Bitcoin did correct to 21.5K before bouncing.  And it bounced up to 25K that AGAIN, I felt a sense of security since I felt like Bitcoin paid its due in the correction to 21.5K.  So even though Bitcoin was at a higher price (25K) in the second peak compared to the first peak (24K), my sense of security was much higher.  So I didn't sell and now we see this drop to 20K.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

TLDR:  Be aware of double top patterns as it is occurring frequently.  The price pattern lulls traders into a sense of comfort in the second peak as it seems like Bitcoin paid its due in the correction to the first peak.  This is where many traders go ""all in"" (after the correction to the 1st peak) and get destroyed."

11/3/23,Eulogy: Bitcoin 2009-2023,"Ladies, gentlemen and degenerates,

Today we gather to pay our respects to Bitcoin, the groundbreaking cryptocurrency that captured the hearts and imagination of people around the world. Bitcoin was born in 2009, a creation of a mysterious figure known only by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. From its humble beginnings, it grew to become a global phenomenon, with a market capitalization of over a trillion dollars at its peak.

Bitcoin was not just a digital currency, it was a revolutionary idea that challenged the traditional financial system. It offered a decentralized, peer-to-peer network that allowed for secure and anonymous transactions without the need for intermediaries such as banks or governments. It was a symbol of individual freedom and empowerment, a way for people to take control of their own finances.

Unfortunately, people were unable to cope with this ampunt of freedom and responsibility. And now, as Bitcoin dropped below the 20k line again and USDC is in peril it is time to bury its bits and bites once and for all.

So as we say goodbye to Bitcoin, let us not mourn its passing but celebrate its legacy. Let us remember the ideas and values that it represented, and the impact it had on the world. And let us continue to push the boundaries of innovation, using the lessons we have learned from Bitcoin to create a better future for all."

11/3/23,"Love Banano? Gridcoin does everything Banano does, but better.","I get it, Banano is fun, but if you think Banano is cool, wait till you hear about Gridcoin because you have been missing out.

Here's why people love Banano:

* Fun community
* Rewards folding @ home
* Feeless
* Low environmental impact
* 1 BAN = 1 BAN

Plus potassium right? Lots of potassium good? Everybody knows Bananas have tons of potassium... only to be beaten out significantly by the humble potato which has about 40% more. Yet nobody talks about potatoes. Nobody is handing out potatoes after a marathon even though they are a richer source of potassium and about a tenth of the price. In many ways bananos = bananas and gridcoin = potatoes. What Banano is prized for, Gridcoin does and does better. So let's get into it.

# Folding @ home

Banano: Banano rewards participation in Folding @ home, which is a medical research project. You contribute CPU/GPU cycles, you get BAN. It's pretty awesome, and noble. It's done in a centralized manner and you can't choose your team of choice on Folding @ home, you have to crunch for the Banano team. Because Banano's rewards for Folding come from a centralized purse, they will eventually run dry whenever whoever is in charge of them decides to stop.

Gridcoin: Gridcoin also rewards folding @ home as well as about [a dozen more scientific research projects](https://gridcoin.us/guides/whitelist.htm) spanning everything from Alzheimer's research to mapping asteroids and finding pulsars. When you fold, you can choose whatever team you want, and you can even earn curecoin at the same time, which means you get twice the coins for the same work.  It does this in an entirely decentralized way using a system of federated oracles. Coins are minted for you and guaranteed by protocol design. Gridcoin also has a number of CPU-only projects where you can earn more and not have to compete with GPUs.

# ""Feeless""

Banano: **Banano is not actually feeless**. For one, like regular Nano, it [requires proof-of-work](https://boompow.banano.cc/) as an anti-spam measure, that's essentially a fee. Plus, **Banano has an** [**absolutely massive pre-mine**](https://www.reddit.com/r/banano/comments/n5wfl1/banano_distribution_numbers_update_552021/), a purse of coins set aside for the devs and coin creators which is about 60% of the entire supply. So for every coin you, as a regular user have, devs have 1.1 coins. This pre-mine essentially means there is a 60% fee on the entire market cap of Banano, and when the devs decide to dump their purse, think about how that will impact your BAN. Should the coin of the future be distributed this unfairly?

Gridcoin: Gridcoin doesn't claim to be feeless, but it has no pre-mine for devs. Transaction fees are less than one cent USD and have been for years with no sign of that really going up anytime soon. At current rates, the coin can continue to grow for years with no increase in fees.

# Low Environmental Impact

Banano: Banano says because of it's DAG structure, it's low on environmental impact, and it's hard to argue with this. Compared to traditional PoW coins, Banano's carbon footprint is extremely low. But it does still use PoW for anti-spam. I'm assuming nobody is sweating the environmental impact of Folding @ home, after all, it's going to a good cause.

Gridcoin: Gridcoin uses pure PoS for its consensus layer with no PoW component for anti-spam, making it have a **lower environmental impact that Banano**.

# 1 BAN = 1 BAN

Banano: Yes, supply is limited, 1 BAN will always be 1 BAN.

Gridcoin: Like many PoS coins, Gridcoin has a built-in currency inflation to reward stakers and secure the network. This means your 1 GRC will eventually be 2 GRC. **You get no staking rewards with Banano**. And you can start staking with as little at 1 GRC.

# Fun Community

Banano: No argument here, y'all are very fun and great at getting newbies interested in crypto, **hats off to Banano!**

Gridcoin: Gridcoin's community is smart, vibrant, and dedicated at its core to the advancement of scientific research. Like Banano, we have tip bots, giveaways, and other fun events to build community.

# Exclusive features

Banano: There are no features Banano has that Gridcoin doesn't.

Gridcoin:

**Polls** \- **You can vote on network-wide polls** to decide which projects get incentivized. Should we put all the incentivization money towards Folding @ home or distribute it among more projects? All big decisions like this are put to network-wide polls. The more GRC you have and the more computation you do for science, the bigger your vote.

**ASIC-Resistance** \- The coins used for Gridcoin's PoS consensus layer are minted for scientific work, as the work varies and constantly changes, this makes it the most ASIC-resistant coin in existence. There are CPU-only projects as well, so you can fold w your GPU and get more out of your CPU by crunching for those projects where your CPU doesn't have to compete with GPUs. This also helps with decentralization. Unlike other PoS coins, you don't need to buy your way into the system or have access to an exchange, you can simply fire up your CPU for science and earn your first few GRC.

**Decentralization** \-  It is also way more decentralized than Banano. **Banano's massive pre-mine means devs (or anybody who gains access to their wallet) can 51% attack the network anytime they want, it's not decentralized at all**. You can run a full Gridcoin node on a standard PC and that will remain true for years to come. We have more active full nodes than most coins in the top ten, over 5,000 of them! This makes the cost of entry to become a ""validator"" the cost of a computer and a network connection. Compare this to coins like ETH which require thousands of dollars of ETH and approval from the existing validator set to become a validator, yikes!

Gridcoin has been doing all this since 2013, it was one of the first ""altcoins"" developed. It is majorly slept on and actively developed, we have a new economic layer coming which will enable buying and selling some of Gridcoin's computing power which measures in the many petaflops.

I love this coin, and I think if you look into it, you will love it too."
11/3/23,Why wouldn't you switch from fiat to crypto now?! Your money is not safe in centralized fiat based entities.,"Centralized fiat based entities like these banks and, so called ""stable coins,"" which aren't decentralized, are falling like dominoes.   All those tech startups with their money in SVB are screwed.  We're already hearing whispers of them posponing upcoming payrolls.  These companies need to move their funds into BTC and ETH.  No chance of the massive fiat banking rugpulls on-chain.  Their funds would be safe.  This is why Satoshi made BTC, as a response to massive fiat based banking/market failures of the 2008 crash. 

 Maybe this banking disaster will be good for crypto, with businesses/institutions migrating away from holding their funds in unstable centralized fiat-based entities, and instead keeping them on the blockchain.

Addendum:
We should go en masse on Twitter and tell all the tech start-up CEOs: ""Hey, tired of losing your money in the unstable fiat banking system, come to BTC and ETH! Your money will never get locked up here!"""
11/3/23,You had one job.,"In January 2009 in the midst of the financial crisis where big banks were falling due to not having enough cash to cover customers withdraws, cryptocurrency was developed. In specific, Bitcoin. Bitcoin's one true job was that it was to prevent anything like this from happening by providing a decentralized money platform. In fact many state on the blockchain it is stated that they do not want ANY government bailout because that in the creator's stance is against the true nature of what Bitcoin is designed to be. 

&#x200B;

Bitcoin was designed to prevent the problem which effectively Bitcoin has created for it's self.

&#x200B;

Since the founding of bitcoin, numerous crypto exchanges most notably Mt. Gox and FTX and Voyager, have failed. Every time a major exchange fails, just like a big bank fails, it drags the entire market down. FTX drug Bitcoin down a good almost 50% from 24k to 14.9k. Silvergate has now drug Bitcoin from 25k to 19k. Meanwhile the failure of Silicon Valley Bank has only drug the KBE banking index down maybe 10% so far. Yes - one could argue the KBE banking index has much further to fall if the instability continues to snowball but - well - that's kind of a known know almost by design if you will because the financial system is more centralized and central banks will probably bail those poor ""non crypto"" SOBs out. 

&#x200B;

I call SVB kind of a pivotal moment here because it is vindication of being a huge crypt bear - all the crypto banks that failed first, in something that was supposed to be decentralized but is now turning out to not be decentralized at all - and laughable, because you know the government will likely bail out the \~$200 billion dollars of deposits customers had, but there is no chance in hell that the FDIC will ever want to refund crypto customers of failed exchanges. And crypto again says that is not the desired situation either - crypto needs no bailout.

&#x200B;

So long story short. Bitcoin had one job. But in the end, Bitcoin is just another centralized platform that every time an exchange fails it drags the entire ecosystem down with it due to speculation. We should have never allowed crypto exchanges to establish themselves in the first place, because the entire nature of an exchange one could argue ruins the entire decentralized nature of crypto. You can still take your crypto off to a hardware wallet, but you have to be careful about who actually has custody of your crypto in a off-exchange wallet. After all, Ledger was backed by FTX."
11/3/23,Why the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank is good for crypto,"As most of you already heard, this bank is collapsing and having an impact on stablecoins and start ups.

Hundreds of companies using SVB will be unable to pay wages and are at risk of bankruptcy.

Some have already argued it’s unnecessary panic and it’s just a liquidity issue. 

Let’s assume this is accurate and consider the best case scenario.

Everyone gets there money back and now they look for a new bank.

Or wouldn’t it be better these companies take control of their own money, convert into crypto and also start paying wages in crypto.
This way they won’t be at risk of an other bank having liquidity issues and being unable to pay employees.

What’s your take on this?"
11/3/23,I am pissed. There is no proven connection between Silicon Valley banks bankruptcy and crypto. Stop saying there is unless you can prove it,"It’s one thing to watch Silvergate Bank go down in flames and have zero FDIC backing and everybody lose money. Yeah that sucks, but crypto is really about self custody. NYKNYC.

It’s one thing to watch SBF implode as a ponzi and, once again, no FDIC backing, you lose most of your money. 

It’s one thing to watch the blocked sale of Silvergate by the SEC that would give everybody $.78 on the dollar to those folks.

It’s an ENTIRELY different story to be blamed for Silicone Valley Bank, which is not involved in crypto, IS FDIC BACKED, be blamed on crypto. STOP IT. They’re not connected. This is a classic case of a bank exploding because they aren’t smart. And it’s a CLASSIC case of bailing out a blown up bank.

Bitcoin was literally invented as an alternative to this exact scenario. That bank bought 10 year treasuries, had a bank run, and could not sell those 10 year treasuries because 2 year treasuries are 5%. It’s a classic liquidity issue. We’ve taken so many black eyes, so many beatings by the SEC. It’s like the narrative is turning into the overdose medicine caused the overdose. It didn’t.

EDIT: of course I understand they held some stable coins reserve in fiat. So what??? I am saying that crypto did not cause this collapse, the BANKs decision may cause a STABLECOIN to collapse. And it should. What an idiotic idea to link a crypto to legacy banking, even a stable coin. DO NOT perpetuate that crypto led this bank to collapse."

Bitcoin is down again, yes, but 3 potential things can come of this.

First is bailouts. Honestly I was a little surprised a bailout didnt come of Silicon Valley Bank. The start-up community is REKT. No one wanted to step in and help? Crazy. But with bailouts comes the ol’ money printer that would send Bitcoin right back up again.

Secondly. No bailouts. Whoever survives, survives. Breadlines. Mass depression. Mass job loss. Hyperinflation. Probably the least likely scenario. 

Third. War-footing economy. In order to save the legacy financial system, and prevent another Great Depression, America finally launches into World War 3. 

Either way, lots of people lose. But Bitcoin will win.

This is a Bitcoiner’s wet dream.

I work at a Biotherapeutics startup where we are creating therapies to cure cancers with natural killer cells. My first one-on-one meeting with our CEO, we actually had a small argument over Bitcoin. He said it was like the old tulip bubble, I explained why that perception was completely wrong and said I actually don't trust the banking system. Our company's investments are held in this very bank, and we received an email regarding this.

More banks will suffer from the Fed's overreaching via quantitative tightening from the mass inflation caused by their own printing of trillions of fiat from thin air. The US debt ceiling has to be perpetually raised, and the dollar will perpetually be debased. When the banking system fails more, the government will pivot from raising interest rates and begin to cut rates and print more fiat to bail out the banks. Never ending cycle that inevitably makes fiat lose value. We've witnessed the bank runs in Greece, the hyperinflation in Turkey, Venezuela, etc. Jerome Powell and the Fed are intentionally creating economic slowdown that will bring recession and will print more money to keep the scheme going as a bandaid every time, its how our antiquated money system is set up, and the majority of our generations will suffer. 

Simply holding cash means losing roughly 8-10 percent of its purchasing power each year. Fiat has infinite supply and is meant to debase into nothing, as it is backed by nothing. To quantify it, US banks have 17.6 trillion in deposits, only 3.1 trillion is backed by cash, with only 100 billion is backed by physical cash. Fractional reserves at its worst."

11/3/23,"This is what bitcoin bros mean when they say ""bitcoin, not crypto""","I'm not a hard line bitcoin maxi, but I do agree generally with that sentiment.

This technology was built to insulate us from this kind of stuff. But what do the crypto bros build? Shit that's exposed to risk in the traditional banking sector, dressed up as cryptocurrency. A bank collapses and several of these projects take a hit. They're not cryptocurrency in the way we talk about it, theyre not decentralized, they're not in any way shape or form a part of a separate, permissionless financial system.

Now let's talk about stablecoins. You hear from lots of people something along these lines: cryptocurrency is unstable and volatile, for adoption we need something with a stable value. The usual bitcoiner (and some others) is usually that you're not insulated from debasement risk by the central bank that controls the fiat these stable coins are pegged to or backed by. But that's not really the only or even the worst risk of these types of things.

There's asymmetric, downside only risk to holding these things. Imagine you've got a stablecoin worth a dollar each, and the peg breaks, it becomes worth $1.10. What are you likely to do? You're likely to sell it to make some free money, wait for the price to go back to a dollar and buy back for a free 10% profit. This puts downward price pressure on the stablecoin and helps keep the peg. Sounds good.

Now, the reverse. You have a stablecoin worth a dollar and the peg breaks and it's worth $0.90. What are you likely to do? Stablecoins breaking peg are big hits to their perceived value, *you're likely to sell what you have at a 10% loss to avoid losing more money.* some enterprising people might buy thinking the peg will be restored, but for the most part there's likely to be downward price pressure due to such a depeg.

*In both circumstances a sell off is likely.* This means there is always more downside risk than upside to holding stablecoins. The risk profile is asymmetrical.

Is this the stability that is going to bring adoption? Continued exposure to traditional finance systems, a cap on any upside on your savings, a guarantee that one day the peg will break downwards, and of course, exposure to debasement?

Stablecoins, particularly those backed by fiat, are a worse place to store your money, even with high volatility. They're not the magic bullet. They're generally a bad idea.

The only ""stablecoins"" that make any sense would be coins backed by commodities like gold, in a vault, audited and proven periodically. But those aren't really stablecoins, those are tokenized commodities. They can reduce your exposure to this market and still have symmetrical risk profiles.

Another type would be algorithmic ones *not collateralized with anything inside a bank*. DAI fucked up when they allowed USDC to be used as collateral, they ceased being purely algorithmic backed by collateral.and became partly backed by bank reserves, thus exposing them to the banking system. Even without that they're still exposed to debasement risk but at least that's a known risk they're choosing. People didn't buy DAI to basically have their dollars in a bank uninsured. Ideally a token like this would be pegged to a commodity to avoid that risk, and not a fiat currency."

11/3/23,I want to help my dad understand Bitcoin,"Hi everybody. I’m in need of help. I’m looking for a site, a piece of text or whatever that compounds what bitcoin is and why it’s good. Why it can solve problems that exists in the current banking system.

I’m in the process of trying to get my dad to understand bitcoin, but it’s very hard. The whitepaper is good and i’ll send him that, but i’m also looking for something that kind of compounds why bitcoin accually is needed and explains it. I think he’ll understand it better if he reads it than if he hears it from me.

Price history is no matter, i bought my first btc in 2016 for ~$600 and he knows it, still doesn’t get it or believe in it. This is more about understanding than price.

Haven’t talked that much about it with him tho. But he always advices me to not buy more and be ready to sell ”while i’m still in profit”

I was emailing a contact at the Federal Reserve, and this was his defense of quantitative easing:

""the injection of capital was needed to make sure that firms and households survived the sharp recession. Are we now suffering the consequence from injecting a lot of money into the economy (in the form of inflation)? Absolutely. Would the economy have gone through even sharper and perhaps longer recession in the absence of these capitals? It’s hard to know since we don’t have the counterfactual, but probably.""

11/3/23,If Bitcoin price skyrockets will people with few money still buy it?,"I´m wondering if Bitcoin let´s say reaches 100k or even 1 million will people with few money still buy it? Although nowadays it´s no big deal technically to buy fragments of a value asset so people with few money can just buy a small proportion of Bitcoin. But it could be a psychological thing as for Bitcoin there is no such thing like stock splits. Yeah, I know Bitcoin isn´t a stock, but I think that´s not the point here.

Stock splits typically drives the demand upwards as the asset seems cheaper to the average buyer. If the Bitcoin price skyrockets and you only have few money it might seem unattractive for you to invest in Bitcoin because you think it´s so expensive and you get only a small proportion of Bitcoin.

So could the lack of something like a stock split significantly decrease the demand for Bitcoin in the future and if yes what could be a solution to that problem?"

11/3/23,Value of Uncensored BTC in the Event of Widespread Financial Lockdown?,"Let us suppose there was some theoretical black swan event that caused a widespread lockdown of markets and banking account transactions, crippling TradFi at large.

In what ways would BTC become beneficial given that it is uncensored and could continue on-chain transactions?"
11/3/23,"Hear me out, this is just some thinking of mine and want to hear your thoughts","Let's say bitcoin in the future has been fully mined. That would mean in order to gain bitcoin you would need to do or sell something to get it (or inherit it).

So let's say you are early in the game and make something which is necessary for humans to survive and you are the only one with enough resources to be able to make this. You need to use X bitcoin to make that something but sell it for 2X bitcoin every Y years which means you make X bitcoin in profit. Over the years you and your family will gain more and more bitcoin because everyone needs what you make but everyone else will have less and less bitcoin to use to buy what is necessary to survive.

How can bitcoin be the future of money in such a scenario?

To me it sounds impossible because noone would want such a future. If bitcoin would be the future of money that would mean we would have a very dystopian looking future where most of humans are slaves and some are like gods. And the population would dwindle until there would be not many left because of the unlimited greed of some people. Yes or no?

It just struck me but currency like this is the cause of every large empire where there were emperors or kings etc. Money can buy power, and with power you can get more money. And if there would be such a thing as an absolute money you would be able to get absolute power.

Do you want such a future?"

**The case for:**

If it re-pegs, it's an easy 10% gain.  Only 25% of USDC's reserves were in cash, and of that 25%, SVB was one of six banks they were using. Rumor on Twitter was $3B of the $41B total was at SVB.

So 90 cents *should* be the lowest it would go as of right now.

**The case against:**

Fear could drop it further.  Much further.  While there isn't the same type of mechanism in play, watching UST death spiral to zero is fresh in the minds of crypto investors.

And who knows, SVB contagion could run around TradFi over the next few weeks/months, like Luna/3AC did all over crypto last year.

The last two days have been quite a ride. First Silvergate and now this USDC debacle. Granted the outcome it still to be determined. USDC valued at 94 cents is not a good thing. What I ask myself though is if this is an urgent call to sell my USDC or if it is a great opportunity to buy USDC. Dilemma with Emma.

I have no clue what I am going to do as I have no clue what the market is going to do. What I do know is that my USDC sits in a pool with some eth as it depegs and that I also have some dry powder ready to go waiting for an opportunity like this. I just have a hunch circle should be fine and the USDC dump is just FUD so buying seems like the right choice. Or maybe not? Ugh. I can't make up my mind?

About 2 weeks ago, I was checking my Coinbase portfolio and realized a number of coins that were staking on Coinbase hadn't received any rewards since last year. I don't actively check my staking rewards and it just never stood out to me.

I spoke with a Coinbase chat agent who told me my staking rewards were paused because I had registered a second account with Coinbase, and violated their policies. I assured the chat agent this was NOT the case and I'd never had any other accounts with Coinbase and asked for more information on this supposed 2nd account. They told me they'd open a support ticket and I'd hear back from Coinbase via email. I again asked for more info as I didn't want to have to wait days for an email if someone was out there registering accounts using my ID, and they refused to tell me anything and closed the chat so I couldn't keep asking questions. It was frustrating, to say the least.

I tried calling their 1800 number, and of course it just sends you through an endless hell of robotic prompts and there's literally no way whatsoever to speak to a live agent. It literally tells you to submit a ticket online and hangs up and disconnects the call if you ask for that option.

Days went by before I received the following copy/paste email from Coinbase Support:

&#x200B;

> *Thank you for reaching out to us. We can see that you contacted us through our chat support and were transferred to email for further assistance regarding the fraudulent account set up using your email address.*   
  
>  
>*We have reviewed your account and it appears that the fraudulent account you have mentioned has already been deleted.*   
  
>  
>*We take security at Coinbase very seriously and we encourage you to read into our implementations here:* [*https://www.coinbase.com/security*](https://www.coinbase.com/security)*.*   
  
>  
>*If you have not already done so, we recommend that you change the password and enable 2-step verification on your email account.*  
  
>  
>*If you're still having issues, please let us know.*  
  
>  
>*We appreciate your patience and understanding.* 

&#x200B;

That's it. No details on the fraudulent account or whether someone was using my personal info. No mention of the staking rewards. Just this generic, insultingly lazy email.

I took a few days to calm down before responding but just sent a rather stern and direct email back, expressing my disappointment at the lack of urgency and customer service on their part. I asked why they quietly froze my staking rewards months ago when they first noticed the fraudulent account, instead of bringing it to my attention at the time so that I could take the steps needed to ensure my account was safe and to also contest the accusation that I had registered it myself (since I absolutely did not). 

If they truly thought I registered a second account and didn't recognize it as fraud, then why didn't they at least give me some sort of notice that my staking was being frozen as a result? Why would they just secretly disable this feature without telling me, but continue to allow me to spend money on their exchange buying more tokens? 

Meanwhile, for the past few months I had absolutely NO knowledge that someone had attempted to register using my info - because they didn't tell me... and even now, I have no idea to what extent my identity was ""stolen."" I don't know if this person just used a variation of my email (i have a gmail address and periods aren't recognized, so my assumption is someone used a variation of my email with a period in it because I've had this happen in the past with some other websites), or if they literally tried to register using stolen ID.

All of this being said... u/Coinbase support needs to do better. Way better. This is simply unacceptable.

I told them I expect all my staking rewards to be retroactively credited for the months and months that they were quietly disabled without my knowledge, but I already know they will refuse to do that, if their previous level of customer service is anything to judge by.

An infuriating experience and another reason not to hold coins on exchanges, tbh."

But anytime a crypto brokerage is pausing any type of transaction it immediately sends up red flags. I just pulled all my investments off of Coinbase tonight. 

I realize I could be mistaken and every scenario is different, but I would be concerned if I were any of you with too much to lose on Coinbase. 

I understand this could just be a one off pause while USDC is trading less than the actual price of the USD, but if there’s a bank or Coinbase run it could get ugly. By the way, I didn’t realize back in June of 2022 Coinbase said for their books they would combine USDC and USD. So if there is a USDC issue I’m sure Coinbase has an issue.

after that i became interested in what kind of other common scams there are and what i should watch out for?

Giving a bit of context for it, the hackathon is focusing on building privacy dApps on EVM and also on improving the user experience by adding privacy to existing dApps, using the Oasis Privacy Layer, powered by Sapphire. At the end of last year, [Sapphire](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/get-to-know-sapphire-the-industry-first-confidential-evm-paratime) has been launched on Mainnet, being the first confidential EVM compatible paratime, that allows the deployment of confidential smart contracts. The [Oasis Privacy Layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l620x35Z0AM) has been officially launched at ETH Denver, and it offers customisable privacy, a built-in message-passing bridge and a gas relayer, so that there will be no need for swapping. 

The OPL can be used either for governance, where the secret ballot tools play an important role, gaming,SBT’s, or even for NFTs, for fractional or hidden ownership. 

The hackathon has been recently announced, so there are still a lot of details to be shared, but all the available info can be found right [here](https://oasisprotocol.org/p4w3-hackathon)."

This script can be used by businesses or individuals who want to create their own crypto wallet app without investing the time and resources required to build a new one from scratch.

The clone script is designed to be customizable, meaning that you can modify it to meet your specific requirements.
