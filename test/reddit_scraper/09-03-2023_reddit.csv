8/3/23,$100 in ETH if you guess the order of my seed phrase (24 words),"Last week a poster wrote in asking how safe it would be if someone knew their 24 seed phrase words but didn't know the order. The comments in response were basically split between ""It would be trivial to brute force it and compromise the wallet"" and ""It would take much longer than a human lifetime."" I'm in that latter category. If we assume you know/figure out which one is the final checksum seed word, you would have 23!=2.6e22 possible combinations. I have no idea how many permutations a good script could reasonably test, but as a conservative check if you could test 10 billion per second it would still take 82 thousand years to try all the permutations (so we might expect you to get it in roughly half that time, 41 thousand years).

But maybe I'm way underestimating how fast scripts could check the seed phrases, or maybe I'm overlooking some feature of BIP39 that actually reduces the valid permutations. Regardless, many people are just not convinced by numbers on a page. Therefore, I'm putting my (little) money where my mouth is.

I've got a fresh 24-word wallet set up with 0.062 ETH (equivalent to $100 as of writing). The public address is 0xb6f420204511C7fE9Dd3DE14266a260e8f11aC37. It's yours for the taking if you can access it. The words in my seed phrase have been randomized in order and printed below. I'll plan to leave this wallet untouched until someone compromises it, or a year has passed and no one is interested. I should also mention that this wouldn't apply to a 12 word seed phrase. With the same estimation (11! permutations, 10 billion attempts per second,) that would only require 4 milliseconds to try every permutation for the 12 seed word phrase!

My 24 seed words in randomized order:

Happy de-crypting!


Updates ~10 hours later:

Wow, I didn't expect this to take off! Love all the engagement! So far the ETH is all still there (albeit worth slightly less USD than last time I checked...) As a PSA for those who don't know, you can check the holdings and transaction history of the wallet on etherscan.io by searching for the public key noted above  (and lots of other blockchains have similar portals.) So if you have any doubts, give it a check yourself.

One of the major themes of comments has been ""$100 ? That's not even worth it!"" And I totally agree! I suspect any amount of money is not worth it, short of the amount needed for a major decade-spanning quantum cryptography research campaign. Sadly, I'm not able to offer that right now, check back next bull run. But, I get it. Some people here win or lose thousands every time Powell picks up a microphone or Musk sits in front of a keyboard. Mostly lose these days. So considering all that, I'm adding another $900 and change to make it an even $1000. Hope I don't end up cross-posted on confidently incorrect!


And for comparison I'll add another test: you're also welcome to the $5 of ALGO in my newly created 12 word protected wallet. The public key for that wallet is CWGUNPGO6ESAZSU4WNNMKKCVPLA6VBWWQIRR4OOFE4XC4SYNLZLUT5DWPM. The 12 seed words in random order are:

8/3/23,Generation 3 Reddit Avatars Should Be Released Anytime Now,"Fellow redditors, small reminder,

As you know, maybe even own some, Reddit has their own NFT Avatars, which you can see in your Vaults where you store your precious Moons.

There is new subreddit opened just for talking and trading Reddit Collectible Avatars r/CollectibleAvatars . Check those out!

&#x200B;

So Reddit issued new contract on Polygon Network, where avatars are stored, so many collectors think  that new avatars collection is about to drop in few days. You can buy them in Avatar Shop from Reddit app or web page on your desktop.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/20csl4dtxhma1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5e91dc2fc179b6424c4f1740ed88c73d2767781c

Gen 1 and Gen 2 Avatars catched really good hype and value. Rather than that they are pretty cool.

Reddit released 40,000 avatars of 90 different designs created by about 30 artists.

Prices of the avatars on Reddit’s marketplace sold at fixed prices of $9.99, $24.99, $49.99, $74.99, or $99.99, and are currently all sold out.

Last July 2.5 million wallets have been created to buy this NFT Avatars. Not to shabby.

There are already a lot of leaks on Twitter, you can find those posts in linked subreddits up in the post.

There are also talks about bigger collections now, so more people could grab themselves an Avatar or few.

&#x200B;

What are your thoughts on Collectible Avatars on Reddit? Will you buy any?"
7/3/23,For those wondering what the loss really looks like,"It's hard to understand impermanent loss without an example.  With our MOON rising aggressively lately, allow me to explain what the impact has been for me as the #9 liquidity provider for ETH/MOON on SushiSwap.  

The experience reminds me of ""to the pain"" in The Princess Bride for those that get the reference.  I am fine with getting my butt kicked by impermanent loss because I am numb to such things thanks to 5 years of crypto thug life.  

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s1hs6ltfjema1.png?width=245&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e05349d7ac80c82ac92afa9a2ffabf79c5fd4dcf

I currently have half of my MOON total in the SushiSwap ETH/MOON liquidity pool and since I started a week or so ago **I am down over 5,000 of my MOON total in the pool**.  That doesn't mean I lost that many MOON.  It means I could.  But we don't withdraw.  We don't sell (until our target price).  We take the pain!  

There is more to impermanent loss.  This is meant to give you a sense of what the pain can look before you decide to jump in.  The drop is because MOON went up in price - a LOT - while ETH has been declining.  

So far the rewards have been a few hundred MOON, about 5 SUSHI.  Fees that providers also get from the pool remain tiny/negligible.

I will keep r/cc posted as this story progresses and provide more of the transactional details next time.  To my fellow liquidity providers - I salute you!"
8/3/23,About 3 years from now this sub would be filled of people regretting why they didn't but at XXXX.XX prices,"I'm also writing this for myself, I want to give myself a pat in the back for a job well done, and I also like saying ""I told you so"".

As of this writing BTC is sitting at 22k -67% down from previous ATH at 69k, while ETH is at 1.5k -68% down from previous ATH at 4.8k

8/3/23,New cryptos keep popping up even in the bear market - this can become a problem.,"As you all may know already. There exists currently thousands of crypto projects in this space, it is too easy to create one coin, a website and list it in a crypto tracker website like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko.

At the moment of writing, there are a total of 22,807 coins listed on CoinMarketCap. Three months ago, there were 22,080 cryptocurrencies and in the beginning of 2022, there were 16,372, this is an increase of nearly 40% in just a bit more than one year. **Even during this winter**.

These numbers are incredibly high, there's no way to keep up-to-date about which projects are good out of the new ones. However, we all know that most of them are dead projects. According to Statista, discounting this *dead* projects, there are nearly 9000 active cryptocurrencies at the moment listed on CoinMarketCap.

&#x200B;

[Number of cryptocurrencies from 2013 to February 2023 - Source: Statista](https://preview.redd.it/ntlcnh3rghma1.png?width=714&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3ad4f248c677e580b5b03a3d5e53e8b73315fb10)

So even in this bear market, new projects are emerging. Actually, according to [this article](https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/how-many-cryptocurrencies-failed) from CoinGecko, **almost 950 cryptocurrencies listed each year end up failing** (on average from 2018 to 2022).

So I cannot imagine how many projects will come up on the next bull run. Creating a coin is becoming easier. So now, more than ever, please guys **DYOR**. We might need to cleanse this industry.

Do you think this is a big problem? Is this slowing down adoption?

TL;DR. While the bear market may have slowed down some aspects of the crypto space, it hasn't prevented new projects from popping up. Remember to DYOR."

8/3/23,Papal FOMO: Pope Francis converts the Catholic Church's Gold Reserves into Solana (SOL),"Vatican City - In a surprise move, Pope Francis announced today that he has converted all of the Catholic Church's gold reserves into Solana (SOL) cryptocurrency. This marks a significant shift in the Church's financial strategy and is sure to raise eyebrows in the world of traditional finance.

The announcement was made during a press conference at the Vatican, where the Pope proudly declared, ""We are entering a new era of financial technology, and we want to be at the forefront of it. That's why we've put all of our gold into this Solana thing!""

The exact value of the Church's investment has not been disclosed, but it is believed to be in the billions of dollars. The move has been met with mixed reactions from the financial community, with some experts applauding the Church's forward-thinking approach, while others have expressed concern about Pope Francis not investing in Dogecoin (DOGE) instead."
8/3/23,Chinas CBDC will be linked to you Digital ID and the money will have an expiration date. Another case where Crypto will be seen as the way better alternative to CBDCs.,"A CBDC, a Central Bank Digital Currency, is a digital currency that will be issued by a central bank, the banknotes there can be “printed“ with literally no costs whatsoever, opposing to the printing costs of fiat. It would basically give governments and especially banks a lot more power as they could froze your assets whenever wanted and to track literally all activity of you.

China is even coming up with a new decision here, the money on your account could have an expiration date according to Bitcoinist and Bitcoin Magazine. Even if not, China would absolutely have the capability to impose that any time.

Already in countries like Nigeria where the eNaira released, they even imposed a withdrawal limit on ATMs but still people did not use their CBDC but instead way more used Crypto. The usage of Crypto in Nigeria has sky-rocketed in Nigeria meanwhile.

Which could makes us expect that any CBDC coming out will face some rejection by the people, then the government will impose stricter laws ultimately sending their people to the alternative: Crypto."
8/3/23,Brave Browser / BAT is an example of why a great project doesn't always lead to great returns,"Anyone on here who hasn't used Brave should try it. There was a post on here about Brave blocking Youtube Ads, but it does so much more. In addition it blocks most website prompts, like asking you to turn off ad block, or on mobile, they're adding a feature to stop websites prompting you to open their content on their app. 

These features ad up on the browsing experience, they're doing a great job of removing many of the annoying aspects of modern day browsing, but BAT continues to slide towards irrelevance. Today, it's ranked 115 on Coingecko, after being a top 50 coin a few years back. 

https://www.bravebat.info/brave_initiated_bat_purchase

Brave purchases BAT using advertiser revenue to give users their token. They're buying these on the open market and look at the trend. After looking like they'd need to buy and re-distribute millions of BAT a month, they've cratered to a multi-year low in USD. Without this buy pressure, BAT has become less and less valuable.

User growth has stalled around 55 million monthly users, though daily users continues to tick up, now over 20 million a day. What's crazy though is that they're doing like $250k in ad buys for 20 million users a month. That's like a penny a month per user, and shows an inability to convert a decent user base into revenue.

Right now the biggest headwind for BAT is global regulations. After 6 years, they have only 2, not great custodians. Choosing between Uphold (which sucks) and Gemini (which just screwed a bunch of users in their earn program) is crap. Coinbase and Kraken should be options by now. People in developing countries should have options. Right now Brave removed their custodial partners, and those users are on the verge of losing their earned BAT forever.

Web3 and applications like BAT are going to eventually succeed, but the hurdles are immense, and converting these wonderful ideas into revenue streams that justify the token is lacking in the space. The early 00's was full of great ideas and promises that were never realized. I would advise anyone to be cautious investing into use cases just yet. A ton of these are going to fail before the Amazons and the Googles show themselves. We gotta get through the AOL, Netscape, Yahoo phase of Web3 first."

8/3/23,How much are you ACTUALLY earning on your staked tokens?,"I've noticed some very misinformed comments (shock!) in the past few months here regarding rates of return on staked POS tokens.  It is a hard fact of life that what you think you might be earning can be far from reality.  You see, most POS chains pay you staking rewards with **newly-printed** tokens, which dilute the overall supply, which means that you are not earning the headline interest rate.  Some POS chains are worse than others.  Here is a little chart showing the **real return** on your investment versus the advertised/headline/nominal rate, listed from worst to best.

&#x200B;

|Project|Nominal Rate|Inflation|*Real Rate*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Tezos|6.0 %|4.7 %|**1.3 %**|
|Cardano|3.8|2.1|**1.7**|
|Solana|7.5|5.3|**2.0**|
|Tron|4.5|2.0|**2.5**|
|Elrond|8.3|5.2|**2.9**|
|Polygon|4.7|1.8|**2.9**|
|Dash|5.8|2.4|**3.3**|
|Graph|7.3|3.0|**4.3**|
|Ethereum|5.7|0.5\*|**5.1**|
|Cosmos|23.2|15.6|**6.6**|
|Polkadot|15.1|7.4|**7.1**|

\*Ethereum has had negative inflation (i.e., deflationary) since January 16, 2023   
(Sources: [staked.us/yields](https://staked.us/yields) and [ultrasound.money](https://ultrasound.money))

As can be seen, Tezos has the worst real staking return, and Cardano has the 2nd worst.  Currently, Polkadot has the best real return.  Cosmos comes in at 2nd best.  And Ethereum comes in at 3rd best.  Note that Cosmos and Polkadot have very high inflation, so if you own these tokens and aren't staking them, you are doing something wrong.  Also note that Ethereum has very low (i.e., currently negative) inflation, so holding ETH without staking is just fine, and you are earning a real return just by holding it.  Of course, staking ETH is even better if you want a higher return."
8/3/23,Grayscale Appears To Win Opening Salvo in Bitcoin ETF Case vs SEC,
8/3/23,"After reading this, will you say we are not early?","To be brief, I live in a country with an annual inflation rate of 100%. You might expect everyone to buy USD to combat inflation, right? Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There are limits, and most people can't buy it. Even if they can, they're only allowed to purchase $200 per month.

As a freelance artist who works online, I earn USD. However, if I transfer $1,000 to my bank account, I'll only end up with $450 or less due to the 43% conversion rate (taxes would make that number anywhere between 55% to 70%). What's worse, I'm not permitted to buy USD afterward and must use my country's currency.

So, what do I do? I say screw the government and banks. I use everything I earn to buy crypto and never send it to my bank. I save in stable coins and invest the rest. It's risky, but it's better than dealing with a currency no one wants and 100% inflation.

Honestly, if it weren't for crypto, I'd be in a tough spot. I'm just one of many people worldwide in a similar situation. Crypto has been the solution to my main problem, and if CBDC ever becomes available here, demand for crypto will soar exponentially.

Sure, I could acquire USD in other ways, like P2P transactions via offshore banks. But that option carries more risk than holding crypto.  Getting fiat currency isn't that difficult for me. I can acquire it through 2P2 transactions. Perhaps in the future, people will start accepting crypto as a payment method more frequently. But for now, it still works perfectly fine for me."

It also appears that in addition to the free drops we might also get Gen 3 since some artist names have been found.

So we don't know if Gen 3 will drop or just the free starter packs as reddit is calling the collection of 2 million each.

Gen 2 dropped on a Thursday last time which would be tomorrow but since Reddit still hasn't made an announcement I don't know how likely it is.

So this is all speculation at the moment but it's exciting."
8/3/23,New lows are coming. Do you have a plan?,"A US recession is looming. 100% of the time these keys indicators happen, the US falls into a recession. You could argue a global recession will follow or is already happening. 

1. Food at home in US at CPI at 6% year over year. It’s at 13%. 

2. Real Yield Curve inverted. Most inverted since the 1980’s. 

3. US Dollar up 20% over a 52 week period. Happened in May and August. 

-Source Greg Weldon, CEO of Weldon Financials on Real Vision. 

All of these have happened in the last 6 months. This is not a FUD post, this is a wake up call to anyone who doesn’t have a strategy or plan. If you plan is to DCA regardless then disregard this recession, if you are a trader, then this is important. 

Personally, I’m a long term investor. I have no problem watching the market tank. I’m saving to buy more when this hits the fan. What is your plan?"
8/3/23,"Even in a Bear Market the total address count of BTC, ETH and LTC has been sky-rocketing.

For even more such metrics you can check up some of my previous posts. If there has been a bull market for fundamentals, we should just look on the simplest of all: Total Addresses.

While one address does not necessarily depict one user on the blockchain as one person can can have any many crypto addresses as wanted, it can still be seen as a good aggregate for increasing users or even just increase in blockchain usage.

This chart shows just how the amount of Total Addresses for BTC, ETH and even LTC has been taking off and that even in a bear market where all BTC, ETH and LTC broke the milestone of 1 billion addresses each which is just huge. Surprisingly, LTC is at the top with nearly 1.2B followed by ETH and BTC.

Here we can also see the growth of those addresses per Crypto and LTC is leading that by a far margin while it once actually was below both on growth during the start of the bull run.

This all just happens to show once again how irrelevant even this bear market was for the actual utility of Crypto which just kept increasing even during the peaks of the bear market. That adoption and development will be the foundations of the next bull run."

I think we could all use some good news in our lives. Let’s use to comment section below to discuss some of the good things that are happening in crypto and spread some hopium on this very red day. 

I’ll update the list of good news in this post as people comment. 

I’ll start by listing 3. 

- The MOON price hitting .25USD again, and the addition of the liquidity pool. 

- Kraken starting its own bank! 

- Gen 3 avatars coming soon! 

Let’s try to remain positive and spread some good news!

Additional positives: 

- The bear market forces developers to focus on quality projects and use cases.

- Grayscale ETF might be approved soon!

- Litecoin halving in 147 days!

- Bitcoin halving in 386 days!

- Total Market Cap still close to 1 trillion in the bear market!

- Moon Snapshot in 6 days! 🌕

- The Ripple/Xrp case is looking good!

However, if Reddit introduces a new coin for a new community or the market cap of the other two goes up, would you consider engaging more often with those subreddits? I haven’t considered owning a stash of bricks or donuts but after seeing the potential, I might just have to. Right now, I imagine a lot of users here didn’t realize about the other subreddits having their own crypto which I hope more people are aware now."

8/3/23,What cryptos will die?,"When I joined back in November 2021 (horrible time I know) alot of people were saying that 90 percent of all crypto dies in a bear market.

Well were here and been here for a while now...And a lot of crypto has lost upwards of 90 percent of its value. Coins that come to mind that I know are dead are Luna classic, and ftx token.

I guess the others will be determined dead in hindsight. As defined by you guys some of these coins will die by not regaining their value which will only be determined in the next bull season.

Coins that lost a lot of value that come to mind are CRO, ONE and Doge.

With regulations looming Busd is getting gone as well.

I believe CRO depends on regulations as well and their ability to bring the benefits of the card back which is doubtful. ONE suffered the hack and has been limping since. Doge is losing elons influence for a form of payment on Twitter possibly.

Almost forgot about shitcoin Solana, thoughts on that hot mess?

I believe atom and it's ecosystem will be fine outside of juno, I think dot will be alright as well. LRC will probably come back as well due to tech and the apes.

My question is what's crypto are you confident is dead and not to return or inversely what crypto are you confident will come back?

Please don't say the obligatory BTC. We all should believe it will never die or we wouldn't be here."

8/3/23,Impermanent Loss and the math behind Liquidity Pools explained,"Since the rewards for the Moon/ETH liquidity pool went live I’ve seen many people struggling to understand the financial risks of joining a liquidity pool and even people who don’t know about impermanent loss. I’m absolutely no expert and would appreciate it if someone corrects me if I made an error somewhere, but nevertheless I would like to try and explain the math behind liquidity pools and what impermanent loss is.

# Stats we start with on February 26th when the rewards for the Liquidity Pool went live:

* You join with a $16,000 stack
* Moons $0.19 from February 26th when Liquidity Pool (LP) rewards went live
* ETH $1,600 from February 26th when Liquidity Pool (LP) rewards went live
* Moons experienced a 22% gain from February 26th till now
* ETH experienced a 3% loss from February 26th till now

# Example 1: You join the LP with $16,000 worth of ETH on February 26th

You have 10 ETH worth $16,000 and you want to join the Moons/ETH LP. A LP always balances both sides of the book so the $ value of each holding is exactly the same. So in this case to be able to join you basically sell half your stack of ETH for Moons to be able to join:

You hold at the start, 26th of February, 5 ETH worth $8,000 (5 \* $1,600) and 42,105 Moons worth $8,000 (42,105 \* $0.19).

Meanwhile Moons have increased in price with about 22% while ETH decreased in price with about 3% over the last 10 days. This changed your stack to:

37,544 Moons worth $8,702 (37,544 \* $0.2318). The $0.2318 comes from the 22% increase in price since February 26th when Moons were $0.19.

5.607 ETH worth $8,702 (5.607 \* $1,552). The $1,552 comes from the 3% decrease in price since February 26th when ETH was $1,600.

&#x200B;

Your total holdings are now $8,702 in Moons + $8,702 in ETH = **$17,404 a 8.775% increase from your original value of $16,000 after joining the LP.**

If you just held on to your 10 ETH you would have had 10 \* $1,552 = **$15,520 a 3% decrease from your original value of $16,000 if you didn't join the LP.**

**Joining the LP with ETH compared to holding your ETH has increased your value with $1,884 ($17,404 - $15,520) which equates to a portfolio increase of 12.14%**

# Example 2: You join the LP with $16,000 worth of Moons on February 26th

You have 84,210 Moons worth $16,000 and you want to join the Moons/ETH LP. A LP always balances both sides of the book so the $ value of each holding is exactly the same. So in this case to be able to join you basically sell half your stack of Moons for ETH to be able to join:

You hold at the start, 26th of February, 5 ETH worth $8,000 (5 \* $1,600) and 42,105 Moons worth $8,000 (42,105 \* $0.19).

Meanwhile Moons have increased in price with about 22% while ETH decreased in price with about 3% over the last 10 days. This changed your stack to:

37,544 Moons worth $8,702 (37,544 \* $0.2318). The $0.2318 comes from the 22% increase in price since February 26th when Moons were $0.19.

5.607 ETH worth $8,702 (5.607 \* $1,552). The $1,552 comes from the 3% decrease in price since February 26th when ETH was $1,600.

&#x200B;

Your total holdings are now $8,702 in Moons + $8,702 in ETH = **$17,404 a 8.775% increase from your original value of $16,000 after joining the LP.**

If you just held on to your 84,210 Moons you would have had 84,210 \* $0.2318 = **$19,520 a 22% increase from your original value of $16,000 if you didn't join the LP.**

**Joining the LP with Moons compared to holding your Moons has decreased your value with $2,116 ($17,404 - $19,520) which equates to a portfolio decrease of 10.84%**

# Example 3: Impermanent Loss explained

But what if you already had 42,105 Moons worth $8,000 and 5 ETH worth $8,000 to start with on February 26th and you joined the LP without having to swap Moons for ETH or vice versa? That’s how we will be able to explain and calculate the impermanent loss you would be experiencing.

As mentioned before with the price increase of 22% for Moons and a price decrease of 3% for ETH since February 26th you would hold these amounts in the LP:

37,544 Moons worth $8,702 (37,544 \* $0.2318). The $0.2318 comes from the 22% increase in price since February 26th when Moons were $0.19.

5.607 ETH worth $8,702 (5.607 \* $1,552). The $1,552 comes from the 3% decrease in price since February 26th when ETH was $1,600.

Your total holdings in the LP are now $8,702 in Moons + $8,702 in ETH = $17,404 a 8.775% increase from your original value of $16,000

&#x200B;

To be able to see what your impermanent loss would be you compare these numbers to ‘what if I just held?’. Let’s see those numbers:

42,105 Moons worth $9,760 (42,105 \* $0.2318). The $0.2318 comes from the 22% increase in price since February 26th when Moons were $0.19.

5 ETH worth $7,760 (5 \* $1,552). The $1,552 comes from the 3% decrease in price since February 26th when ETH was $1,600.

Your total holdings if you just held would have been $9,760 in Moons + $7,760 in ETH = $17,520

&#x200B;

**Just holding versus joining the LP would have netted you $116 more. The $116 is your impermanent loss, or 0.65%.**

**But the fun thing about joining a LP are the rewards. So as long as your LP rewards within those 10 days since it went live exceeded $116 in value, you would still have made more by being in the LP compared to just holding.**

I hope this piece of information has helped some of you understand how liquidity pools work and the maths behind it. Not only do you have to consider if you join with a stack of Moons or ETH, but also important is to try and solve if the rewards from the liquidity pool outweigh the impermanent loss you are going to experience. **Because unless Moons and ETH mimic their exact price action, you will be experiencing impermanent loss.**"
8/3/23,"Exactly 17 months ago, thieves tried to steal a Bitcoin ATM. The journalist reporting it said he did not know Bitcoin ATMs were a thing.","Today marks the 17-month anniversary of one of the most prominent we-are-early indicators: a group of bad actors tried to steal a Bitcoin ATM. The case happened in the NYC Bay Area, precisley from a Silicon Valley liquor store.

They used a cord and tied the ATM to a van, removing it from the store:

[Source: NBC](https://preview.redd.it/k8pl20l9rjma1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1b795ce4b504ac6096e4701594001a4237f9f3be)

The funny thing is that the news piece actually is somewhat informative. The journalist states that he did not know that Bitcoin ATMs were a thing. In addition, an interviewee explained that you couldn't possibly steal BTC from the ATMs, only hackers could do so! [You can watch the interview yourself](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/thieves-break-into-silicon-valley-liquor-store-to-steal-bitcoin-atm/2677196/)! The price of Bitcoin was $55,000 at the time (do I miss those times...). 

This news piece often comes to my mind when discussing if we're early or not. It's a matter or perspective, I'd say. We're earlier than people jumping in in the next run, but late if compared to those who came in before us.

As for the tech, we're definitely early. I think it will take at least a decade before we can say we're not that early."

I’ve never used Brave, but from reading the post I feel like I understand it pretty well. Just not entirely sure why everyone chose this week to talk about it. Again though, I do fear this has to do with bots pushing post."

Don't invest more than you can afford to lose just because you feel like your investment isn't significant enough.

It's common to feel the urge to invest more to avoid missing out on gains (aka FOMO), but it's important to prioritize your financial stability. Many of us can only afford to invest small amounts and that's okay.

8/3/23,Did anyone else majorly mess up when Bitcoin got down to 8k a couple years ago?,"I kick myself nearly everyday for this and want to see if I’m the only one. When Bitcoin dropped like a rock sometime during the pandemic and hit 8k I decided to purchase 3/4 of a coin. I figured it would make for a good investment and could pay off at least a little bit in the future.








Well during this time I was also heavily struggling with substance abuse and being locked in at home only made that easier to justify. I’m sure you can see where this is going. Before Bitcoin even rose back to 10k I had spent all but $500 worth of my Bitcoin on substances. 







Nearly everyday I think about how mad I am at myself for doing this. If I had only chosen to get sober sooner I would’ve still had that coin when it was in the 60k range and could’ve used it for so much more. Am I the only one who fucked up this hard over something so fucking lame? 









Just as a side note, I didn’t list the date ranges because I genuinely can’t remember the date ranges, it was a hazy time so forgive the minor missing info."
8/3/23,Would you still be obsessed with BTC if it only averaged about a 10% increase per year?,"As we know, majority of crypto investors are here to make money, and quick money. But let's say it's 20 years in the future and BTC is now only doing an average gain of about 10%. However it's utility is still strong. Would you still be compelled to try to accumulate as much BTC as you can, would you feel the need to have a big chunk of it in your portfolio for the sake of it's utility? Or would you not care as much and try to chase other new coins that do 100x, yet are very risky.

IMO I don't think BTC can indefinitely rise 100% on average each year, even with each halving. It will eventually reach a point where the gains are ""normal"" to other investments. So by then, are people really gonna be super excited to hodl BTC?

Edit: This 10% is not **guaranteed** but has just shown an average over time now. Just like if you take the average since 2009, BTC has shown incredible returns, over 100% I believe and because of that I think people look at BTC as a ticket to becoming very wealthy. But seeing the return slow down with it potentially going lower than 10% would you still be obsessed to accumulate or would you look into higher paying coins but more risky?"
8/3/23,What's next after the FEDs raise rates higher than expected?,"We all saw the news today, Jerome Powel being hawkish and indicating that rates will be higher than anticipated on the next round of hikes.

Overall, the entire market took that negatively. BTC dropped and bounced back as expected but I'm not too convinced that this is the end, rather the beginning.

How will the next rate hike of 50 or higher basis points affect the crypto world? The fear index is real and I don't think it will be going anywhere anytime soon.

I DCA in monthly and hopefully I catch some good red dildos in the next few months.

What is your strategy? Do you folks have any plans for when BTC goes sub 16k again, very possible.

—

Whilst many general categorisations can and have been made between groups of people throughout history (I’m not talking pejoratively), one I have always liked is the distinction between those who are Pioneers and those who are Settlers

Neither is better or worse than the other. Pioneers courageously explore. Settlers carefully build. Some like to travel the world, and some like to build a permanent abode and enjoy the consistent rhythms of daily life. In fact, we will move back and forth between these categories at different stages of our lives

There is no doubt blockchain technology is pioneering infrastructure, which will become as commonplace as the internet before it. What is being pioneered by the few now will be settled in by the masses soon. Unimaginable adoption and utility will come, and faster than expected. Some legacy systems will jump in the river, and some will watch the river flow around them. Adapt or die

Crypto is still such a nascent environment. Influencers, bros, megalomaniacal narcissistic CEOs, all manner of growing pains. However, if you understand what you are invested in, and are not over-invested, the bear becomes a builders’ blessing and you are able to cut through the noise. We have to pioneer and settle simultaneously

Like those who explored new worlds and walked beyond the boundaries of their present-day maps, we are riding the new wave into the shores of a digital and technological revolution that will turn the world upside down. The biggest and smartest banks and businesses know it. They couldn’t ignore it, they couldn’t destroy it, so now they’re running towards it

True, hard money in Bitcoin, software platforms with smart contract capabilities, utility tokens earning revenue from real world usage and application. This revolution cuts out the middle man and has been dubbed the “Ownership Economy”. We can all own the building blocks of this coming age

Let’s be honest, we’re here for the tech and for the money. That’s the point of this so-called Ownership Economy. We don’t simply hold supply to say we’re a “tokenised fan” of a project; we own protocols and earn revenue from them. We hold digital gold, we earn yield on the next iterations of operating systems, we are paid to secure decentralised networks

Blockchain adoption is inevitable. So with uniform position sizing, wise project diversification, and most importantly patience, the Pioneer has an advantage. Once this space is settled by the masses, many of the biggest opportunities are lost

The greatest threat to Pioneers with long-term horizons during lacklustre markets is creeping boredom. It is important for us all to remind ourselves that being focused, courageous and patient Pioneers is the best way we can work towards realising a future as free and secure Settlers

TL;DR - Blockchain and crypto is the next age of technological innovation and societal revolution. I want to be courageous in this frontier now, so that my family and their children can enjoy a better quality of life than I had. I want to pioneer, so that one day we can all settle together, and enjoy the fruits of what we had the vision to build"

8/3/23,"First crypto was used to buy pizza, now it's being used to find pulsars and black holes","Crypto can do lots of things. It can bull and bear, moon and dip, and even obtain food to dip in sauce. But did you know it can also help us find new pulsars and astronomical objects?

Some exciting news came out of the [Einstein @ home project today](https://einsteinathome.org/content/news-about-einsteinhome-searches-radio-and-gamma-ray-pulsars), which is a volunteer research project to find pulsars and other astronomical objects using data from LIGO and other data collection sources. To do this, they use the computers of volunteers to crunch the data. To date, they have discovered 80 new pulsars and identified several *billion* more data points which need further analysis.

The cool thing about this? Einstein @ home is one of about a dozen projects which is incentivized by /r/Gridcoin. Instead of paying miners to just calculate hashes, Gridcoin pays miners to contribute their processing power to science projects, including to Einstein @ home, Alzheimer's research, and more all in a decentralized, automated manner. And it's been doing this since 2013, making it one of the longer-lived cryptos out there that still has an active development team and user base.

I love all the cool things crypto can do. Cool to be here with y'all. Excited to see what it does next, after it's done exploring the universe, of course."

8/3/23,How Richard Heart Took From his followers and supporters and others more than half a BILLION USD in the CRAZIEST way ever.,"At this point, you all know who Richard Heart is. A self-proclaimed Crypto expert and a cocky narcissist, an exhibitionist who likes to show off and crave for attention. Richard created Hex and immediately it became a cult, people followed him blindly as he promised them enormous returns on their investments and great wealth.

 In late 2022 Heart and HEX became the subject of an SEC investigation.  

 HEX is known more for its social media network than any actual utility, offering network members/token holders interest returns of between 3.69% and 369%. Rewards are greater for those who “stake” the highest percentage of their HEX holdings for the longest time, with claims the final payout (after 15 years) would be even larger if the HEX token’s market value increases. 

Yes, people are ""staking"" their tokens for 15 years with the expectation of otherwordly profits. Crazy right? This is only the introduction the craziest part has yet to come.

Richard had promised people a new project, a new token release. A Network named PulseChain and their native token will be PLS. Richard even said:  
*“Let me make a better version of Ethereum”.*  
This will be **PulseChain (PLS)**. 

&#x200B;

Well well now is the fun part, Richard had the brilliant idea for the ""benefit""(obviously sarcasm) of his investors, supporters, and followers to create the so-called: SACRIFICE PHASE

What is the Sacrifice phase? This is what Richard told them:  The sacrifice phase means that at this point you can sacrifice all kinds of different tokens to receive sacrifice points. The number of sacrifice points you receive will be a 1:1 ratio to the amount of Pulse tokens you will get when the PulseChain network goes online.  The goal of sacrificing is to get as high in the rankings as possible.  
This depends on the amount of USD your crypto is worth at the time you offer it.  
*More USD = more PLS.* 

And by the sacrifice he meant people sending their tokens to him for free.

### Total sacrificed during the ranking phase

# $670,007,371

For example, the top wallet ""sacrificed""  $29,562,449 = CRAZY

How was Richard feeling about all of this and what he told to these people?

BY SACRIFICING YOUR CRYPTO YOU DO NOT BUY PLSX. YOU CAN GIVE YOUR CRYPTO AWAY, SACRIFICE IT AS A POLITICAL STATEMENT. ONCE YOU HAVE DONE THAT YOU DO NOT OWN IT ANYMORE. NEVER EXPECT PROFIT FROM THE WORK OF OTHERS. WHOEVER OWNS YOUR CRYPTO AFTER YOU SACRIFICED IT DOES NOT WORK FOR YOU.  


What a nice guy right?  and as for a dessert here it's his disclaimer.

&#x200B;

 **Disclaimer** You are sacrificing to prove how strongly you believe in the right of human assembly. You must have no expectation of profit from the work of others. The set of people who have sacrificed to show their commitment to this political statement makes a great set of people to airdrop free things to. These Sacrifice Points are not meant to have any monetary value. Remember, you're not buying anything, the world is just noticing you are amongst a group of people that sacrificed to make a political statement. Some countries tax their citizens when they receive things of value. PLSX is designed to start with no value, which is ideal. Consult your own legal and financial professionals, as nothing written here should be considered professional advice. The only thing we know of set to be airdropped for free to this political group so far is PulseX (PLSX.) If we hear about other cool things, we'll let you know. 

&#x200B;

This is how Richard took from them $670,007,371 and they are happy, they still believe in him and still live in hopium.

For me personally, this is the CRAZIEST story ever in crypto, so many people getting manipulated to hand over their crypto, to hand over their money and future."
8/3/23,Bitcoin halving will be less than a year away at the end of this month! Is this good for the bitcoin network?,"Can’t believe it’s already almost the next halving, at least it’s almost under a year away. Most halvings usually mean price appreciation, which is what we want, but is the next one going to be bad for the bitcoin network?

It’s no surprise to anyone that the cost of energy has gone crazy in the past year and I don’t see it coming down. With the amount of rewards being cut in half, will miners even bother to mine anymore? Seems like a lot of miners have been selling their rewards to cover the costs just to mine bitcoin, when those rewards get cut in half, will it even be profitable?

TLDR will bitcoin mining even be profitable after the next halving?"

8/3/23,How a XRP settlement with the SEC would affect the Crypto market," If Ripple Labs and the SEC reach a settlement agreement in the XRP lawsuit, it could have a significant impact on the crypto market. 

Here are some potential affects i can think of:

&#x200B;

1. XRP price could surge: If the SEC drops the lawsuit or reaches a settlement agreement that does not impose significant restrictions on Ripple Labs, XRP's price could experience a significant boost. The uncertainty around the lawsuit has weighed heavily on the XRP price, and resolving the issue could alleviate this pressure.
2. Ripple Labs could face financial penalties: In the event that Ripple Labs settles with the SEC, it could face financial penalties that could hurt its bottom line. However, Ripple Labs has already stated that it is prepared to pay these penalties, so it is unlikely that this would significantly impact its long-term prospects.
3. Regulatory clarity for other cryptocurrencies: A settlement in the XRP lawsuit could provide regulatory clarity for other cryptocurrencies. The SEC has been scrutinizing the crypto industry, and resolving the XRP lawsuit could set a precedent for how the agency views other digital assets.

Resolving the lawsuit could alleviate uncertainty and provide regulatory clarity for the broader crypto industry. 

What do you guys think would the be outcome if there is a settlement?"

For example, my first crypto was a certain controversial moon-themed meme-coin I won’t name. At the time, I thought i was invested in the new-bitcoin with no uncertainty or doubt. Now, two years later it makes up 12% of my portfolio and I honestly view it as a joke and write-off.

I can’t have been the only one to have such a drastic change on their view of their first crypto. Alternatively, if you made good choices at the start, what were they? (and congrats for doing better than I did!)"

The analysis accounted for all tokens launched on BNB and ETH chains. The majority of the tokens had no traction, so they analyzed those who had more than 10 swaps in the first week of launch. This totaled 40,521 new tokens. Of these, **9,902** had characteristics of pump and dumps:

Hundreds of victims bought the token on that DEX, allowing the price to rise quickly in a matter of hours. However, **within the same day of launch, the creator sold off all of his tokens**, leaving buyers holding the bag. Overall, the perpetrator made just under $20,000.

445 individuals or groups were solely responsible for 2,376 tokens with pump and dump characteristics. It seems that these bad actors chose this as a profession. Stay aware everyone, because when the run starts we'll see an increase in offer of such miraculous coins."

But what now, obviously there is risk at play, but at what point would you say is the time to pull back on these actions and get your MOONs / ETH back?

8/3/23,Reflecting on the First 2 Years of SafeMoon: A Rollercoaster Ride for Investors,"Hey r/CC!

 **Today marks the 2-year anniversary of the launch of SafeMoon**, it's time to reflect on the ups and downs of this cryptocurrency journey. SafeMoon's inception was met with a lot of excitement, and it quickly gained popularity among investors. However, the ride has been anything but smooth since then. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8vgcbglzmhma1.jpg?width=745&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0249709cc73040f40498ade329adcc9d0a772418

 When Safemoon first launched in March 2021, it gained a lot of attention and hype within the crypto community. Its unique tokenomics, which included a 10% transaction fee, where 5% was burned and 5% was distributed to existing holders, attracted many investors looking for the next big thing in the crypto market. The team behind Safemoon also launched an aggressive marketing campaign, which included influencer endorsements and social media promotions - The endorsements by celebrities and influencers like rapper Lil Yachty, YouTuber KEEMSTAR, and boxer Jake Paul further popularized the project - As a result, the token's price surged in the first month, reaching an all-time high of $0.00001057 on April 20, 2021.  

As of March 2023, SafeMoon, a cryptocurrency that became popular in 2021, has seen a decline in value and faced numerous controversies. SafeMoon's value dropped around 85 percent in a few months, leading to two groups of investors launching class actions lawsuits against the company and its celebrity promoters, accusing it of ""pump and dump"" fraud. SafeMoon also received criticism from independent researcher Coffeezilla, who accused the company's employees of misappropriating **millions** of dollars. Despite this, a few investors remain optimistic about the company, and its CEO, John Karony, has unveiled a project called Operation Phoenix that investors hope will turn the project around.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yv7ok009nhma1.jpg?width=1020&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=23d19629cdf2f3d8a47196505f026a202ef04ee7

Despite the controversies, SafeMoon's story remains a cautionary tale for people interested in investing in cryptocurrencies and more complex DeFi products. Many investors are interested in seeing how the lawsuits against the company and its celebrity promoters will play out, as it could send a strong signal to influencers who engage in ""pump and dump"" schemes without fear of repercussions. 

SafeMoon's CEO, John Karony, had described SafeMoon's mission as that of a ""tech"" company , emphasizing his plans to bring the future to the present. He also introduced Operation Phoenix, which aims to bring wind turbines to single households in Africa, as part of a combination of multiple innovations combined into a single SafeMoon ecosystem. The plan for the wind turbines and how they will generate revenue for the company and users is unclear. Karony also mentioned integrating the turbines with a planned metaverse game in a video posted in January 2023.

Two years later, SafeMoon is still struggling to gain traction and is considered by many to be a dying project. Despite the efforts of its community, SafeMoon has failed to live up to its initial hype, and many early investors have lost faith in the project. While some die-hard fans still believe that SafeMoon has the potential to turn things around, others are more pessimistic and believe that it's only a matter of time before the project is declared dead. At this point, it's difficult to say exactly how long SafeMoon has left, but the odds are certainly stacked against it.

8/3/23,What goal are you trying to reach with Crypto?,"Everyone here has some idea of what they want to do once they reach their goal, whether it be take some profits and keep the rest, or sell everything and leave crypto forever, or just never take profits, haha.

Could be financial freedom, or a house, or something not as big but one that's mroe realistic than others in this market. I think financial freedom with Crypto seems a little too hard with the market needing much more capital than before to make money from your investments, but it's possible of course. 


Those who got in Bitcoin early may have already achieved their goal, though it's not as easy anymore so more people opt for alts and memecoins.

8/3/23,Make sure to actually stake your liquidity in the Moon/Eth pool (PSA - Advice),"After the CCIP-051 Moon rewards went live on the Moon/Eth pool on the SushiSwap, as many of you did, I also went to ""provide liquidity"" (not much, barely 50$ worth it, yet around \~1/4 of my moons), but after nearly two days, I noticed that I hadn't gained any rewards at all.

The reason was one: I was a dmb@ss and I hadn't actually added the liquidity pool (LP) token into the pool.

You see, I did as I understood it. Went to swap some Moons for Ethereum and then I added the Ethereum and the Moon into one thing. Yet, this is not enough. That was just half the work needed. I had just made the new token out of the combination of the two coins.

Yet, this new token (the LP ) needs to be deposited / staked into the pool together with the other users' (providers') LP tokens.

Thus, my liquidity was sitting in the blockchain doing nothing, unstaked.

**So how can you check that you have indeed added your LP token into the pool?**

# Method 1 (via [Sushi.com](https://sushi.com/))

Checking your rewards. If you haven't acrued any rewards after a day or two, you probably haven't added any LP token... On the page of the Pool (MOON-WETH - Classic Pool - 0.30%, [https://www.sushi.com/earn/arb-nova:0xd6c821b282531868721b41badca1f1ce471f43c5](https://www.sushi.com/earn/arb-nova:0xd6c821b282531868721b41badca1f1ce471f43c5)), when your wallet is connected, check the section in right column with the title ""My Rewards"". Dpending on the APR, your size of the intended for liquidity coins (actually the percentage of the pool you hold) and time, you should see some Sushi and Moons counting upwards.

# Method 2 (via [Sushi.com](https://sushi.com/))

On the page of the Pool (as above), when your wallet is connected, check the section in right column with the title ""My Position"".

You should have value in the Staked Position.

My ""idle"" liquidity was in the unstaked position....

# Method 3 (via Wallet / Metamask)

Add the SushiSwap LP Token in your Metamask and if the SLP is 0, you have indeed added the token into the pool. (Step by Step for PC:

1. Click on Metamask, make sure Arbitrum Nova is selected as the network.
2. On the ""Assets"" tab, scroll down and click the ""Import tokens"" underneath the ""Don't see your token?""
3. In the ""Token contract address"" enter ""0xd6c821b282531868721b41badca1f1ce471f43c5"" \[you can check it in the explorer for the nova-arbitrum {[https://nova-explorer.arbitrum.io/token/0xD6C821b282531868721b41BAdca1F1ce471f43C5/token-transfers](https://nova-explorer.arbitrum.io/token/0xD6C821b282531868721b41BAdca1F1ce471f43C5/token-transfers)} \] and click the ""Add custom token"" button.)

# tl;dr

***If you intended on ""adding liquidity"" in the pool, make sure you actually have staked the liquidity token IN the pool.***

*(The initial post was taken down cause the moon posts were above the limit, but after some great comments that passed through, I desided I should post it to help maybe another user or two. Hopefully I am / was the only one that didn't completed the whole ""add liquidity"" thing.)*  


*Edit 1: This is by no means a post to promote staking, liquidity of moons, as yes there is a possibility (or many) of impermanent losses, as others have noted in many other recent posts. It is just my advice from my mistake (for what this is worth it to anyone or to you) that if you have desided you want to stake and thus add liquidity in this pool, any other like the Moon/usdc, moon/brick or a future one, actually do so and don't stand idle in the between.*

8/3/23,Why can't I see my MOONs on metamask?,"Hello everyone, need help on what am I doing wrong or not getting right.

I downloaded MetaMask for my internet browser, then went on my mobile phone and opened my vault, it says r/CryptoCurrency and it shows the number of MOONs I have which is 2.233. I then go into settings and copy my recovery phrase (also already did Reddit backup).

With this 12 word recovery phrase I connected to metamask using existing wallet and created a password. Then I added the Arbitrum Nova network and then added MOONs token address which is 0x0057Ac2d777797d31CD3f8f13bF5e927571D6Ad0.

It shows 0 MOON :(

What am I doing wrong?

EDIT:

IT WORKED! Thanks u/bananainbeijing for figuring it out for me.

>Here's what I would suggest. Under the recovery phrase in Reddit, there is a string of text and numbers. That is your private key.  
>  
>Also please DO NOT paste that here. It will give straight access to your wallet.

>Click ""Import Account"" in Metamask (when you click the top right circle) and copy the private key in there. It should pull up your Reddit address. This is what I did.

>What I guess is happening is that when you import using the recovery phrase, Metamask autogenerates an Ethereum addresses. But it may not be your specific Reddit address. You can generate multiple addresses using one seed phrase, but the private key is exclusive to one address.

8/3/23,Liquidity Provider on Sushi: Changes After 1.5 Days,"Hi guys, my previous post got removed because there were already 2 posts about Moons in the top 50. Reposting here:

I'm pretty bullish on Moons so I decided to start providing liquidity yesterday. Part of the rationale was for the rewards, but also because I've been a Redditor for a long time (10+ years!), and I thought this would be a good way to contribute to the community.

I didn't have many Moons compared to some of the whales on here, so I went on Sushi and bought 1 ETH of Moons, and then contributed around 7,750 Moons and 1 ETH to the pool. 

[Here is my position] (https://imgur.com/YPoMOlv). The picture on the left is a screenshot from about 20 minutes ago, and the picture on the right is when I just added the liquidity yesterday in the afternoon.

The things to notice are the changes in the staked position. When I bought Moons yesterday, the price was $0.21. It is currently $0.23. 

The resulting effect on my staked position is that I now have about 250 less Moons, but I have slightly (.04) more ETH. This makes sense because people are swapping their ETH for Moons, meaning they are essentially adding ETH to the pool, and taking out Moons (the exact same effect on my staked position).

The opposite would be true if the price of Moons went down, meaning I would have less ETH, but more Moons, due to people selling Moons to the pool. This is where being bullish on Moons and on the community will help me keep my staked position up. Because I'm not worried at all about any dips in the price, because I believe it will eventually come back up, and go even higher.

Another piece of information is that after 36 hours or so, I earned about **20 Moons** due to the staked position and rewards. This will of course come down as more people provide liquidity and the rewards drop. I am currently a little over 1% of the pool, so the rewards also make sense since it's 1% of 1,260 moons / day.

[The next image](https://imgur.com/gallery/JFsyQC1) is of the different APRs from yesterday to today. As you can see, the APR has come down from about 56% to 48%. I expect this to drop further as mentioned above.

Hopefully this can provide some useful information for people that are considering providing liquidity, and can put some concrete numbers out there. 

Also, as a disclaimer, please make sure to do adequate research before providing liquidity. Make sure you have an understanding of impermanent loss, as well as accounting for risks like the Arbitrum Nova bridge getting hacked, Sushi getting hacked, etc... I have a rather high risk tolerance, but what works for me may not work for you."

8/3/23,A reminder that Coinbase still has major insider trading going on,"Unfortunately there aren’t a lot of popular exchanges to choose from anymore but Coinbase has stuck around through it all. While I want a fair and transparent exchange Coinbase is not that. A year ago we learned that a lot of people who worked inside Coinbase were pumping and dumping.

Basically employees who know what coins will be listed in the near future will buy up a ton on a separate market, and once they are announced to be listed on Coinbase publicly or actually are listed then the employee dumps those coins on the oblivious market.

This has continued with Coinbase with only a couple employees actually being caught, most will never be caught as you can’t put a name to a wallet unless they come out and somehow attach themselves to a transaction.

We also have to admit that most exchanges probably have employees doing this. You can bet that employees of gemini or crypto.com are also going to take advantage of this. So once you read that article about a coin being listed on an exchange in the future it’s most likely too late for you.

You can check the comments for source"
8/3/23,How do you trust small projects and what exchanges are best for small market cap coins,"As someone who is relatively new to the cryptocurrency space (since around September of 2021), I have observed Bitcoin experiencing some significant price increases, and I have also witnessed other coins skyrocketing in value by as much as 5 times their initial worth. However, it seems that once a coin is listed on a larger exchange, it has already reached its peak potential for big gains. For instance, coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin experienced their significant price increase before they were added to major exchanges.

As I try to gain more knowledge about the market cycles and investing in cryptocurrency, I'm curious about how to discover low market cap coins and how to believe in them. The best advice I have heard so far is to invest in projects that you believe in and that have a real purpose. However, how can one believe in these unproven coins? Is it just a matter of watching trends and getting on them early?

I would love to hear your thoughts and insights on how you discover low market cap coins and how you decide which ones to invest in. Additionally, how do you determine the potential of these coins, and what kind of research do you conduct before making an investment decision? Who are some good crypto content creators for somewhat novices?"

I have been using coinstats since I got serious, which was fine for awhile, but it messed up my ratios recently when they had a server issue, and also I notice it doesn't seem to support Arbitrum Nova for some reason, which bugs me,since it apparently supports Arbitrum one.

So, any better free apps out there that accurately pull the data from your wallet and show you your ratios? Manually doing it is a pain.

I looked at the metamask portfolio on the desktop version but noticed that also isn't ideal since it only really works with the main top 10 stuff.

Freedom is great, but it's expensive as hell.

Just ask anyone how they feel after losing.

It's actually a benefit to learn about protecting yourself now because scammers are only going to get more creative and active in the future. 

Learn about security features on your chains of choice and how to implement them. There will be night and day realizations that you come across when you explore security features, and some chains will really make you reconsider your previous investing choices once you find out about how they can leave your ass hanging in the wind.

I wanted to give her the ability to access my crypto.  It was as simple as ""Here's the location of my seed phrase. If you need to access the money, it's here."" Now, I had to show her how to restore my ledger with the seed, but after a few tries she got the hang of it, and if she ever forgets, she'll easily be able to follow YouTube instructions.

When she went to add me to her bank account, it went like this-

1. Take time off work to show up to the bank together to add me to the account (needs to be in person, can't be done online)
2. Get told, ""Unfortunately the bankers that are able to do that aren't in. I can schedule an appointment for you.""
3. Take time off work to go back to the bank 3 days later.
4. Wait an extra 45 minutes after our scheduled appointment because the person before us was taking longer than expected
5. Provide all the necessary identifications (marriage certificates, driver's license, social security #, etc)
6. Get told I cannot be added to the account because even though my wife is the primary account holder, her mother is a secondary account holder and I cannot be added without all account holders present.
7. My wife asks if she can remove the secondary account holder, and is told she cannot without the account holder present.  

We are now stuck at this step.  Here are the remaining steps to add me to the account.

1. My wife needs to fly to her or her mother needs to fly to us when an appointment is scheduled (only during weekdays)
2. The 3 of us need to go back to the bank, bring 2 forms of ID to the bank. Remove mother from the account and add me.

The only other option we have is to close the account and open a new one with me on the account.  However, that creates its own set of problems since direct deposits and auto bill-pays come from that account.

I still believe there's a place for banks in our society (mainly because of insurance), but they really need to streamline their processes or else the ease of use with crypto is going to leave them behind"

8/3/23,It doesn’t require a lot of money to become rich in crypto,"Seen a post the other day that essentially said there are 2 ways to become a millionaire in crypto
One way about needing to start with a couple hundred thousand dollars invited in crypto to become a millionaire. 
The other way was to get lucky on a 1000x alt coin 

The mindset for the 2 explains above are too short thinking

In reality I think the most important thing is time horizons. If someone is focusing on getting millions in a short amount of time, like one cycle then the odds are that it won’t happen for the average person 
BUT if you zoom out and focus on 2 cycles or 3 cycles then the odds are more in your favor

We are still on the early side of the adoption curve for crypto. Put things into perspective and enjoy the process. The total market cap of crypto is currently just over one trillion dollars which is VERY small compared to the market cap of other global assets. Just think where it’ll be 10 years from now."
8/3/23,It's very risky to invest in any other coin than Bitcoin and Ethereum,"You see people investing in all kind of coins whether they be meme coins or other alts with purpose /usecase but I can just never trust them enough to think them worthy of investing. Seeing how many coins have fallen out of the Top 10 list before, it feels like they will too and aren't a safe bet at all




But seeing how long Bitcoin and Ethereum has endured, I have *a lot* more trust in these than any other coin and can't imagine investing in anything else, or at least long term. 



But i do understand the fact that these won't make you as much as those alts might do, so it's kind of a risk to make more. But when it comes to investing longterm, Bitcoin and Ethereum are the only two options that i see. And even they're not 100% safe of course.


At least you can safely invest and be sure that if you're patient, you'll have the best chances of making money with them, even is it takes long. 


What other coin do you think might become the 3rd and stay in the top 10 just as long?"

8/3/23,I bought into the STX hype so you don't have to. Here's a very brief early stage review,"I purchased 100 Stacks (STX) as the coin began to pump a few weeks ago, because I heard about the Stacking rewards program and I wanted to give it a shot.

Per wikipedia:  **Stacks**, formerly **Blockstack**, is an open-source platform to enable smart contracts, DeFi, NFTs, and apps for Bitcoin. It is a layer 1 network that secures it's smart contracts directly on the Bitcoin blockchain.  STX became the first SEC qualified token offering in 2019.

The most attractive thing to me about STX is it's staking system, which pays out BTC rewards. The wallet I chose to use is Xverse, which is a simple web3 wallet on the chrome extension store which allows you to store BTC and STX by default.

Key Takeaways:

1. Staking STX (Stacking) pays out BTC rewards to any BTC wallet. 100 STX is required to begin staking.
2. Stack periods are 2 week lock periods where your STX are locked for the duration of the cycle. you can pre-configure 1-6 periods for 2-13 weeks of consecutive staking. I haven't gotten this far yet, but I assume I have to manually re-stake after my cycles end. I loaded up for 6 cycles just to set it and forget it:

https://preview.redd.it/2pn16rucxema1.png?width=1329&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e36b729814eb11ea8f54975ba2a82e355d7cde0b

Because I began my lockup period in the middle of a cycle, I had to wait until a new cycle began before i started generating rewards. I've only just begun the first cycle and the BTC payout is displaying a variable amount that seems to go up and down. The APY has varied from as low as 5.66% up to 13% and back again. I'm not really sure what is driving or determining these rates yet.

3. xVerse Wallet can store Ordinals NFTs. I don't own any, but if you're looking for a wallet that can host them, I believe this is one of the premier options. This seems to be the reason for the STX pump.

4. Fees for STX related chain activities are set at 0.25 STX and I dont think I am being charged any fees for adding to the stack pool, which currently has 20.5 BTC and just under 20 million STX locked.

All in all, i'm excited to be staking and earning BTC rewards without having to lockup actual BTC. I'm pretty sure the rewards were higher on day 1 than they were on day 2. I have my rewards address as a deposit address for my BTC in another storage, so I don't have to worry about paying fees to move it from the Xverse Wallet to another portfolio.

100 STX is viable enough for me that I'm comfortable just watching and seeing where this goes. I wouldn't do anything crazy like convert my BTC holdings to STX and I've yet to see any tangible rewards yet that can say that the risk is actually worth it.

Heres a video with more info on stacking and how rewards are generated:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Z3IICfCnjo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Z3IICfCnjo)

8/3/23,Helpful tips: 7 little tricks to improve the security of your seed phrase and wallets.,"The great thing about crypto is you're in full control, which means you can customize your security to the level you want.

Here's 7 additional tricks and actions to help your security.

&#x200B;

# 1- A decoy wallet.

This trick will alert you if someone is after your funds, and gained access to your computer.

There's a few tricks.

The main one is to put the info for a decoy wallet, seed phrase, etc... on a file on your computer. Make a folder called crypto. And put either the seed, or make a wallet with only something like $20.

If someone drains that, you'll know someone has compromised your connection or computer, and is actively looking for your files.

It will be like a booby trap that will alert you if you're being targeted.

You can also do the same with your physical seed phrase and hardware wallet.

Buy a cheap second hand Ledger or Trezor, on ebay or craigslist. Some go for $15. You can also put a sheet for a seed phrase. And put it somewhere where a thief will think they've found where you hide your seed phrase.

&#x200B;

# 2- You don't have to write your seed on paper. You can use something more durable.

When they say ""write your seed down"", it doesn't have to be paper.

Paper can degrade, you could spill your coffee on it, or it can get lost in the other pile of papers you have.

And what happens if there's a fire in your house?

You can actually engrave your seed on steel plates (preferably fire resistant plates).

&#x200B;

[Fire resistant plate after going through a fire](https://preview.redd.it/ww984i4ihjma1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=868e323ef4205e4549813da6052fe8c38dc4a4ee)

&#x200B;

# 3- You can encrypt your seed phrase.

You can write your seed phrase in the correct order. It will be easy for you to recover, but anyone who gets a hold of that, can get into your funds.

You can use all types of tricks to change the order, cypher, or encrypt your seed phrase. All have different level of difficulty to decrypt. One easy and effective method is to simply add a 25th passphrase.

Just make sure you know how to recover it and don't make it too hard for yourself. There's a better chance that you lock yourself out than there is of anyone ever coming for your seed phrase.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dqw4x5mmhjma1.png?width=171&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1809fdcdc9a37d03453f9951d92c357afbaad695

&#x200B;

# 4- Split the location of your seed phrase.

You don't have to have the seed on one piece of paper or plate in your house. You can have multiple location. Or, if you have a trusted second location, you can use multiple geographic locations.

You will need to remove at least 3 words. That will give you more than enough time to move the funds.

But you can simply split it in half, 3, etc...

You can also have a duplicate hardware wallet or seed phrase at another location. If your seed is encrypted, you're able to do that more safely. This will give you an extra safety net to make sure you can recover your funds.

&#x200B;

# 5- Using the right type of safe.

If you have a lot of funds, you may want to consider a safe for your hard wallet or seed phrase.

This is where you don't want to get some cheap Sentry safe from Walmart. Many of the cheaper safes you commonly see in stores, have security issues.

You want a safe with these features:

\-One of the better brands.

\-Something that can't be picked up and carried.

\-Something that can't be pulled out of a wall.

\-Something you can bolt to the ground.

\-Fire resistant for a reasonable amount of hours.

\-Preferably not a safe with a key, but with a keypad. Pretty much any lock can be picked.

Alternatively, you can use a safety deposit box. But they come with disadvantages. You have to continuously pay rent. You don't own them, you rent them. They can be seized. Even by the IRS. And you have to trust an entire staff of people and company.

&#x200B;

# 6- Don't go around telling people about your crypto.

This is the easiest way to avoid being a target, and protect your funds.

It works the same way with jewelry, or any big valuables in your house.

The fewer people know you have very big ticket items (preferably portable) in your house, the less likely you'll be a target.

&#x200B;

# 7- It's all about those emails and links.

While we tend to talk a lot about wrench attacks, the odds of them are extremely low, and have been a very rare occurrence.

That's because if someone is gonna go after your fund, they're going to do it through emails and scam links.

The most common one is through phishing. Sending you some fake email about having to log back in to your Coinbase account.

Or maybe some fake Ledger email asking for your seed phrase (no one should ever ask you for your seed phrase).

Or they do it with a malicious link. It can also be an email, like a fake one about an Amazon package. Or with some scam coin, or bullshit contest.

Scam contests have also become popular.

That's when they tell you that you  could win some coins, or have already won some, or they're gonna airdrop you something. But they're just trying to get your seed phrase.

Some of the more sneaky scams use smart contracts, where interacting with the contract could drain your funds.

So watch out what you click. Don't respond to emails, go directly to the site. And watch out for DMs, contests, scam coins, bridge and contract interaction.

I would even recommend doing anything financial or crypto related not from a phone. Preferably do it all on a separate computer, or vritual machine, that you don't typically use to browse. Bonus if it runs on Linux. Also, there's an army of tools you can use to improve the security of your browser, from active malware detection, to script blockers."

Currently traders are predicting a 50 BPS rate hike with almost 75% probability.

In terms of bitcoin price this might guide the price into a well known reversal pattern. Where price makes a higher high with an impending higher low.

Higher low (anything above 17k) would confirm a change in trend on a macro level.. and would likely mean that the bottom is in.

8/3/23,How was 2013 like - From Crypto Craze to Institutional Acceptance,"Crypto had come a long way from where it started. It feels completely different. It's like a fast-and-furious series where a movie has evolved and gotten bigger and bigger every time.

Here are 10 memorable incidents that happened a decade ago!

1. **Reddit Accepts Bitcoin:** In February 2013, Reddit announced that it would accept Bitcoin as a form of payment for its premium membership program, Reddit Gold. The move was seen as a significant step toward mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate currency.
2. **Silk Road Shutdown**: In October 2013, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) shut down Silk Road
3. **Mt. Gox Hack:** In February 2013, Mt. Gox, got hacked in which 850,000 bitcoins, worth around $473 million at the time, were stolen.
4. **Ethereum's Whitepaper:** In December 2013, Vitalik Buterin published the whitepaper for Ethereum, a blockchain platform that would later become one of the most popular and widely used cryptocurrencies in the world.
5. **US Gov. Auctions Seized Bitcoins:** In June 2013, the US government held its first Bitcoin auction, in which it sold over 30,000 bitcoins seized from the online black market Silk Road.
6. **US Senate Hearings on Bitcoin:** In November 2013, the US Senate held a hearing on Bitcoin, which was the first time the cryptocurrency had been discussed at such a high level of government.
7. **The First Bitcoin ATMs**: In 2013, the first Bitcoin ATMs were installed in Vancouver, Canada, and Austin, Texas.
8. **Dogecoin's Launch:** In December 2013, The currency was initially created as a joke but quickly gained popularity due to its fun and friendly branding and active community.
9. **Ripple Labs Launches:** In September 2013, Ripple Labs launched its payment protocol and digital currency, XRP. Ripple aimed to provide a faster and more efficient way of sending money globally, and its success has helped to pave the way for other blockchain-based payment systems.
10. **Bitcoin Black Friday:** In November 2013, a group of Bitcoin merchants launched ""Bitcoin Black Friday,"" a marketing campaign to encourage consumers to use Bitcoin to buy products and services online. The campaign was a success, with over 1,000 merchants participating and generating over $6 million in sales.

These incidents continued to shape the early days of the cryptocurrency industry, highlighting the importance of privacy, innovation, and sustainable practices in the development and adoption of blockchain technology.

8/3/23,My simplified explanation of impermanent loss,"There are formulas that mathematically break down IL (impermanent loss) with some confusing math, however I wanted to share my understanding in a simplified way.

In short when you join a liquidity pool, you add two coins. Let's say ETH and USDT to make it simple. When the price between those two coins (1 ETH = 1500 USDT) changes (1 ETH = 2000 USDT), it produces IL. 

The easiest way to think of IL now is if you did not join a liquidity pool and you only held ETH but slowly DCA'd out selling your ETH to USDT as it went up. So each time ETH went up a little you sold. Like 1550, 1600, 1650, 1700, etc..

By the time it hit 2000 you may only have 0.5 ETH left and 900 USDT, not 1000 USDT (if you held and sold 0.5 ETH at 2000). That 100 USDT you're missing is the IL. *These are just made up numbers, not the real formula*

Everyone experiences this when DCAing up or down (selling/buying) we just don't call it IL we just ignore it cause WE made the trade and accept it.

Now it's called impermanent because if ETH were to crash back down to 1500 you would slowly start buying back ETH from 1950, 1900, 1850, etc and would be back to owning 1 ETH. 

However with a liquidity pool, the way up and the way down would have made you a ton in bonus fees. You keep your 1 ETH + the fees now. So just remember when you DCA your coins when they rise or fall, you're basically experiencing something similar to impermanent loss."

Of these, 29 are buys and 31 are sells.

The total of the buys is $73,460
The total of the sells is $53,600

Of these, only 3 transactions are greater than $5000, and all 3 are buys, the smallest being 30,060 moons for $5,680 and the largest being 42,620moons for $7,840.

Obviously the value of the buys have been more overall due to the price going up recently, but I wanted to know if this was the shrimp or the whales. The answer appears to be both types are buying more than selling right now. 

Due to the source data, the numbers are rounded to the nearest $10. Being away from home I haven't had time to script this further, but maybe someone else can. Or if this is popular I'll try to find more time

8/3/23,U.S. Senate panel probes how crypto mining increases energy consumption,
8/3/23,It is not essential to start with a lot of money to make a lot of money,"There’s a classic tale that goes like this: the way to make a million dollars in crypto is start with a billion dollars. Having a lot of money to throw at your investments does not guarantee success. Just ask Logan Paul. “Money makes money”, yes it is easier, but I find it disheartening to those without much income that there is no other way to alter our future for the better. The following traits are FREE and, for the most part, only require you to cultivate them to increase the earning potential of your investments:

PATIENCE – A rich person can throw $10k at a popular coin and turn it into $100k by the next ATH. Without that sort of cash injection, you may need to stay in for another bull run to make $100k. Stay in the game long enough to reach your goal. 

RESEARCH - Put your trust and investments in good projects and keep up to date with them. It is your money that is involved here, take ownership of it, and find out exactly which horse you are betting on. 

LUCK – The person that turned $11 to multi-millions with SHIB didn’t have a lot of money and probably had no idea it was going to blow up like it did, but they had luck on their side. Luck is less necessary if you are fine with DCAing into a blue chip and holding it for the next decade.

DISCIPLINE – Only have $5 to DCA with every week? Put that $5 in every week. Don’t stray from the plan you set for yourself. Stay away from FOMO and emotional decision making. This also counts for your non-crypto life as well: stay off those cigarettes so you have more money to invest with. 

DON’T BE GREEDY – Good things come to those who wait and if you are expecting at 100x in a few weeks you are asking to get rekt. Lower your expectations and be satisfied with each gain instead of chasing that next moonshot. 

While the above will not guarantee results, having a fat bankroll won’t either. Success is using whatever you have to your advantage."

8/3/23,Impact of Blockchain on Agricultural sector,"Impact of Blockchain on Agriculture sector.

Feed The Future, a development program focused on agriculture finance in Africa, is going to show how can agriculture benefit from the implementation of blockchain technology with AgriFi. Blockchain can provide a secure and transparent ledger for financial transactions, enabling AgriFI to better track the flow of funds and reduce the risk of fraud. Additionally, smart contracts can be used to automate the disbursement of funds based on predetermined conditions, such as the completion of specific milestones or the verification of certain documentation. This can reduce administrative overhead and increase the efficiency of the funding process.

As a key technology provider for AgriFI, AllianceBlock in partnership with USAID will provide its expertise in blockchain technology to develop a custom solution that meets the specific needs of the program. This will certainly assist smallholder farmers to ensure that Feed The Future program is achieved by 2025.

 Additionally, AllianceBlock can provide consulting services to help AgriFI optimize its use of blockchain technology and ensure the security and scalability of the platform. This will definitely unlock the full potential of blockchain technology and drive meaningful impact in the agriculture finance sector

In conclusion, blockchain and DeFi have the potential to transform the agricultural finance sector by offering greater financial inclusion and economic growth. It's likely that more partnerships and collaborations will emerge in the future, leading to more efficient and innovative solutions for the industry..

What are your thoughts on the impact of blockchain and DeFi on the agricultural finance sector, and how do you see it evolving in the future?"
8/3/23,Let's Talk About Two-Factor Auth,"Hey /r/cryptocurrency!  


I made some comments on the posts regarding the individual suing Coinbase yesterday and based on some of the responses I thought a post about Two-Factor Auth (2FA) would be a good idea. There seems to be a good understanding that SMS is not ideal but not necessarily why.  


Who am I to give any kind of advice? Well, I work in Cyber Security and have some experience working for a Cryptocurrency exchange. During my time there I did a lot of Penetration Testing of the 2FA system we used, especially on additional forms of 2FA we pushed out. I no longer work in the industry as I did not want my ability to make my mortgage payment to be tied to bear/bull runs but I'm still here DCAing with the rest of you and I'd love if everyone here who chooses to keep their funds on an exchange did so as safely as possible, though I will parrot the most common advice on this sub and highly recommend you do not as your wallet is safer than your exchange account in regards to account takover.  


Let's first talk about the pre-requisite to any 2FA failing you. Regardless of what form of 2FA you use, an attacker accessing your funds on an exchange needs to know your username and password. Without this information, being able to bypass 2FA does them no good. This is why every single security professional would recommend that you have a unique password for each financial application you are using and the email account you are tying to these applications. This way, if your password for another application is compromised and then sold on the black market without your knowledge (companies should disclose a breach but not everyone keeps track of every email they receive), an attacker cannot reuse that username/password combo to log into your exchange account.  


Now unfortunately that is not the only way an attacker can gain knowledge of your username/password. Phishing campaigns are notorious for tricking users into parting with their unique username/password combinations. Even if you do everything right (unique passwords), if an attacker manages to trick you into providing them with your exchange password by sending you a link to a site that looks identical to your exchange, you are shit out of luck. This is why despite the fact that it is technically possible to use SMS safely, I would never recommend it as even the most knowledgeable user can still be bamboozled. 

&#x200B;

So now let's talk about SMS and why it is one of the worst forms of 2FA (though I'd argue it might still be better than getting One Time Passcodes to your email). SMS, unlike using a Yubikey, Push2FA, Google Authenticator, or ID Verification is susceptible to an attack called SIM Swapping. I'm sure many of you have heard of this attack but let me break it down for you so that everyone who reads this has a basic understanding. SIM swapping occurs when an attacker gains enough personal information about a victim (via phishing, purchasing information off the blackmarket, or Open Source Intelligence Gathering ie OSINT) and uses that information to convince that victim's cellular company that they are infact that person. The cellular company then uses the same technology that allows for phone number portability to port the victim's number to the attacker's SIM card. The victim now no longer has a working phone number and the attacker will now receive any text's intended for the victim. The attacker then using the username/password combination obtained via a method described previously in this post authenticates as  the victim and receives the SMS text with the OTP and they now have your funds.   


So how do we fight this? We use literally any other form of 2FA. How would I personally rank them? Probably like this:  


1. Yubikey - connected to your device it provides a code as your second factor of authentication
2. TOTP i.e. Google Auth, Okta, etc
3. Push2FA - instead of entering a code from an app, a modal is pushed to your mobile app that you then use to approve the login. I don't love this method either, but it's way more useable than IDV and more secure than SMS. If you really have an aversion to Google Auth, I guess this is the way. 
4. ID verification - what it sounds like, you use your Government ID. Typically this is used for account recovery and when done well protects the user by providing them a way to get their account back without having to use customer support. If an attacker tries to use this to downgrade another form of 2FA the user is informed and can then change their password. 

I rank Yubikey #1 because it is the easiest item to keep safe without sacrificing usability. Most people do not carry their Yubikey around with them everywhere so it can stay protected in your home. TOTP  on the other hand is only as hardened as your cell phone is if it gets stolen from you. I once had a friend who knew I was a ""hacker"" ask me to hack her phone and she handed it to me. I assumed I'd open it, attempt to guess her pin and hand it back as we were eating dinner and I don't carry my laptop everywhere, but she didn't even have a lock on her phone. I went to her also unprotected Venmo app and showed her how easy it would be to send myself money. Now this was years ago and I'd say most people are smart enough to lock their devices but not all methods of device locking are created equal either so know that if you do choose to use TOTP it is only as secure as your phone is. Additionally, most TOTP codes are short (6 digits) whereas Yubikey's code is fairly verbose. If the application does not implement rate limiting in theory a savvy attacker could brute force TOTP. An application that only rate limits by IP could be beaten by someone using a tool like this: [https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/IPRotate\_Burp\_Extension](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/IPRotate_Burp_Extension). 

&#x200B;

Two last things to expand upon. I do not know of an exchange that allows email OTP for authentication, however I do know of traditional banks that do. Please, for the love of god and all that is holy do not use email 2FA. If an attacker compromises your email account they now have the keys to every application you have configured this way. Essentially all they need to do now is Password Reset, change your creds, and login. If they are really savvy, they will change your email filtering rules so that the victim does not get notifications of emails regarding sites the attacker is trying to compromise. As for my dislike of Push2FA, it is primarily because it forces the user to be discerning. Most people have the intelligence to not just approve any push notification sent to them, but not everyone does and even if they do, if an attacker times their push notification right after the user's they could trick them into approving the wrong modal.   


So to summarize this post. Please do not use SMS as a form of 2FA. It is incredibly insecure compared to other methods of 2FA. Ideally, use a Yubikey but if you cannot afford another piece of technology after spending money on wallets and crypto at least use TOTP and hope that your exchange rate limits properly. If you have any questions for me I am now getting started work an hour late so I may be slow to respond but I will try to get back to any security related questions on this post! Stay safe out there friends."

The most interesting thing about this is their relayer technology. Being able to use this sidechain without the user even knowing its using it. The gas payment needed to use this sidechain will all be paid for automatically when doing the transaction on lets say ethereum. 

Is this the next step in UX we've been waiting for? Even though an extra level of depth gets added to a dapp/transaction it does not penalize the user for it.

There are already more than **100 blocks** waiting to be discovered on the **bitcoin** blockchain and more than **18,000 transactions** waiting to be confirmed, in a network with very limited **TPS** capacity.

This is not good for **BTC**.

Fees can start to increase exponentially at any time as more users want to complete their transactions more urgently and jump ahead of other waiting transactions.

The game theory here is that bids for the high priority fees start to go up, pulling the medium and low priority fees along.

Other users who have not wanted to move their money so far are starting to worry about the increase in fees and make preventive moves, such as sending to exchanges, cold wallets, hot wallets or to second layers, such as Lightning — which can create a kind of a 'bank run' that raises bids for fees even further.

Let's see what will happen in the next days."

( https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/11lvr29/100_in_eth_if_you_guess_the_order_of_my_seed/ ) 

To give you some insights, on how tough it is to break seed phrases.

The seed phrase has 24 words in it 

camera rhythm feature layer coconut ready need final north can early story stable report group depend employ problem monitor interest logic sausage toilet pencil

So the total number of possible combinations for these words, assuming all 24 words are correct but random, is 24! or 6,204,484,903,000,000,000,000,000 (approximately 6.2 x 10^23).

Suppose you use a super powerful computer with lots or parallel processing power, and you run several jobs at once to hit and trial on all these possible combinations

if we try 1000 combinations per second (considering that's even possible) 

it would take approximately 19.6 trillion years to go through all possible combinations of 24 words at a rate of 1000 combinations per second. This is an incredibly long time, longer than the current age of the universe, which is around 13.8 billion years.

Even if we go a million transactions per second, it would still take an incredibly long time, approximately 19.6 million years, to go through all possible combinations.

Pretty safe to say, no one will be able to crack that seed phrase."

8/3/23,Jerome Powell wants to support the cryptocurrency market,"The chairman of the Federal Reserve (Fed) in the United States, Jerome Powell, spoke before the Senate Banking Committee yesterday. During his speech, he sowed seeds of uncertainty regarding further interest rate hikes, but also shared the institution's stance on the regulation of cryptocurrencies.

# Jerome Powell wants to support the cryptocurrency market 

Jerome Powell was questioned by the chairman of the U.S. Banking Committee, Sherrod Brown, on Tuesday. The Fed chief received many questions about the cryptocurrency sector and related regulations.

Brown wanted to know, among other things, how Powell assessed the risks associated with digital assets and what he thought about regulators' actions. The head of the Federal Reserve seems to be looking calmly at this industry. He sees its potential, but also disturbing issues related to various turbulences in this market.

>""We are quite active in this area. \[...\] We believe that innovation is very important for the economy from a time perspective. We do not want to stifle it, and we do not want regulations to suffocate innovation in a way that favors current operators.""

he stated.

In saying so, he emphasized the noticeable amount of turbulence in this sector and many fraudulent practices that are often aided by a lack of appropriate regulations. Powell also announced that his team's goal is to monitor this sector, but also to ensure that financial institutions have appropriate regulations imposed on them to help them navigate the cryptocurrency space.

Furthermore, he drew attention to the fact that the Federal Reserve recently warned many financial institutions about the risks associated with the high volatility of digital asset liquidity markets. Together with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), notifications were sent to banks and financial trustees to exercise special caution in adopting cryptocurrencies.

# There is a place for stablecoins in the financial market 

Jerome Powell clearly states that the US Congress must urgently develop and implement ""working legal frameworks"" for cryptocurrencies. Additionally, he separately addressed one of the segments of digital assets, namely stablecoins. He stated that ""there is a place for stablecoins in the financial sector,"" but they must be properly regulated."
8/3/23,What kind of narrative can push your portfolio despite bad macroeconomics?,"He did it again! Powell sent an unwelcome message to the market.

The Federal Reserve will likely raise interest rates soon. This can be a strong indication that prices  
will keep moving sideways without any clear trend for some time to come.

What are your most relevant positions and what kind of narrative can push your projects despite  
macroeconomic conditions?

Considering my portfolio, I expect DeFi to reach mainstream adoption and global industries to  
join the smart contract ecosystem once and for all.

Avalanche can benefit from it since its goal is to tokenize the world’s assets. Some digital  
securities firms like DEFYCA will be integrated into Avalanche and the partnership with Amazon  
can push blockchain adoption.

Optimism is another helpful example. A fast-growing L2 that has already integrated with several  
Defi protocols. The Bedrock release can boost the project and position it as a L2 leader.

As for Defi, it seems that LSDs are here to stay. I believe Lido can benefit from it along with the  
Shanghai upgrade. In addition, Dafi, a low-capital project, is planning to launch a hybrid  
exchange that will combine the features of CEX, DEX, and can push the price up. Aave is still my  
top pick in this trend. The launch of GHO is critical to the success of the project and can  
strengthen their ecosystem.

I also believe that Cardano can grow through the introduction of stables, Hydra, and Oracles.

These are just a few examples of narratives. What are yours?"

She had some MATIC that she transferred from Coinbase to CB Wallet, but apparently was undergoing a brainfart when she did so. She did not pay attention to which address she sent it to.

Upon linking CB Wallet to Opensea, it does not show her having any funds (with which to buy NFTs). After poking around, she noticed she had used the Ethereum network to do so, not the Polygon network.

I know that sending crypto to the wrong network often/mostly/usually results in losing your coins, but that also there is a special relationship between the Ethereum and Polygon networks. The MATIC does appear in her Coinbase Wallet, but she can't seem to get it to Opensea. Obviously, she is new at this.

Any thoughts?

8/3/23,Vitalik ignoring some basic rules,"Vitalik is a really popular guy, he's also filthy rich and people know his wallet addresses.

All these things culminate in him probably being a very big target for crypto scams, attention seekers and everything else.

If you check his ethereum wallets:

https://preview.redd.it/mljhfcbz9kma1.png?width=437&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=227eaa18600c7d1d6013d0bbf923cc5607165529

Amongst just 2 wallets he has over $10 million in tokens + more in Eth. Over 201 tokens in each address, meaning people send him shit coins all day long in some sort of hopes of getting his attention or whatever.

Recently he has gone on a selling spree and got rid of a lot of these shitcoins.

[Cointelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/news/vitalik-dumps-700k-worth-of-shitcoins-that-he-never-asked-for) \- is just one of the articles about the whole thing.

&#x200B;

Then I remembered something. One of the main security tips that people around here like to give is to not interact with shitcoins, just leave them there it's safer.

Not only that rule, but another rule came to mind when I thought of it: Unlimited Approvals!

There have been various issues regarding unlimited approvals, lots of people lost money but also it was just a small % of people that do unlimited approvals, I usually do it because it's just more convenient than having to change the transaction.

[Lots of SHIT on there. I mean SHIB](https://preview.redd.it/rr0ffngjbkma1.png?width=702&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dc634a952dffbf413215aab378f46c90464ec3a1)

He has some truly shitcoins amongst his token approvals, but given the amount of tokens he gets it's fairly few approvals.

&#x200B;

Vitalik obviously has the necessary skills to observe what coins might pose a threat to his funds, but I just found this quite interesting that he approves unlimited and interacts with some shitcoins.

Given that people say he does test transactions before sending the full amount. Now I kind of doubt he actually does test transactions.

&#x200B;

tldr; Vitalik does unlimited token approvals and interacts with certain shitcoins. While usually people tell us to not do any of those due to security risks.

So do you guys do unlimited approvals? How often do you guys revoke token permissions?"

The Hands was Rojom's flagship avatar, with 100+ mints and originally sold for $75 on the Reddit Shop. To check its first mint, you can go to its [OpenSea page](https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x8d0501d85becda92b89e56177ddfcea5fc1f0af2/0). Second to it there is The [Hands #2](https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x8d0501d85becda92b89e56177ddfcea5fc1f0af2/1), sold for 19 ETH.

Before you get hyped and take a second mortgage to buy in gen3, though, you should know that **there is no way to know which avatars will have more value than others on the side market**. In my opinion it's mostly luck. Of course if the mint is low you can expect the price to be higher, right? Not quite. Ocean Explorer of Love had only 150+ items, but is ranked #70 on the price list and is selling for around 0.02 ETH.

That being said, **if you're thinking on buying avatars, do so with caution and with money you can afford to lose**. Other than this warning they are a lot of fun, though.

For newcomers, the last releases had the following initial price ranges: 0-$10, $10-$25, $25-$50, $50-$75, $75+. The prices are related to the number of mints each piece has. The lower the price, the higher the mints. You can buy them directly on Reddit's Native App or the desktop website.

8/3/23,The digital pound: Busting the privacy myths,
8/3/23,"The FUD is real. So it’s my story time. This is how I turned $20k into an engagement ring, baller wedding, Tesla, and a year-long sabbatical.","In 2017, I was the chief marketing officer of a tech startup. A competitor launched an ICO at the tip top peak of the ‘17/‘18 run up. The ICO was a total scam but extremely successful. I was put in charge of figuring out if we should do the same thing for our company. 

We never ended up doing an ICO for a lot of reasons, many ethical and the market had crashed, but the research was enthralling. I was orange pilled, but had zero cash because I was a serial failed entrepreneur at the time. 

In early 2020, I had a couple of fortunate events coincided, which left me with $20k cash. I had yet to decide to invest when covid hit China, where I was living at the time. 

Because of how China handled covid in the first few months, the country snapped back to normal-ish pretty quick. Then covid hit the rest of the world hard and the market took a dump in March. 

At the time, I thought the world would snap back like China did, so I threw everything I had into TSLA. Obviously the world didn’t, but the stock market sure as hell did. 

I held TSLA till after the split in August, then I realized I believed in BTC more than I believed in Musk. I took that cash and bought BTC at an average cost of just under 10K. 

Up to that point, these were the best trades of my life and only happened because I didn’t fall for the FUD. For me, covid was far scarier than all the war, failing crypto companies, and legislation we have going on right now. But honestly, I followed my gut and research, and lucked out. 

Then I just sat and waited with pretty clear understanding of the halving cycle phenomenon. Of course, shit happens, like having 1 BTC stolen in May of 2021 because I asked my Dad to do something I never should have asked him to do. But that was a HUGE lesson and helped me mentally later when it was time to sell. 

In late 2020, I met the girl of my dreams. By the end of 2021, I knew I wanted to spend as much time as we are destined to spend with each other and make a family together. 

I started to sell BTC, not because of the price, but because there were things I wanted more in life. I bought her a dope engagement ring, then sold enough to make sure I could afford the wedding of her dreams. Making the person I loved happy became the most important thing to me. 

Later, in early 2022, I sold more BTC to buy us a new Model Y. Really felt like my investments had come full circle at that point. Funny enough though, six months later we sold the car for 10% more than we paid for it. Which is now in large part funding a year-long sabbatical that my wife and I are currently on. 

A couple more strange events took place, like me getting laid off and receiving a significant severance package, all of which I have invested back into crypto over the last 6 months.

I have been extremely lucky and a little unlucky while investing in crypto. But when I look back, the best choices came from understanding the cycles, being brave enough to to go all in (with no leverage), and focusing on what was important to me. 

I honestly hope my story is encouraging and helps you make decisions that are best for you when it comes to getting what you want out of investing."

The Binance Proof-of-Reserves report, led by Changpeng Zhao, now shows 24 assets after the addition of 11 new tokens. The newly included tokens are Mask Network (MASK), Enjin Coin (ENJ), WazirX (WRX), The Graph (GRT), Chromia (CHR), Curve Token (CRV), 1Inch Network (1INCH), PowerPool (CVP), Hashflow (HFT), SSV Network (SSV), and Dogecoin (DOGE).

With today's announcement, Binance can boast the largest reserves worth over $63 billion. However, the community believes that PoR alone is not enough.

# Binance updates Proof-of-Reserves, but an audit is still missing

According to Binance's PoR, assets are backed by a minimum of 100% reserves. USDC has the highest support of 5490.55%.

Last month, the company introduced ZK-SNARKs to improve user privacy during verification. In addition, it opened its code to help other exchanges adopt this feature.

However, more than Proof-of-Reserves is needed for full transparency. Therefore, the community is demanding an audit report. Regarding the audit, Binance's Asia-Pacific CEO Leon Foong explained that ""it will take more time."" He justified this by stating that accounting firms do not specialize in cryptocurrencies.

Auditing firm Mazars resigned from Binance after issuing a controversial first report. In addition, the Big Four accounting firms - Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG, and PricewaterhouseCoopers - do not want to cooperate with the exchange. Meanwhile, Deloitte continues to audit Coinbase's financial reports."

8/3/23,Why data infrastructure is key for a transparent carbon market,"The CAD Trust’s open-source data system uses distributed ledger technology -- specifically blockchain technology -- to create an immutable, auditable, and decentralized record of carbon market data.  The CAD Trust operational system is leveraging the Chia Network’s Data Layer built on a public and permissionless blockchain technology. The system is designed to connect disparate registries across the world, establishing a peer-to-peer network for sharing data in alignment with the Paris Agreement. In doing so, it will provide critical data that can help identify “double counting” -- when more than one entity claims the same emissions reductions.  

Blockchain technology provides both the accountability and transactional efficiency, via smart contracts, to address the increasing diversity of Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) systems used to measure GHG emissions reductions; and it also helps account for diversity of regulations, climate assets, and values of mitigation outcomes, within and across jurisdictions.  

A public blockchain powering the CAD Trust establishes an open ecosystem that allows innovators to interact with the CAD Trust data and build new solutions for the market -- for example, resolving current MRV challenges, establishing transparent carbon credit source-to-sink pathways, and increasing market access for project developers.

8/3/23,Idea for a Game that uses Blockcahin tech.,"  

Disclaimer: While I am aware that some of this may have already been included in other games, aside from Axie Infinity, I didn't hear much about them.

The game must be created from the ground up as a NEXT GEN game with the crypto gaming aspect built in as an integral part of the game in order for crypto and gaming to successfully merge.

One intriguing example that came to mind was a game similar to Diablo or Borderland (in some respects), where you have a satisfying loop of hacking and slashing but bring the millions of combinations of rarity of weapons and potions that ARE NFT's that can be traded on the game's market for real money. 

You must play the game and gather resources with varying levels of quality in order to obtain these weapons or potions. 

As an illustration, you need mushrooms, a raven's feather, and pixie dust. Each of these ingredients has a unique quality that can influence the final potion and increase its potency. There is a degree of luck involved in this as well, as even the best resources can result in a potion that is not as effective as it could be if the circumstances or brewer's skill level are unfavorable. This can be categorized as common, rare, epic, or legendary, but within each category there are infinite levels of outcome; for example, an item could be ""rare"" but have characteristics that would make it ""epic,"" but be missing traits to qualify as epic.

Similar requirements apply for gathering high-quality resources and the skills needed to make weapons.

For balancing, new players that possess common and rare items can be placed into games that are for beginners to prevent them from getting stomped by more experienced gamers that have higher-tier loot.

When playing the game, depending on the difficulty, you can loot new potions, weapons, and magic items that can be worth something or nothing (the luck aspect). 

There could also be certain game mods that can be implemented that award crypto that will let you buy these potions or weapons in game, so it’s not totally pay-to-win.

The market place can be a whole thing in itself, as people can sell and buy—or even place a bid on—potions and weapons that they might need for a raid, or just store them in their inventory or wallet. 

This is probably not the best idea, but maybe it will spark something in another developer to create something unique.

8/3/23,"No, I do not want to spend my crypto! I do not want to use my crypto as a currency!","This post is inspired by a few posts I've read here suggesting that people should be spending their crypto because it will help with mass adoption apparently.

Disclaimer: the points in this post aren't exactly sophisticated or very deep. Actually, the points I make are So Captain Obvious but what do you expect as a response to the equally dumb suggestion that ""we should all be spending our crypto if we want adoption"". So if you were looking for deep insights and philosophical wisdom: this might not be the right post for you. 

Ok then. Let's look at the pros and cons of using our crypto as a currency

#Cons:

- Volatility: people who tell you to be spending crypto like to pretend volatility doesn't exist

- Capital Gains Taxes: I might have to pay taxes when I spend my crypto

- Pointless: The business I am spending my crypto in will immediately convert it to fiat because they most likely have to pay their bills in fiat

- Investment or Currency: I bought my tokens to sell them at a higher price. I didn't buy them to spend it at the coffee shop.

#Pros: (the following points will all be super dumb)

- Marketing: Paying with crypto is a way of marketing crypto as a ""hey everybody look how easy it is to transfer crypto from the hot wallet on my phone to the shop. Amazing!"" 

- Business Adoption: Apparently if a lot or cryptobros start spending their crypto, then more businesses will start accepting crypto as a payment option

- Consumer Adoption: People will see that businesses are now accepting crypto and think ""that sounds like a lot of fun, why don't I go and get some crypto too so I can pay with crypto the next time I go to this shop""

- Positive Perception: when you pay your bill with crypto at the bar, all the girls will giggle in awe and whisper to each other ""wow who is this guy, he must be a mega rich whale. I can't wait to get to know him"". All the men will think ""i gotta start paying with crypto too so the girls will give me attention""


So yeah, I honestly don't see the upside in using my volatile crypto as a currency. I mean, if you guys want to spend your crypto - go right ahead. But I personally think it's kind of dumb. 

Maybe IF stablecoins become more regulated and accepted in more places and have lower fees than my credit card, then it would make sense. Otherwise, no."

 This chart shows the dominance of exchange-related deposits and withdrawals compared to all confirmed Bitcoin transactions. It includes the total transaction count and the total number of deposit and withdrawal transactions, as well as the percentage of exchange transactions. Over the past 14 days, Bitcoin deposits have decreased, similar to the decline during the 2019 bear market. However, since the collapse of FTX, Bitcoin withdrawals have been higher than deposits for the first time ever. This trend has continued into 2023 and although the gap between deposits and withdrawals is reducing, withdrawals are still leading. The high number of transactions is mainly due to the popularity of Ordinals.

Proceeds from Women Rise go to a variety of pro-education and gender equality groups. One of the recipients is an online school that offers classes on how NFT artists can make a difference by bringing their work to Web3, the blockchain-based web that’s foreseen to be the next iteration of the Internet. Her short-term goal is for 100,000 girls to gain crypto, blockchain, and Web3 knowledge by the end of 2022. 

4. Cleve Mesidor (@cmesi, @ cmesidor)

Mesidor leads the National Policy Network of Women of Color in Blockchain (where Evans is also a member), which partners with blockchain enterprises and the private sector to help female industry leaders build services and products in the crypto economy. She believes the future of crypto will be racially inclusive, with current trends pointing in that direction. According to Morning Consult, 35% of Black Americans and 37% of Hispanic Americans said they were keen on investing in cryptos compared to the 30% of white Americans who said the same.

Author of ""The Clevolution: My Quest for Justice in Politics & Crypto,"" Mesidor is also the executive director of the blockchain and cryptocurrency movement Blockchain Foundation. The former Obama appointee is also a public policy advisor to the Blockchain Association, which promotes industry-wide collaboration on all things crypto.

The London-based woman also runs a financial well-being and business consultancy called Butterfly Wealth Creation. 

A sought-after international speaker, Osbourne won the 2022 CogX Gender Equality Leader Award and was a recipient of the TechWomen 100 Award in 2020 in the U.K.

7. Kinjal Shah (@\_kinjalbshah)  

Shah co-founded the Komorebi Collective, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that aims to raise money from the blockchain community to help more women and non-binary persons enter the crypto market. Members of the non-profit she256 and Women in Blockchain compose Komorebi's core team.

The blockchain initiatives at Fidelity Investments, where Shah was a senior consulting analyst, sparked her interest in cryptocurrency. Shah—who’s barely 30—is also a partner at Blockchain Capital, a venture capital company investing in blockchain-enabled tech companies. She's also part of the women-focused angel investment group Broadway Angels.

Long is the founder of the Avanti Financial Group, which offers digital asset custody solutions and was recently renamed Custodia Bank. The Wall Street veteran of 22 years successfully pushed the lawmakers in her native Wyoming State to enact 20 blockchain-enabling laws. One of the laws granted bank charters to so-called special-purpose depository institutions (SPDIs), with Avanti being one of them. As a result, SPDIs could legally transact both dollars and digital currencies nationwide. 

9. Preethi Kasireddy (@preethikasireddy, @ iam\_preethi)

Kasireddy is the founder of DappCamp, which promises to equip Web2 developers with skills that will make them ready for Web3 in three weeks. This particularly involves learning how to design, launch, and scale an app on Ethereum (Dapp), including smart contract development. 

The industrial and systems engineer was an investment banking analyst at Goldman Sachs before learning about blockchain while working at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). The venture capital firm invested in Coinbase, where she helped architect and rebuild its web technologies.

The San Francisco-based Kasireddy also established the TruStory, a tokenized digital debate platform that closed in 2020. She said that it had an ""unsustainable"" business model, although it was able to raise $3 million when it started in 2018.

8/3/23,For those that view Doge as a shitcoin.,"This crypto has existed since 2013, that means it's roughly as old as the entire space itself almost. Do yourself a favour, go look at the history of the market, coinmarketcap has a historical marketcap section where you can view the state of the market via various snapshots during different years. You'll notice several coins you've never seen before, in fact hundreds that came and went, but what you'll also notice is that Doge was there since almost the beginning and never went anywhere.

This is extremely rare in crypto, in fact there's a 99% chance that whatever new shiny coin comes under the spotlight will likely end up a forgotten shitcoin among the thousands that can't even be remembered anymore. This is not a shill post for Doge, I hold approximately 0 Doge coins and have no intention of buying me any.

I just thought I'd bring some perspective, it has a thriving community of people that dared to believe, meme and have fun. They got rewarded in the end and the tribalists and the ' cool ' kids got nothing. Crypto is still so new that it really isn't always technology or superior products that win. Point in case, Doge is an OG in this space, it has been around longer than most users on here and will likely outlast quite a few people too. 

Also a reminder to do your due diligence, this space has been discovered by quite a few people since 2013 and more than a few of them aren't looking to meme for fun, they just want to take you to the cleaners. So many people have Doge all wrong though, it is not the same as scam coins that I won't mention because we don't wanna give them air time."
8/3/23,The elite don't want you to know this : How I turned my losses into gains with one simple trick,"Hi everyone, I’m here to share with you how I turned my losses into gains with one simple trick. Maybe some of you can follow my example and achieve the same results.

It all started when I invested $100k in crypto in 2017. I was bullish on Bitcoin and Ethereum and bought them at their all-time highs. I watched as my portfolio grew to $200k by the end of the year. I felt like a genius and a visionary.

Then came 2018 and the bear market. Bitcoin and Ethereum crashed hard and so did my portfolio. I watched as my portfolio shrank to $50k by the end of the year. I felt like an idiot and a loser.

I decided to hold on to my coins and hope for a recovery. But it never came. Instead, the market kept going down and down and down.

By 2020, my portfolio was worth $10k. By 2021, it was worth $5k. By 2022, it was worth $1k.

I was devastated and depressed.
I had lost everything.

But then, I had an idea.

What if I moved to Australia?

You see, in Australia, everything is upside down.

The toilets flush backwards, the seasons are reversed, the animals are weird.

And most importantly,

The charts are inverted.

That means that when the price goes down in the rest of the world,

It goes up in Australia!

So I packed my bags and booked a flight to Sydney.

I arrived in Australia with nothing but my laptop and my crypto wallet.

I opened up CoinMarketCap and checked the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

And what did I see?

They were skyrocketing!

Bitcoin was at $100k AUD!

Ethereum was at $10k AUD!

My portfolio was worth $200k AUD!

I had turned my losses into gains by moving to Australia!

I couldn’t believe it!

I quickly sold all my coins for Australian dollars and withdrew them from an ATM.

I felt like a genius and a visionary again!

Of course, there are some minor details that I left out, such as:

• How I got a visa to enter Australia

• How I found a place to stay in Sydney

• How I dealt with the exchange rate between USD and AUD

• How I paid for taxes on my crypto profits

• How I survived the deadly wildlife in Australia

• How I adjusted to the different culture in Australia

But those are just minor details that don’t matter.

The main point is that I turned my losses into gains by moving to Australia.

And you can too!

Just follow these simple instructions:

Step 1: Buy some crypto at its lowest point

Step 2: Move to Australia

Step 3: Sell your crypto at its highest point

That’s it! That’s how you can turn your losses into gains by moving to Australia. Cheers everyone and good luck!"

8/3/23,Dont be John. Use a hard wallet.,"&#x200B;

John was a crypto enthusiast who had built a small fortune in various cryptocurrencies. He was meticulous about keeping his digital assets safe, storing them in a secure wallet on his computer that he checked daily.

One day, John woke up to find that his wallet was missing. Panic set in as he frantically searched his computer for any sign of it. But it was nowhere to be found. His heart sank as he realized that he might have lost everything.

Desperate to recover his wallet, John contacted a professional crypto recovery service. After weeks of searching, they finally located the wallet on a hard drive that John had thought was wiped clean. But as he tried to transfer his crypto assets to a new wallet, something strange began to happen.

The screen flickered and glitched, and a sinister message flashed on the screen: ""I have your wallet now.""

John froze in terror as he watched his precious crypto assets being siphoned out of his wallet and into a mysterious address. He tried to stop it, but it was too late. The wallet was now under the control of an unknown entity.

As John sat there in horror, his computer began to emit a low humming noise that grew louder and louder until it became a deafening roar. Suddenly, the screen went black, and John was plunged into darkness.

He heard a faint whispering in his ear, and a cold hand touched his shoulder. He turned around to see a ghastly figure staring back at him, its eyes glowing with an eerie light.

""You should have never trusted technology,"" the figure hissed. ""Now, you will suffer for your folly.""

John tried to scream, but no sound came out. He was trapped in a nightmare world where his wallet was gone forever, and his very soul was in jeopardy.

Years later, people still talk about the man who lost his crypto wallet and the horrific fate that befell him. Some say that he still haunts the dark corners of the internet, searching for his lost assets and warning others to beware of the dangers that lurk in the digital realm."
8/3/23,Why do you all love Bitcoin?,"I find it odd. Looking at the technology behind Bitcoin, I just don't get why you all love BTC. When comparing it to other cryptocurrencies it doesn't hold up. 

The cost per transaction is higher than quite a few coins. Like Algo, XRP, XDC, just to name a few. BTC $1, ETH $2, XRP $0.000001, XDC $0.00001

The energy consumption is at a staggering 71.12 TWh while ETH is at 0.0026, XRP is at 0.079, and XDC is at 0.0000074 TWh.

TPS (transactions per second) for BTC is 7, ETH at 30, XRP at 1500+, and XDC is at 2000+.

Block Finalization Time for BTC is 1 hour,  ETH 15 minutes, XRP 6 seconds,  XDC 30 sec.

Bitcoin also doesn't have decentralized apps neither does XRP yet both Ethereum and XDC do. 

After looking at these numbers I wouldn't use bitcoin to transfer money. I would use XRP or XDC. I think the only reason to use bitcoin is because of popularity. For me that's not good enough. I'm asking am I overlooking something here? Why should I invest my money in Bitcoin?"
8/3/23,The bullish case for Solana and why it will be a great ROI [SERIOUS],"Yes you read that right.  I am fully aware this sub hates Solana and am prepared for the hate, but this is a sub for discussion so wanted to bring some positive attention for once.

What would you want in a crypto project the most?  Solana has the developers, the community, NFT platforms, fast tps, low fees, decentralization (yes, its actually decentralized despite what this sub tells you), marketing, partnerships, and innovation.

**Downtime**

I get it, the main knock on Solana is the downtime.  How can you support a chain that is offline?  It’s been said before but Solana has an uptime of 99.6% lifetime.  Every major company or project ever goes through growing pains, even your bank today may suspend service for a few hours a day for maintenance.  

Also, the very reasons for that downtime isn’t just a failure from devs, it’s due to the volume of activity on the chain, which is a good problem to have.  And more importantly, Firedancer is being implemented over the next 6-12months to fix any downtime issues.

**FTX/SBF connection**

The other main reason for the hate is it was supposedly “backed by VCs and FTX” so how can it survive?  Well, Solana and FTX were connected back in 2020 when FTX was just emerging and was not a giant CEX yet.  They invested in Sol during the 5th round 2.5 years after the chain started.  With FTX going under, this only helps Solana in the future as it can distance itself from the false info and ties to being backed by one lone entity.

**Centralization**

A running joke is the D in Solana stands for decentralization.  But despite the lies spread here, Solana is more than likely far more decentralized than your favorite chain.  With a full node count of 3,474 (as of YE) and a nakamoto coefficient of 30 (Ethereum is 2).

All i’m saying is, Solana dropped 95% from its ATH, and with the devs, marketing, community, tps, low fees, it is hard to not see having a decent ROI during the next bull cycle.

I know this sub likes to kick it when it has issues but that is very infrequent and repeated so it seems far worse than it is.  Remember to do your own research and don’t take the lies you see here at face value.

The most bullish case can be argued that since this sub hates it you are guaranteed decent returns.  

Everyone wonders how it is still a nearly top 10 coin and I just explained why.

Anyone have any actual arguments against Solana other than the invalid regurgitation of downtime and centralization?  I’d love to hear it.  DYOR brothers."

8/3/23,You will become a crypto millionaire if you follow these simple steps,"First, stop waiting for the bottom just keep buying who cares if it's the top just keep buying and don't stop buying that's how you win.

SECOND, TELL ALL YOUR FRIENDS ABOUT CRYPTO, that's rule number two and don't forget it they will help you because when you have a community behind you they help you make amazing decisions just like the cryptocurrency Reddit community. For example, thanks to a fellow Redditor, I now own enough Shiba Inu that technically makes me a Shib millionaire (12$ never been a millionaire before I am so excited)

Third, make sure you enjoy all of those yummy yields off amazing exchanges like coinbase and binance. They have your best interest at heart so you totally can trust them.

Fourth, you never know when you got to sell so make sure you keep your crypto on exchanges with sell orders so you can be ready to sell the rips. 

Lastly, do not do any of these things I am just messing around, this is how you get wrecked! Especially when you tell your family and friends to buy crypto. This journey is meant to be alone until the next Bull run! 

If you have any suggestions on how to become a crypto millionaire please add them in the chat.

Edit: This is what I'm talking about, what an amazing community, now we have step 5: use leverage trading on a risky exchange.

Edit Two: Join a Telegram for the best trades.

Edit Three: Buy high, sell low.

Edit Four: Fomo at the top.

Edit Five: Giving your seed phrase to a pshing link.

Edit Six: Get a loan either from family or a bank.

Edit Seven: Start off as a billionaire.

Edit Eight: Invest in a shitcoin like UST and lock it up for several years for a high yield."

8/3/23,Passphrase advantages,"Hi all,

I have a Coldcard on order and I’m planning on moving from an old ledger nano.

Couple of questions. I’ve done a lot of reading but just wanted to clarify a few bits before moving everything.

Passphrase - As far as I read, adding a passphrase doesn’t actually increase the entropy. But it does add another layer of security in the event my seed phrase is found by unwanted parties. (See discussion in below thread).

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/p5o3jg/does_a_passphrase_increase_the_possibilities_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Therefore, if I am confident in hiding my seed phrase well, as I see it, so long as that seed phrase remains hidden (off line, no cloud storage etc) then adding a passphrase increases the complexity for family to recover funds. 

Therefore, potentially little benefit in my circumstance in adding one? Unless of course I want to create a separate wallet within that seed.

Exporting a watch only wallet - I am planning on setting up a watch only wallet on bluewallet. Is there a difference between me exporting an xpub and the .json file? There was a post on here a while back with a discrepancy of funds using the xpub. Is this down to the derivation path?

Finally, xpub, zpub, ypub - are these all in relation to legacy, segwit and native segwit derivation paths? If so, does that answer the above question whereby exporting the .json file will show all transactions? Where the xpub would only show certain derivation paths and not those with zpub etc?

Anyway, years passed and I have no idea what happened to that laptop (it was pretty shitty anyway).

I believe I still have the Bitcoin address and password stored somewhere.

Just want to know, if it’s possible to recover my Bitcoin without the original wallet (on the shitty laptop)?

What are some things being done to help facilitate the widespread adoption by improving the user experience?  I'm sure some possibilities would require some level of trust (e.g. a company storing physical seed backups, insurance, etc.), but I think that might be necessary to see that level of adoption.

I mean, I'm pretty tech savvy, but even I get a little nervous about the possibilities of an unfortunate series of evens leading to loss of funds.

8/3/23,"Inflation, Fed interest rates and black swans","Howdy all. Wanna bounce some scenarios off ya. 

As a Bitcoiner, I'm used to considering the full bredth of possible outcomes from a scenario, not just what legacy financial institutions say. 

&#x200B;

For a while, people were saying the Fed was guarantted to pivot, and in the last couple of days that assumption seems to be changing. I see two parameters (Fed interest rates and inflation) and two possible outcomes each (up or down). 

Just wanna summarise them here and see what you guys think about probability and likely effects:

1. **Interest rates up, inflation up**
   1. This would be the ""runaway"" scenario where we enter hyperinflation. If it's mild or temporary, then it's bad for Bitcoin as people to wsell to buy productive assets and bonds. Or good for Bitcoin if the whole system collapses. 
2. **Interest rates down, inflation up**
   1. This was the prevailing narrative until recently. Good for Bitcoin. Good for debtors. 
3. **Interest rates down, inflation down**
   1. Probably the least likely outcome, but it's possible the Fed does actually manage to get inflation quickly under control and things return to normal. Good for Bitcoin as everyone will be risk-on. 
4. **Interest rates up, inflation down**
   1. Very unlikely as it wouldn't be a rational decision from the Fed. 

In terms of how I position myself, Scenario 1 bothers me the most as Bitcoin would be flat or down and my mortgage would be up, and there wouldn't be much I could do about it. 

&#x200B;

What do we all think about the likely outcome, collateral damage and if/how we can protect ourselves from it?"

8/3/23,Mintlayer could be the upgrade that Bitcoin DeFi badly needs,"It is well known that most individuals are unaware that L2 chains or the DeFi ecosystem exist on Bitcoin. The primary cause of this might be because ETH ""beat them to the market,"" but it could also be due to the terrible user experience, especially for someone using DeFi for the first time.



I believe that Stacks is the DeFi platform that comes the closest to having an Ethereum-like experience, but it also has a number of risks and problems. After researching these issues and potential solutions, I noticed [Mintlayer](https://www.mintlayer.org/), an L2 that is trying to optimize user experience.



- **Atomic Swaps**

An IOU that can be redeemed on the way out is typically what you receive when sending Bitcoin from your wallet to a layer 2 chain through a bridge. This solution is criticized by many since the risk is very high. If a flaw is discovered, all of those receipts lose their redeemability.


- **No need to hold a native token to transact**


This concept is not new, but it hasn't been utilized to its full potential. It is certainly possible to onboard people to Bitcoin DeFi through L2 chains, but try explaining to a person who has never used cryptocurrency that they must pay fees in a totally different currency to move BTC across networks.

It raises the challenge and confusion of the entire process for everyone. By allowing you to pay for fees in BTC, Mintlayer solves that problem to an extent.



From everything I read about Mintlayer, it sounds like an upgraded version of Stacks. Atomic swaps are a game-changer for sure but not forcing people to use your native token for tx fees is also a big thing.

Right now, in the crypto space, AI is becoming increasingly popular due to its ability to enhance security, improve efficiency, and provide valuable insights into the behavior of users and the network. As the crypto space continues to grow and evolve, we can expect to see more innovative uses of AI in the blockchain ecosystem.

At the moment, Smart contract optimization seems like a great usecase. AI can be used to optimize smart contracts; Machine learning algorithms can analyze past contract performance and make adjustments to improve efficiency and reduce errors.

One example of this is Ocean Protocol which enables decentralized AIs with a protocol of smart contracts that can transfer answers to queries. This means that users can access data services from various providers without intermediaries or central authorities. Users can also use crypto wallets as data wallets, crypto exchanges as data marketplaces, DAOs for data co-ops, and more via DeFi composability.

Because of this, I believe we can expect a secure, privacy-preserving and immutable way to access data services. It also allows users to monetize their data in a secure and reliable manner. Finally, users can use data services without being tracked or having their data misused."
8/3/23,Countries with the most crypto-accepting businesses (according to BitcoinWide’s map),"A few years ago, we launched a map at BitcoinWide showing crypto-accepting businesses around the world. And recently, we decided to use it for a little research.

1️⃣ United States — 2,607 businesses

2️⃣ Canada — 653 businesses

3️⃣ Germany — 460 businesses

4️⃣ United Kingdom — 236 businesses

It's interesting to see that the United States is still leading the pack when it comes to crypto-accepting businesses, despite the fact that (let's be honest) a country whose legal framework is more loyal to businesses that accept crypto payments exist. 

It's not just big businesses in USA that are embracing crypto. According to a recent survey by HSB, a small business insurance provider in the US, 36% of small businesses in the country now accept some form of cryptocurrency. This is a significant increase from just a few years ago, and shows that more and more businesses are seeing the value of accepting crypto payments.

If I recall, I thought eth had to do a hard fork which seems even worse than having your token attacked while you are focused on building your mainnet product.  I guess that's some proof anything is possible, but would like to learn more about what else has survived tough setbacks.  


The post below is long, but if you're curious what prompted my question.

 **Top tier L1 tech, largely unknown, restored and revitalized, sitting at IDO prices- QANX. A chance to invest at initial funding prices when the tech is already being tested by major partners! This team has been through it all.**

The tldr version of below:    


Not financial advice, but imo Qanplatform should be the best low risk/high reward shot out there.  Still full of risk like all altcoins, but they've endured it all and people are sticking with them. While restoring their token, they've managed to partner with Alpine Esports to use their tech.  Another partnership with real name recognition is also nearing a deal, which could really set the stage for this project.   


And btw that tech includes evm compatible smart contracts with can be developed in ANY programming language.  They just released docs to let people test using Javascript and the initial feedback is great.   
 Obviously, Alpine was impressed.  Business is what will drive the project growth, not my shilling, but I still like to spread the word.  Cheers

The long story: 

I got hooked into crypto several years ago and to the best of my memory have bought and sold btc, eth, ada, algo, bonfire, micropets, equilizer, shib, ftm, doge, bone, atom, poly, lukso, matic, avax, and even pandagirl which I hope hasn't mooned since I left.

Anyway, who cares, lets get on with it.

So, I decide I like the L1 plays because obviously many have done quite well. But they all suck if I ask someone from another project- I joke, but people can poke big holes in everything out there. We dance around and see some signs of business trying to use it, but obviously businesses are not finding it super useful.

So, I learn about a project that is evm compatible and allows programming in any language. I think well that's promising and the deeper I go, the more I think it could break through to really pull in nice business adoption. They need to easily get hooked up, and they need to use their dev team who all code in something other than solidity. Real potential here.

I also see potential catalysts as the world wakes up to realizing they need to adopt advanced encryption with the quantum computer race going crazy. Do some research on this even if you could care less. Companies and governments are already moving to quantum resistant cryptography, and this is going to affect security in all systems. Big players in crypto want to push it aside because it is going to hurt the space and their value, but I assure you they are quietly trying to figure out how to minimize damage behind the scenes. And it won't be easy if not nearly impossible.

On top of that potential for folks fleeing to quantum safe coins, I hear the CTO continually motivated by a partnership in the works and product being tested. The CTO is a coder to the core, but his ability to act as a CTO is what sets him apart.

All in all, that's more than enough for me to follow along and keep adding to my stack.

So, all good- decision made. Let's ride this one out and see if I'm right.

The project is Qanplatform, which has been around a long while. It was even once quark, but they started over to ensure evm compatibility and figured out how to offer multi-language- something that no one else is going in evm. Coding in solidity is a non-starter for 99% of business as less than .07% of developers have any experience with it. Inexperience leads to mistakes.

Well, get this, a bridge being used for the token was hacked. Now granted, this is the token and not the tech that any big player cares about. But, value was hit, and people were not happy- rightfully so. However, the project does a thorough explanation of what happened and had minimized the damage, so it didn't really slow them down. But, the trolls love to say ""quantum resistant but you got hacked?!""

The big holders don't care about the token tech, which like most tokens is just leveraging existing open source code. They all stuck with the team and the value recovered, at least to where the bear market allowed. And when you see how thorough the disclosures are of what occurred, you actually gain trust in the project and the team's knowledge. Funny how that works.

So then, we finally got a long awaited audit from an IBM platinum partner- but it didn't include the virtual machine which is where the multi-language lives. That was a let down.

Then the QVM (qan virtual machine - like eth virtual machine) got released for test, but devs wanting to try out the multi-language could only use Golang because you really need docs to figure out to deploy and run contracts. I'm not really a techie, but you get the idea. Exciting news that was frustrating.

Then, it turns out the vanity address open source code that was being used in other projects for a long time had a vulnerability. Another hack took place that got qan and several other projects- unbelievable. This surely is the final straw, I can't take any more.

Honestly- I tipped my hat and said well, if this isn't restored, I'm done. No way in hell I would dig back in and invest in crypto.

Well you wouldn't believe it- they restored this damn thing while announcing they would reveal a major partnership. And by the way, the restore was delayed because the major partner had deadlines for doing proof of concept testing, so the team was NOT going to miss that.

The team and community were super pumped and the value was trading at triple where it was in October. We're back baby!

I was 100% engaged again, cause heck it is super fun when it looks like your project is going to succeed.

And the partnership is something the team rightfully is super pumped about-

ALPINE ESPORTS SIGNS QANPLATFORM AS ITS OFFICIAL BLOCKCHAIN PARTNER

It validates the tech and shows the team can form these types of partnership. The graphics and utility are awesome. And this was formed before mainnet, so that's damn impressive.

So, isn't it already mooning?! Nope, all because the way it was shared led everyone to believe it was going to be a much more well-known company... you know the one that delayed the restore process because the potential partner gave a deadline. And that the CTO was excited about for over a year.

Instead, it was Alpine. By itself, truly great. All they had to do is say, we have an awesome partner being announced which is separate from the other we've worked so hard on. Alpine would prove that this other partner isn't just talk, they really could have something big. We'd be flying right now.

Instead, it's barely above IDO pricing.

So, for an investor, the team has disappointed time and again for price momentum. They also say time and again the short term price is of little concern to them, but of course we know a growing price attracts opportunity. I'm sure they are as sick of disappointments as we are.

At the end of the day though, if it's ever going to moon, it will be because the big players like the tech and it's getting used. My annoyance that the price has gone south when it could easily be doing quite well matters little. Latecomers can come enjoy basement pricing on potentially game-changing tech.

To take a look- just google Qanplatform and start with the site. It's really well done- making it easy to get the basics or go deep if you want. The community is great- mods are super smart and there are people constantly digging into the quantum threat.  I love the vision and I think it's what the space needs, so I'm clearly sticking with it.  Good luck all and thanks for reading."

7/3/23,Why is Reddit-backed $BRICK exploding today while everything else is down?,"BRICK (marketcap $3,800,000, up 45% today) is backed by Reddit, a company with a valuation of $10 billion.  The ability to trade BRICK on mainnet from testnet was recently enabled, and has already climbed 1000% in the last 30 days.  With only a $3,900,000 marketcap, I believe this native Reddit community point token has huge potential.

**Deflationary and Capped Supply:** This is not your average shitcoin with infinite supply and zero fundamentals.

Bricks will be the currency of r/fortniteBR and other things are expected to be added other than just buying a membership and reddit coins, so a solid use case is established.

There will be a **MAXIMUM** 250 Million Bricks to ever be distributed with a bonding curve similar to bitcoin's mining distribution over time.

Every time a FortniteBR Sub user uses his Bricks to buy a Sub Membership these 500 Bricks get burned so the **deflationary** mechanism is a nice bonus.

Combine the **Capped** **Supply** with people constantly **BURNING** Bricks out of circulation to get the Sub Membership and you get a nice formula for success.

This means that over time people will earn less and less **Bricks** per month.

**Ties to Fortnite:** BRICK is backed by Reddit and is the community point system for r/FortniteBR.  Fortnite has maintained a consistent monthly active playerbase of around 80 million, with 2021 being a peak year at 83.3 million MAPs.  Fortnite has more than 390 million registered players to keep the game alive and running. According to the data provided by Active Player, in the last thirty days, the game averaged 252,600,145 peak players in a day. - [https://fictionhorizon.com/how-many-people-play-fortnite-user-growth-stats/](https://fictionhorizon.com/how-many-people-play-fortnite-user-growth-stats/)Around 85% of Fortnite players are aged 18 to 35 - [https://explodingtopics.com/blog/fortnite-stats](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/fortnite-stats)

Fortnite has grown year over year since it began in 2017.  But that’s besides the point.  It doesn’t matter what BRICK is attached to, although being attached to fortnite certainly helps as most crypto investors align with the ages that typically play fortnite.  What matters is this coin is safe from rugpulls as it’s tied to a multi-billion dollar company.  What makes it a good opportunity imo is the fact the marketcap is so low.  Taking everything into account I’ve already mentioned I think it’s a good buy right now and will only go up.

r/FortniteBR prohibits the transferring or selling of $BRICK acquired within the r/fortniteBR community.  This essentially has created two versions of $BRICK:  The internal version, found within the r/fortniteBR community, and the external tradable version found on sushi.com and RCPswap.com (Reddit Community Points swap).  This has produced the effect of locking the internal community supply as it’s unable to be sold.

**Safe:** Reddit, a privately held company, has a valuation of over $10 Billion as of 2021.  (Source: [https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621445/reddit-valuation-revenue-funding-round](https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621445/reddit-valuation-revenue-funding-round)) Reddit has even proposed that it might be worth as high as $15 Billion in 2023.

A company of this valuation has employed a very large legal department (Google: “Reddit legal department” and scroll through results to get an idea of the size) to handle all major decisions involving risk.  This extends to vetting any cryptocurrency projects it might affiliate itself with.  

Since $BRICK and $MOON are specifically affiliated with two of Reddit’s largest subreddits, these have most certainly had countless hours of research and vetting done by numerous legal department staff.  Imagine if Reddit *didn’t* fully vet $MOON and $BRICK, and something like a rugpull or exploit happened draining either of all funds.  They’d be sued on a massive scale, and would likely be found liable for damages.  

Thus, we can deduce that $BRICK and $MOON have been fully vetted, and are likely some of the safest Memecoins you could invest in today, since they are essentially backed by a multi-billion dollar corporation.

**Chart:** [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/brick](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/brick)

I believe $BRICK is extremely undervalued with a marketcap of just $3,900,000.  This is a drop in the bucket when compared to other memecoins of years past such as Dogecoin, Safemoon and Shiba Inu.  Dogecoin at its peak had a marketcap of $88.8 billion dollars.  Just for comparisons sake, if $BRICK ever gets to this marketcap, you’d see a return of 3670x your initial investment, meaning $500 invested today would turn into $1,835,000."

8/3/23,"[Proposal] Distribution - Honest and open conversation with mods of Ethtrader about delays with Multisig and changes needed, Mods to step down from multisig if not able to sign in time","Hello,

Problem:

As many of us are aware, there have been consistent and constant delays to distribution in the recent months. Moderators/multisig members do not come online, can not be reached, join and leave Discord, ignore tags and do not sign the multisig for weeks despite this being quick and easy.

Currently there are 10 people able to sign the multisig, the majority of 6 must sign to get the distro done. This is damaging to the community, damages engagement and is completely avoidable.

Solution:

- Reduce the multisig members down to an odd number so that 5/9 for example may still present a majority sign off

- Keep same number of multisig members and they commit to being able to sign as usual

- We could pay the mods more or a higher % of distribution

- Open applications for a new multisig member (not mod) 

- If distro is 7 days late, 25% of moderator donuts burnt, placed in community treasury or recirculated.

- Increase the multisig members to include new more active members so that inactive mods do not cause delays


If any mods/members wish to step down, please let it be known on this post. The problem is they don't come online at all and may not even see this post. I would like to see some sort of time limit set on this but obviously no power of that kind to say so.

Comments:

I don't care why people can't come online, I know people have lives and can't be expected to be around all the time, but these delays are unacceptable and inconsistent with explainable emergency.

Poll:
After around a week for discussion I'll create an official governance proposal where people can vote on the top two or three suggestions.

EDIT:

Multisig member is NOT the same as mod, nobody will be made a mod, not asking for someone to give up modship either.

Multisig member list:
https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/wiki/donuts/#wiki_multisig_members

Mods:
https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/about/moderators/

This is not a poll, just a proposal. Absolutely none of these are my personal suggestions. Once we have time to discuss solutions and hopefully discuss with mods and multisig members, an official poll will be created to vote for the solution."

8/3/23,ETH plummets 0.7 percent after a delayed Shanghai upgrade,"The market is trading in red today as Bitcoin, and Altcoins including Ethereum see a decline. As of writing, Bitcoin price has decreased by 0.28% in the last 24 hours. Ethereum price decreases by 0.70%.  


The global crypto market cap stands at 1.02 trillion USD, a decrease of 0.77% over the past day. The total crypto market volume in the last 24 hours decreased by 8.27% and is currently at 27.96 billion USD.  


The market cap for Ethereum is 191.34 billion USD. Moreover, trading volume decreases by 3.31% over the previous 24 hours. Each ETH token is trading for 1,563 USD, holding on to the support level of 1500.  


The Shanghai upgrade which was all set to be executed by the end of March has been pushed further to April. The launch of the Goerli testnet, which serves as a thorough dress rehearsal for the Shanghai upgrade, is currently scheduled by Ethereum’s developers to take place on or around March 14.   


According to several analysts, the token unlock feature in Shanghai is expected to allow stakers to withdraw their vested tokens from Ethereum’s proof-of-stake smart contract. This may potentially lead to a short-term sell-off event which will make the price of ETH suffer. However, some analysts at leading exchanges think that there would be minimal selling pressure during the upgrade, and ETH withdrawals would be rate-limited.   


Now during this crisis, certain parts of crypto suffered while some like gaming and DeFi have maintained success (for instance Aawe, Uniswap, etc) the question is will or can ETH go down further or will it go up? That's why I believe in this situation, Flynt Finance comes into the picture as a revolutionary portfolio management platform with effective options strategies.  


The Binance Research team believes that massive selling during and after the Shanghai upgrade was improbable since only 31% of existing stakers had a profit. The other 69% of ETH stakers were expected to continue staking and receiving rewards until the price of ETH improved."

8/3/23,It doesn't matter what crypto can do if it's not simple,"Tom Z wrote a post about a similar topic the other day, and I just wanted to toss in my two cents.

Obviously the tech matters. Fundamentals matter, because at the end of the day it HAS to work.

And while that's absolutely necessary, it's not sufficient to succeed. It needs to be dead simple. Let me take you back to the mid eighties, when everything was command line, and there was basically no reason to own a mouse.

It was technically possible to do LOTS of things on a computer. They were extremely powerful tools, even back then. You just had to devote several years of your life to learning how to make them work.

Without actually making computers more powerful, the introduction of a graphical user interface meant that all of those things that were possible, but out of reach of ordinary people were suddenly simple.  You didn't have to read the manual, you could just figure it out by clicking around. Despite his faults I think it was Steve Jobs who coined the ""grandma test"" and insisted that the original ipod only had one button.

Amazon and every other E-tailer learned long ago that every button click you put between a customer and their purchase reduces the chances they'll buy ANYTHING dramatically. We can't force people to use crypto on our terms, you have to meet them where they are.  They're lazy. They don't want to learn about your new app. They want something that makes their life easier, not harder. Even a TINY barrier to entry will keep most people away. The more seamless the better.

Function is useless without design. It is not an afterthought, it's not less important, it is just as critical as the underlying technology. If it's not easy to use it's basically pointless tech because it WILL NOT be widely adopted. Obviously, tech comes first, but I think we're at a point now that it makes a lot of sense to put more focus on ease of use, interfaces, etc."
8/3/23,The blockchain records everything forever,"Let's dig into it

* Kept forever

    Unless we implement utxo-set commitments, in which case we can discard the oldest blocks and transactions (but \/someone will keep it forever anyway; my prediction)

* At some point in time

    With the resolution of one block, on average 10 minutes

* Someone

    It has to be a conscious individual or a program acting on his behalf

* Sent something

    It can be one or more of the outputs, the others being change, who knows

* To someone

    Which may or not be the same individual

Is the blockchain pseudonymous or anonymous?

No extra funds required.  When I discovered that it cost $50 to get the physical card I opted to just skip it.  I could get the Netflix and Spotify without it and that was fine.  The loungekey benefit wasn't really something I would be using much so I skipped paying the $50.  Poked around on the app again (most of my stuff is out in the DeFi world) and saw I could just click a button and get the Jade card.  No fee.

I received the Jade card yesterday and now have the loungekey setup.   Flying out today and will be checking out the lounge.

8/3/23,Extremely frustrated with Coinbase,"It has now been over 3 hours attempting this.

&#x200B;

I received an email stating that my verification information is going to be out-of-date soon and that I need to redo it. So I logged in to the site and got met with connection issues constantly (Chrome - fully updated and no VPNs). I couldn't do anything with it and this lasted for several days before I decided to try a different browser. The other browser worked, the site loaded fine, so I went on to the page that the email gave me and uploaded a picture of my ID as requested. After that I was met with a failure to initialise my webcam (I do not have one) and cannot proceed further. I figured everything was done til today when I decided to contact support to make sure everything was fine as I had received no feedback at all to say that my upload worked, was verified or failed (phone camera is a bit on the old side).

&#x200B;

The first support person mentioned that I need to upload a selfie, but I had no option to do so, after a couple hours I tried the very painful attempt to download the app on my phone and log in - now for someone that is currently visually impaired (I had lens replacement surgery (cataract surgery) back in september and it has left me far sighted with ghosting issues and blurry vision) that was extremely difficult but I finally managed to get the app installed and logged in, only to find that there are no options whatsoever to verify with the app. So I tried support again...

&#x200B;

This time they wanted me to go to a URL on my phone that just would not work for me. I tried it in the app as well as on chrome on the phone and it would always redirect me to /home instead. So they asked me to log out on my phone and back in - an already difficult task currently. However as I went to do so I unfortunately lost access to chat as now the other browser is coming up with:  

&#x200B;

>We're having connection issues  
>  
>We're looking into it right now. Please try again later. Your funds are safe.

&#x200B;

No where in the app can I find an option to verify, the links are not opening the page and instead of redirecting me back to [coinbase.com/home](https://coinbase.com/home) and I can't find a way to verify at all.

8/3/23,Authenticator issue. Please help!,In order to sign in coinbase needs the code from my authenticator app. Authenticator app says it is disconnected. In order to reconnect it says I need to sign into coin base. Coinbase apparently will provide 0 support unless you can log in first. What a joke. Any advise would be amazing. Im frustrated
8/3/23,Recover crypto,Can anyone tell me if Chiron investigations is a real company and not a scam. Are they reputable
8/3/23,Money stuck in Coinbase,"According to Coinbase my account does not fulfill anymore the requirements to hold fiat currency and thus I am unable to sell my cryptos and withdraw money. My ID has been properly verified, my PayPal account is linked, my credit card is linked as well.


I have been exchanging tens of emails with coinbase customer service (no phone number as I am based outside of the US).
Very unhappy with the support I got so far. The only thing I got is a stupid tuto on how to sell crypto.

Ps: it’s the same problem on the web page or on the app

Case number: 14702748

Only solution I see is transferring my cryptos on some other platform and sell them there.."
8/3/23,Taxes with Coinbase Card, Hello. Every year it seems my Coinbase card creates a massive amounts of errors in the API with tax software. Does anyone have any recommendations on how to prevent this?
8/3/23,Your deposit has been initiated,"Hello,

I tried to deposit  **€108.85** on my coinbase account through a instant bank payment using IDEAL. I recieved a confirmation email saying my deposit has been initiated and when i was looking on my coinbase it doesn't show any incoming deposits or pending deposits.

The deposit was made 05-3-2023 so it has been 3 days now. But i haven't heard anything from coinbase yet. I might have seen a mail about the deposit being canceld but i might deleted it on accident. Altough its really difficult to get in touch with any actually helping support, the live support chat is just a bot that doesn't tells me anything that helps.

"" We have received your request to initiate a deposit. Upon completion of your deposit, you will receive a confirmation email. If the deposit is not completed, you will receive a cancellation notice.""

As far as i know i haven't recieved any of those emails.

I hope that anyone here could provide me with some help. I really need to know when i get that money back.

Kind regards,"
8/3/23,Please provide a document issued from the same country as the one on your profile,"  My case #14077465 was created December 2022 untill today but support coinbase promised many times but still refused to open my account. I need to know the """"why"" and """"exact when open"" reason?

What a waste of time hearing promises so many times, 1000 employees can't translate a piece of Russian text. Very frustrated and annoyed when not replying to customers"
8/3/23,I cannot figure out how to cancel recurring buy,"I have read several posts and watched this video (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FMBxZkLXC38) and when I get to where I’m supposed to be able to Vance the recurring buys there is no option to do so, as if I don’t have a recurring buy. I do though, I was charged just yesterday as I have been every month and I no longer want that. I removed my payment info…will this do the trick? It feels deceitful how difficult it is to just cancel."
8/3/23,Spent the last week going through the ID authorization process,"Long story short: I had to factory reset my phone which had Google Authenticator on it and I'm now stuck in this endless ID verification cycle. Yep, I've tried ""Sign in another way too.""

I went through the ID verification process twice, was allowed into my account for 24 hours and then wasn't even able to change my authenticator settings.

One time, I was literally allowed back in to my account and I received an email at the same time, saying my ID was still being reviewed lol. I'm stuck in this cycle of ID verification and then bots replying to me with some generic response over email.

The silliest thing is I don't even have any money in there, I want to get into my account to put money in! I can't imagine the stress if you had a significant amount of money entrusted to Coinbase.

Think I'll sign up for Binance or Kucoin, I just needed to transfer Crypto for a job I was applying for."
8/3/23,Coinbase bug,"So I'm trying for a week now to get back into my account since my old phone number got deactivated and I have a new one. So I'm trying to change it. For that I have to go through the ID verification process but after my ID gets verificated and entering the secure code I get the message that I need to change my password and instantly getting signed out. In the first 5-6 support messages they told me it was user error till someone from support replied it is a bug. Already tried multiple ID verifications and attempts to get back into my account, each time waiting 2-3 days till it's done just to get to nowhere. How is this still not fixed I'm asking myself. Maybe someone here has more clue than the support that answers 1-2 a day with no helpful information. 

And please if anyone has a better alternative to CoinBase where I can quickly start purchasing coins through my banking without too much fuss, PM me, please."
8/3/23,Can anyone get Coinbase to actually do their job?,
8/3/23,This is the most inept service I've ever used. Can't even get support without constantly being forced to do KYC?,"I've had ETH stuck in a vault account that I cannot remove. About half a year ago, I was told to do KYC (driver's license front and back) - which in my opinion is an extreme violation of privacy, who knows where those images are being stored, the level of security being used (this is the same company that dropped the ball on thousands of users' name/address/phone not long ago), what's being done with facial recognition, who they are being shared with...I realize this is becoming more common, it's why I ditched Kraken years ago, but I digress... regardless, I submitted the driver's license as instructed, and my ticket was shortly closed after several days of no response. Responding to the closed ticket resulted in no response. I deeply regretted sending the images of my license because they're now on some cloud server for an eternity.

A lot of things happened in real life for me and I had this issue on the back burner. Fast forward to today, they are now refusing to assist me unless I do KYC again plus a clear shot of my face. This is insanity. I could just sign up and buy Bitcoin on numerous other trading apps without having to go through ANY of this nonsense. But in this case, all I'm trying to do is regain access to something I already own.

Coinbase is SO hard to get in touch with. The tickets take days and days to be answered. The live chat: in just 15 minutes I went through 3 reps, because they kept dropping out and being replaced with someone new who started all over again with ""how can I assist you today?"" and I had to start my whole story from square one each time. With the revenue this company makes, they can't do better than this clown show?

I suppose I can kiss 2 ETH away because I refuse to keep submitting KYC again and again, and now a high res picture of my face? This company can't do what literally every other company does, and send 1-5 cents to my bank account and verify it that way, or send a postcard to my physical address, or call the number attached to my account?  

I realize some might think this is ridiculous while others might understand why this bothers me, but for this to *now* be the *only way to even get a 2nd sentence out of a support rep* is the epitome of bad business. 

tl;dr: My ETH is being held hostage and the only way to get it out is to send an obscene level of privacy invading sensitive data to this company with no alternative."
8/3/23,Why do I have to wait to transfer?,I purchased BTC 4 days ago but it says I still have 2 days to wait to send it. I’ve been using Coinbase for years. Is this something new? It was an ACH from an account I’ve used before. I thought this should be almost instant. Anyone else have this?
