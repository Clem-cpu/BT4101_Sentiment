2/3/23,I played Gods Unchained for 5 months so you don't have to. Here is a detailed review on its play 2 earn from a f2p player's perspective,"Apart from posting here, clicking on brave ads there is also an option to play a few play 2 earn games. Not many are out there that are kinda viable. Gods unchained is a decent one in that regard.

I started as a complete f2p player 1 year ago.. farmed some gods back then and stopped playing. In september play 2 earn was announced and I had \~$20 worth of gods in IMX wallet.

Now that p2e was announced I wanted to try cheap and fast deck just to test the viability of p2e.

How does p2e work:

* First 10 games you play are counted towards p2e.
* The higher rank you are and the more you win in those 10 games the more gods you earn.
* Card quality also matters but if you have full meteorite deck there's no point in going more than that

So the goal was

1. Play 10 games every day
2. Win as many games as possible
3. Make games as quick as possible

Solution - effective aggro deck

As much as I love control decks .. games can last 20 minutes or more.. with aggro deck you you are pretty much done in 5 minutes. Having played MTG for over a decade helped me in quickly assessing the cards/decks so it went smoothly.

I made a $20 aggro war deck and within 3 days I was in mythic (highest rank)

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Results**

Here is the screenshot of last 10 days of rewards:

[Rewards from last 10 days of playing. ](https://preview.redd.it/lpvcujxzk9la1.png?width=1123&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dbd4bdb5768a3609f82a0a9f3bd76df71896a6e0)

On average a mythic/diamond player can earn 5-6 gods per day. GODS is \~$0.3 so it ends up being $1.5 - $2 per day. There is a myth that you can't get to mythic as a f2p... absolutely not true. The most expensive decks are control decks... aggro eats through them. (source: 5 months of grind)

On top of that you have weekend ranked which can earn you some additional cards that you can sell on marketplace. There are occasional events that can also drop you some cards.

After 5 months of f2p playing here is total worth of my collection (0.28 ETH), along with some of the most valuable cards (some of them were a lucky drop from events, some were traded for)

[Most valuable cards after 5 months of every day grind \(Total collection worth \~0.28 ETH\)](https://preview.redd.it/j7f54xwtl9la1.png?width=1604&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9622136f737399bf96a386b42cb9a8c2e0751df1)

I still play aggro war only (1h per day) and sell most of other cards.

NFT marketplace is preety smooth. It is on L2 so there is no gas fee, only a marketplace fee. So pretty much any GODs you earn you can spend there trading. If you are patient and like trading cards you can squeeze a little bit of money there as well.

Conclusion:

* **Overall it's not much ($50 per month if you are a decent player).**
* **Unless you like the game I wouldn't recommend it. If you are into TCGs however by all means dig into it.. there are also lots of free tournaments with nice rewards. Also you can also join a clan and borrow the cards for a top tier deck.**"

Let's do the math and see how much the total supply of LUNC just dropped.

previous total supply - 6,869,800,000,000

new total supply - 6,861,000,000,000

 If CZ keeps burning at this rate LUNC will be back to it's previous ATH in in a few centuries 

Maybe somebody needs to send help over to the LUNC community."
2/3/23,"The HEX ponzi cultists strikes back: Their YouTube influencers mocked our comments and the Reddit community wrote long counter posts, calling us uninformed and a great source for inverse trading","# Brief history

Over the recent couple of weeks, there were three major posts here that called out HEX for being a ponzi and a scam and highlighted that its founder Richard Heart is a known scammer and fraud.

# The HEX Reddit community posted responses and called us out.

**One user made a long counter-argument post, trying to discredit some of information here**. This was a surprising honorable attempt that got some adequate replies. There was indeed some wrong information in the comments here regarding the staking mechanism and that it is optional.

**Yet HEX is still a ponzi (3.7% inflation, 38% APY) and an insane amount of the supply is with the founder, who is a known scammer.** They even admitted the issue that Richard Heart is dodgy and holds so much supply -some say about 90%- and no one knows how much exactly:

This is what I'm seeing during the last **3 months**:

* Audit ""fails"", insufficient funds, ""bank run""
* Paxos' SEC lawsuit, BUSD is a security
* Kevin O'leary, National TV, BNB has no value
* Binance.US moves ""big"" funds to CZ
* CZ used costumers funds for hedge
* Withdrawal of BUSD, ""bank run""
* What's next?

Binance didn't stopped working during that period, trading, withdrawals, daily volume, are look normal for the state of the economy, especially compared to other exchanges.

BNB as a chain has a lot of thing going on, from the stats, it looks like one of the most active chains, the price stayed ""stable"" during all those 3 months. The ecosystem seems to grow month by month.

As it seems nothing changed on the development of BNB Chain and Binance CEX seems to continue working like usual. BUSD was ""canceled"", so no more is being made by Paxos, only it gets burned, during withdrawals. Why all those news didn't have much impact on prices? Did everyone who was getting affected by FUD already left the space, during the FTX dips? I would like to hear the opinions from the biggest community in this space.

2/3/23,Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin cannot attain the legal status of a payment instrument: IMF,"The road to Bitcoin becoming an official legal payment instrument has been full of failures. Organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) explained their stance in their latest report. ""No"" to BTC as a legal payment instrument, ""Yes"" to regulating the space.

Bitcoin as a legal payment instrument has had many scenarios going both ways. One was in favor of the cause, while the other was quite the opposite.

Ultimately, the laws and regulations of individual countries determine the ability of Bitcoin to be recognized as a legal payment instrument. Some countries, such as El Salvador, have passed laws recognizing Bitcoin as a legal payment instrument. But since then, it has encountered obstacles on its path from regulators.

# Bitcoin adoption in different regions

A legal payment instrument refers to a country's currency law recognizing assets to be exempted from debt. While Bitcoin is currently not accepted as a legal payment instrument, it can be used as a means of exchange for goods and services in some countries.

For example, Bitcoin is considered property for tax purposes and is not a legal payment instrument in the United States. However, it can still be used to purchase goods and services. It is worth noting that laws regarding legal payment instruments are usually enacted by governments to ensure a standard currency for transactions and regulate the money supply.

Bitcoin operates outside of traditional government and banking systems as a decentralized digital currency. In doing so, Bitcoin questions the idea of a legal payment instrument. As the use and acceptance of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies continues to grow, countries are recognizing them as legal payment instruments. El Salvador was the first to accept Bitcoin as a legal payment instrument. Similarly, the Central African Republic became the first African nation to make Bitcoin legal tender.

However, adopting Bitcoin as a legal payment instrument has raised several questions from various regulatory bodies, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last year.

# Growing debate over Bitcoin's use

Reiterating the same stance, the IMF, on February 23, published a document highlighting various reasons for not accepting cryptocurrencies such as BTC as a legal payment instrument. The report ""Elements of Effective Policies for Crypto Assets"" contains nine principles relating to macro-financial, legal and regulatory, and international coordination issues.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/aadx0z3m2ala1.jpg?width=850&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=203b668131254bc9357e454a3afba534af3b4362

We can read in it:

>""By adopting frameworks, policymakers can better mitigate the risks associated with cryptocurrency assets while harnessing the potential benefits of the technological innovations they enable.""

# Obvious reasons not to choose Bitcoin

Overall, Bitcoin does have several drawbacks in the race to become a legal means of payment. Firstly, the volatility of Bitcoin's price may make it difficult to use as a reliable means of exchange. Its value can fluctuate sharply in a short period of time, creating significant uncertainty for users and merchants.

Secondly, the lack of a central authority controlling the issuance and circulation of Bitcoin may make it susceptible to abuses such as money laundering, terrorism financing, and other illegal activities. This could undermine the integrity of the financial system and pose a risk to global financial stability.

Conversely, according to the analytics firm Messari, fiat currency is used for money laundering 800 times more than cryptocurrency.

Thirdly, limited acceptance of Bitcoin as a legal means of payment means that it may not be widely accepted in transactions, leading to challenges in using it as a medium of exchange. Nevertheless, the cryptocurrency community disagrees with MFT's narratives about cryptocurrencies. For example, one user tweeted:

https://twitter.com/cryptonator1337/status/1628836277587001347?s=20

Another person presented a viewpoint that sheds light on countries accepting BTC regardless of censorship.

Meanwhile, Twitter user and Bitcoiner Carl B Menger expressed happiness that countries are independent of the IMF and that they can ""do what's best for their citizens.""

https://twitter.com/CarlBMenger/status/1628944377337810944?s=20 

  
According to Dmitry Ivanov, CMO of the cryptocurrency payment ecosystem CoinsPaid, who spoke to BeInCrypto, he took a relatively neutral approach to the situation.

# Pros and cons to consider

In an email conversation, Ivanov said that the IMF recently recommended that regulators impose significant restrictions on digital currencies to protect monetary sovereignty. The fund also advised countries to prevent cryptocurrencies from being granted legal tender status in what appears to be a growing trend today.

>""This position contradicts the dogmas of financial freedom and negates the entire concept of decentralization that digital currencies such as Bitcoin aim to institutionalize.""

The IMF's goal is clear: to centralize cryptocurrency and control it like the US dollar. Implementing this will help create a framework for taxation, eliminate legal risk, and supervise and monitor cryptocurrency market participants.

While it may raise the entry threshold, it is beneficial when viewed holistically. ""It cleans up the market from scammers and increases investor protection.""

>""While Bitcoin's volatility remains its biggest downside, we can agree that the cryptocurrency has reached an age where it can transition into the mainstream.""

# Can cryptocurrencies be banned?

The simple answer is no, and IMF representatives are on the same side. But the sector needs regulatory work or means to remove scammers and dishonest individuals. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva told Bloomberg that it is better to regulate cryptocurrencies.

https://twitter.com/crypto/status/1629355929849278473?s=20   


Georgieva later issued another statement indicating that while the IMF may be interested in digital assets, it may be strict in terms of rules. Georgieva noted:

>“If regulation is slow and digital assets become a higher risk for consumers and a potential threat to financial stability, the option of banning them should not be taken off the table.”

Overall, regulatory bodies are indeed taking steps to regulate the decentralized space. The Financial Stability Board (FSB), International Monetary Fund (IMF), and Bank for International Settlements (BIS) will [provide documents](https://www.g20.org/content/dam/gtwenty/gtwenty_new/document/1st%20FMCBG%20Chair%20Summary.pdf) and recommendations establishing standards for global cryptocurrency regulatory frameworks.

Only time will tell whether these regulatory measures will help the cryptocurrency sector."

**The big question is - what does this mean for the Crypto Industry:** and does the failure of Silvergate have fall out that will spread? All of the largest crypto exchanges have connections with Silvergate: Coinbase, FTX, Binance, Kraken - all have/had relations with Silvergate.

Lots of Crypto Firms and Industries have connections with Silvergate as they're a huge behind the scenes player. The potential that this company doesn't have enough funds to meet it's debt obligations or the reserves of their clients is a huge concern. A major player that connects the top players in the crypto industry is at risk of complete failure, and it's not clear if they have enough assets to stay afloat or meet their current obligations.

Edit: They are also a player in the world of USDC handling both Issuance and Redmption. Source

TLDR: Silvergate is a bank and has been a massive player in crypto since 2013. Since they were caught in the FTX collapse they have been bleeding money. Rumors are currently speculating that they will completely fail. They are players in literally all the top exchanges, and other market makers like USDC. The question is, what else will fall if Silvergate falls?"

What a long way we have come…","I think once again we all have been looking at the charts too closely and too precisely but instead we should zooming out and instead not focus on the simple price metrics but on the general mass adoption Crypto has went through. And more importantly how this has been increasing, maybe even exponentially.

The best way to show that is if you just look a few years back to 2020 or even the early bull market of 2021, back then just a few grocery stores accepting Bitcoin was seen as massive news or some random companies buying Bitcoin was hyped up as hell.

Look around now, we are getting news of one of the biggest Payment giants accepting Crypto, the biggest grocery store chains in many countries accepting Crypto, the biggest bank having to offer Crypto for their clients and the biggest companies implementing blockchain systems. All that on a daily and weekly basis.

The same or even bigger adoption than during the last bull market, only difference is that we are in a bear market now that this has kind of become the norm, everyone is used to hearing that news about Crypto now.

Still we would not forget that adoption always has the same impact nonetheless of the hype or not."

2/3/23,"Feels like another slow descent back down is ahead of us for a while, enjoy the cheap buys as they come.","Something tells me we have *at least* some more weeks, if not months, possibly years of downturn ahead of us. The global economy is still shaky. Inflation is out of control everywhere. Supply shortages and the tightening of belts are going to keep pressing crypto down. Crypto is still mostly a luxury investment that people with spare money are loading into. With that disposable income decreasing all around the world, a new frontier investment like crypto is going to feel the pinch.

The positive side to this is those of us who are DCA'ing are going to get more bang for our buck. I think the vibe right now is still ACCUMULATE. Happy hunting out there!"

Some potential options could be:

- On-chain Governance participation 
- Staking
- Yield Farming 
- P2E gaming
- Simple Stacking (DCA strategy, stacking Sats or other crypto)
- NFTs (trading, collecting, potential utility of a certain NFT)
- degen activities (leveraged plays, doggy token trading, riding hype trains to $0)
- technology (you enjoy the technology, and are having fun watching as the space evolves)
- Development, as in, you are a developer and are currently building
- you’re a node operator, miner or validator
- ***moon farming (edited in by popular demand)***

I feel like his covers a lot of ground, but if you have something to add, please comment. I’m really curious to hear from the ones who have stuck around.

Me, I have been very active in on-chain governance and enjoy Governance drama, it’s very entertaining. For those of you who are involved in Cosmos Governance, you know there is no shortage of drama in Cosmos Hub governance. I find it worth it though. Cosmos and the Cosmos IBC ecosystem have some cool things being built and good features and software updates needing voted on.

I have also been finding new projects to stake tokens to earn some tokens passively. I’m newly staking my DOT, AVAX and am going to branch out to stake some other tokens like ADA as well. Would love to find some others to add to the list, so I’m open to suggestions. I’m heavily involved in staking in the Cosmos ecosystem, ATOM and OSMO are my biggest positions, but I have multiple others staked that I have gotten some smaller positions in or had airdropped and just staked rather than selling. 

The main thing that takes my time now a days is trying to understand the different architectures between blockchains like Avalanche, Polkadot, Cardano, Solana, Hedera, Algorand, ICP and a few more. It’s a lot to take in, and requires a ton of repeated information, since I’d say I’m a pretty slow learner, but I’m persistent and it’s kept me entertained and investing throughout the bear market.

Interested to hear what this subs main sources of interest, or motivation have been?"

There's a post that's been going around on a bunch of cryptocurrency subreddits in the last 24 hours

A somewhat legit game website, an associated Twitter, and sometimes even somewhat legit looking articles talking about an NFT based game coming out from Square Enix

2/3/23,It happened to me! My phone with my wallets was destroyed!,"Hello!

So, it happened to me. My cell phone, which is where I have a few wallets, including MetaMask, CB Wallet, my Reddit vault, etc. was destroyed. So, no longer could I get to my crypto by typing in a PIN or opening an app. 

I got a new cell phone and got my seed to my MetaMask and typed it in and boom, my wallet was restored. I did the same thing for my CB Wallet, and that worked too. 

Then I tried my Reddit Vault. I typed in my seed but the vault wouldn't reinstall. Now, I do have some fake seeds hidden in certain places and I may have typed in one of the fake seeds or an old seed. The app indicated I would need either my password or my seed. Since apparently I had typed in either a fake seed or a seed to an older version of a vault, I tried my password and my vault reappeared. 

There are 2 points/issues with this post:

1. Make sure you have your seed phrases stored safely! I did and I was able to restore a few wallets easily (such as MetaMask and CB Wallet). I have one wallet with about $10 that I haven't located my seed phrase for yet. I believe I know where that is, but it will take me some time to get to it, so I'm not concerned. But, because I did have my seed phrases, I am NOT posting about how I lost all of my crypto. I'm posting about how I easily recreated my wallets on a new cell phone.
2. It seemed that I was able to restore my Reddit vault with only my password. Is this accurate or do you think it restored because I had entered a seed phrase already and when I added the password the combo restored it?  If you can restore your Reddit vault with only your password, doesn't that mean anyone who can guess your password can access your Reddit vault?

Thanks!"
2/3/23,If Someone Knew My Seed Phrase But Not The Order Of The Words Could My Wallet Be Compromised?,"This is something I've been wondering about for a while.  I currently have a seed written down on piece of paper stashed away place for safe keeping only accessible me.  It's in my will that it gets turned over to my daughter if I die.   Lately I've been wanting to make a more permanent record.  I've seen how others have done metal stamps and such.  It want something that's not going to degrade over time.  

I have a friend with an engraving machine and I've been thinking of asking him to engrave some tiles with my seed phrase on it.  Now I'm not an idiot.  As much as I trust him there's no way I'm going to just hand him my seed phrase.  But what if I asked him to do it one word at a time by giving him the words in a random order.  I could aerially assemble them into the correct order later.  

So my question is quite simple.  if someone knows the words of my 24 word seed phrase but not the correct order is there any reasonable possibility that it could be compromised?  I feel like it would be a a 1 in a gazillion chance  but I honestly have no idea."

2/3/23,"Crypto often feels a bit like gambling (or a lot like gambling) to me. And like any other vice, it can get out of hand. What do you do to keep from feeling like a total junkie?","Basically title. First, a disclaimer: My portfolio is a humble one. I’m not breaking the bank with my crypto dabbling. However, I know some here have a lot more play money (or work money if it’s their job) to throw around then I do, so the stakes are higher in those cases. I don’t invest more than I’m comfortable losing. Like when I sit down at a poker table, I just assume I’m losing that money, and pleasantly surprised when I don’t.  

That being said, despite my small bags, I often find myself checking prices many times a day, for fomo reasons. Does anyone here ever like, take a break? Or play a game like the times when we are at work, and try our best not to look at the clock? I feel like doing so is the antithesis of responsible crypto investing since things can happen fast in this space. Not being vigilant can be very costly. 

I tend to get really into my hobbies, and when I’m being honest with myself, it’s not fair to my family. I’ve really tried to rein it in as much as I can. But I feel the dragon on my back, and I know I’m spending more and more time looking at my phone. My Pokemon obsession has even taken a back seat. I’ve replaced single shopping for cards on eBay with crypto and NFTs.

2/3/23,Flying banners and burning tokens- a bright future for Moons?,"Hello Mooners,

recently I've made my first great (lucky) decision: buying some (not enough, as it shows). Soon after that banners were introduced and since then we can see them climb steadily. 

Some Mooners seem to take profits (which I think isn't very smart considering what's happening):

https://preview.redd.it/jm9hgdt3kdla1.png?width=871&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1ea532fd9389809ff74ed0c4d00102e71c366248

As you can see, price is jumping before a banner appears - for obvious reasons. For a low-cap token like Moons, 7,000 Moons burned is very much. Right now, compared to Bitcoin, 7,000 Moons is an equivalent of \~$30M in Bitcoin (**that's more than 1,280 BTC**). Something most investors don't realize: a certain percentage of the daily trading volume will be sold later - not so burned tokens. They are gone, which has an even greater impact on the market.

So, where will that take us? There might even be another exchange listing Moons (pure speculation, but it's likely to happen). What do you expect to happen now? Are you taking profits? 

By the way, I really love this sub, because it's not about a single project. We all know what happens to subs like Bitcoin or Safemoon. You taught me so much on this sub, I'll open a bottle of czech Budweiser and toast to you guys!"
2/3/23,Anything can happen! Can your crypto help your family?,"Couple years ago I had a friend who had 3/4 of a btc, and a few eth. Probably 60-70k cad worth of crypto. He suddenly died on a camping trip we were on.

To this day his parents or family have no access to that crypto. To be fair, we’re young and don’t think about that sort of thing.

The point is that if you have any significant amount of crypto, unless you want to become a burn wallet, it’s important to have a plan for your family to access your crypto in case of emergency. 

Put instructions in a safety deposit box, tell your parents, set up instructions in a will. Have the conversation with your loved ones. 


Tl;dr let your family know what to do if something happens to you"
2/3/23,"Start treating crypto ads like all other ads, just ignore them. People do ads just cause they are paid to do so, not cause they like or care about something they promote. It is the same way with promoting food, phones, cars or crypto.","I don't get why people are mad or suprised cause another celebrity promote some shitcoin. It is just another product they are paid promote. They get money, they say written text, they get paid and that's all. Benefit of being famous (or just working in ads, cause many actors in ads are average people that went on casting to earn few bucks). They do it cause they are paid that's all, nothing more. In 90% situations they don't use product they promote, they probably never even heard of it. In 100% ads even if someone use product, all what they say is a lie,  cause it is ad, not honest opinion. Ads are supposed to be only positive, no one do negative ads.

Celebrities or actors most likely don't even checked details or approved it,  their menagers do. They personally have no idea what they promote, they don't use it or care. That's how ads work. Blaming them for your own financial decisions is naive, they didn't force anyone to buy anything, you are just naive enough to fall for one of oldest marketing traps.

Pepsi once promised in TV ad many prizes, even figher  jet  if you get enough  points. One guy bought enough points to get a jet, pepsi told him it wasn't real offer, just a joke. He sued them and lost cause judge told no one normal would believe they can get fighet  jet from tv ad.

It is marketing, most of you would promote some fastfood or car brand or crypto too if you would be paid enough. It is not responsibility of person hired to do an ad  to know if it is legit, they aren't finance expert, or car expert or food nutrionists. Just ignore it like you do with all other ads. Only fools believe ads.


If some  guy in  tv tell you he love hamburgers  and eat them every day, drink daily three bottles of certain soda or tell he drive only one german brand of car you aren't angry that it is lie and eating this unhealthy fastfood or soda will be bad and car brand is not actually best one. You also aren't mad that doctor in tv ad is just hired actor not real doctor. So stop also  giving attention to some influencer that promote some shit."

2/3/23,In 10 or 15 years people will treat YOU as OG crypto investor. And only from you depend if it will be something to be proud of or just wasted opportunity.,"We glorify people that were in crypto in 2011, 2012 or 2013. We think they were probably lucky and smart to be in crypto so early. We are jealous they had opportunity back in times most of us had no idea BTC even exist. And first question we all would like to know is if they are rich yet. If answer is yes, we imagine them as  ourselves in the future, if answer is no, we say something nice, but inside we think they wasted huge opportunity and probably they is something wrong with them. Even donkey would be rich after being in crypto for over 10 years,  would he? Statistically by simply buying BTC in 2013 and ETH in 2015 and hilding with current prices they should have at least few hundreds thousands or millions is they were at least semi serious about crypto.  Ofc world is not  black and white, but still  years in crypto, three bullmarkets with no profits are red flag, not everyone can be even average investor..


In 5, 10 or 15 years the same thoughts people will have about us. We have opportunities people will dream about one day. We complain about buying BTC for $15k or $20k, but if BTC will cost $300k in few years people will think we were stupid today to not buy. Everyone here have their dreams or goals and a lot of time to achieve them. Ask yourself if in 10 years you want to be successful investor and thank yourself that you invested in crypto or you will be salty you fooled around and didn't use probably biggest opportunity in your life. Will you be in 10 year be rich guy that will proudly say I invested in crypto, like today stock brockers or guys that invested in internet in early 2000's can say or you will try to forget cause it will hurt too much you wasted opportunity and never get another.


Today is the day you should think about your crypto journey in 5, 10 or 15 years. In 10 years it will be 10 years too late to change past. Best day to invest crypto was 10 years ago, next best day is now. We are still in bear market, prices are low, no FOMO yet. In 10 or 15 years you will be treated as OG crypto investor, but your OG decisions are made ""today""."
2/3/23,Have you ever taken profits yet? Are you in the red or green overall?,"Personally, I am about even still when it comes to cryptocurrency.  A couple years ago I bought ETH at around 1600 and then out of an emergency, I had to cash it out when it was around 3500.  I made a sweet profit because of that, and I needed the money because my landlords evicted me so they could upgrade the place and make more money.  I was bummed because of course it continued to go up to about 4500 after I sold.  But then when I could finally afford to buy some more it was at like 3200.  Then I had to sell again around 1500, of course that was a loss.  So all in all, I am still breaking even overall.  But I can tell you that both times I had to cash out, it was a life-saver.  This is all money I would have normally spent on eating out, which came to a stop during the Pandemic and I have not returned to.  

I guess I could have kept it all in savings and been about in the same place now, but what fun is that?  

Have you taken out profits?  Has it helped you in those times?  Overall are you negative, positive, or breaking even?"

* Learning about Crypto during a massive bullrun. The excitement, and definitely greed, caused me to buy plenty of shitcoins without proper knowledge. Turned  into a very expansive mistake during the following crash.
* Taking financial advice from random shills/youtubers & not doing proper research.
* Not learning about staking sooner.
* Diversifying my Portfolio too much. Instead of picking 4-5 well established projects, I spread my money too thin and took too many risks will lesser known projects.
* LUNA. This one goes without saying...

2/3/23,"When it comes to investing in crypto, listen to yourself, and yourself only.","Im not rich with crypto.  I also didn't go broke from it.  I did ok.   

Some suggest that my success in investing in the coin was due to luck or good timing, but in reality, it was a conscious and well-informed decision on my part. Luck with the time or coin would be randomly picking an option out of a hat without any research or randomly picking a date to invest.

That said, here's a quick explanation of why you shouldn't be listening to what others say, and rely solely on your confidence, and gut feelings.

#Not everyone is comfortable with making their own choices. 

Some people rely on news to make decisions, even if the information has been available for decades. They may not be comfortable exploring new options. For example, some still believe cholesterol tests are the most accurate for heart disease, while C-reactive protein tests have been available for 40 years and are just as accurate if not more accurate in some circumstances.

But since cholesterol is advertised more, that's all they really know, and if you go back and say, *Fk the cholesterol test, I feel better with a c-reactive protein test*, they might think you are crazy or foolish.     Because they don't understand. 

There will be people that simply don't know what the FK you are getting into.  So listening to how they feel is as good as being shilled into a shitcoin you don't know about.

##Not everyone is comfortable with taking chances

You might have a relative, a co-worker, a neighbor or a friend like this, and Even though these same people will happily blow money on lottery losing $1,000 over a year or 4 years time, they did it in tiny fractions of $2-$5 a week.  So it seems not much at all but when they find out you are making the choice to put down $500 on a coin and hold it for 4 years...   That seems crazy.  

*Hey man, you better be careful, you could lose it all*.

Why? Because they only understand what they did. So it's not recommended to listen to how they feel.  They don't have any experience in what you are doing.

##Some people are afraid to give up their safety net.

15 years ago, I quit a secure job with good benefits to live in another country with a woman I met. Despite doing thorough research and realizing I could get a higher paying job with no benefits and buy my own insurance, a coworker and even some friends and family thought I was INSANE!


*You just can't get up and go...you have a job*

Luckily I ignored their unfounded FUD and did it anyway.

 Now i speak another language, have visited 48 countries and made friends all over the place that are happy to see me and help me out anytime I travel abroad.
I can happily take a vacation anywhere in Europe and with the knowledge gained, I easily spend half the cost for twice the experience as anyway else attempting the same thing.

I even get FUD about doing things while I'm on vacation.

I would say ""we are gonna rent a car and explore instead of relying on taxi all the time"". 

FUD
*You don't want to rent a car, and drive in that country, I heard people drive crazy there* 

Wait what? You finally had the guts to visit a new country and you're afraid to do normal things over there?  People drive crazy over here.   Just pay attention to the FKIN road and learn basic signs.     If I listened to that even, i wouldn't have found all these hidden lesser known gem areas.

But I'm the crazy person with ""Wild new ideas nobody every heard of"" even though the very existence of the country I'm from heavily relied on people exploring new lands, and human history shows people have been exploring new lands since the start of humanity.     But they never did that thing you did, so to them....it's ludicrous.  You are foolish. 

Don't listen investment advice from people like that.  You'd have the same luck listening to a crackhead. 


##self employment

For reasons above, you can easily see why starting you own business is INSANE, and unheard of to many people.

Nevermind the very reason why they even have a job heavily relies on people who decided to start their own business.  Just ignore that fact like it never happened and continue on with  for shit pay increases every year.   

*But but....you have to work hard running a business*

Huh? What?  You are working hard anyway. The FK are you talking about?    

Sure, starting a business isn't easy. But moving up the ladder at a job isn't easy either.  You have to deal with so much heart ache sometimes and constantly be stressed at times. 

It may take you YEARS.  But you'll never see it come to fruitation if you don't take the chance.   I'd rather take the chance then to be looking down the barrel of middle aged burnout regretting I never tried.   Fk type of life is that? 


Just do your own research, and If you feel confident about your choices...  Listen to yourself.  The majority of successful people who didn't grow up rich or receive an inheritance did this very exact thing.   

That's all, and this is advice."

Cuy Sheffield, Head of Crypto at Visa, shared some interesting insights on stablecoin adoption in retail payment use cases. He used on-chain data and created a base-level proxy for payments by assigning a <$200 value heuristic to the on-chain transaction data.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2xobdfjit9la1.png?width=815&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f98fe45a33c0b79d387af69e6544cfcbb65fe15e

According to his analysis, Tron dominates stablecoin adoption in emerging markets, which may come as a surprise to some in the West. The monthly active users (MAUs) sending stablecoin payments on Tron are particularly high. Sheffield noted that this trend was also observed by Messari Crypto in their Q4 State of Tron Report.

However, when it comes to growth, the rapid expansion of Ethereum layer 2's and side-chain activity cannot be ignored. The MAUs sending stablecoin payments on these chains have increased by over 500% YoY.

Reason I ask is because I find it very hard to believe that people, who lost money during last bull run, would FOMO in meme coins... on top of that most people that, somewhat, heard about meme coins already know that most of the ""traders"" lost money gambling on them

Sure, there will always be people that will keep trading meme coins but, I don't know..., vast majority of people have probably already realized that most meme coins die out very quickly while, thanks to survivor bias, we only hear about successful ones which are small minority...

2/3/23,Application of blockchain technology by solving real world problem,"This got me thinking the other day.

As a sysadmin I spend some time taking care and tracking my assets warranties.

Servers, laptops, desktops, switches, access points, routers, mobile phones, list goes on and on.

All of them have service tag that you can use to lookup the details about device and warranty status on manufacturer portal.

If this information would be put on blockchain by manufacturer at the start of asset lifecycle, building and app that can query and pull necessary info for each device would be trivial.

App could be as simple as scan service tag with mobile phone and info about device and warranty are retrieved and displayed on the phone.

There would be no need for each manufacturer to build their own database and open the API for others to retrieve this info. It's great application of blockchain technology.

Now me and my team are using proper tool that automatically gather this and a lot of other info about devices via network (Lansweeper) so I'm not really in need of such solution. But that would still be beneficial for anybody who does have access to tools professionals use.

Idk why anyone would be even suprised criminal scum hate something that made them lose power and money, something that bring freedom and equality to people. Ofc they will be afraid and hate it. Crypto for them is like garlic for vampires like holy sword for the undead. And it will smash them much harder than we can imagine. They try to stop it, cause fear and doubt. But it doesn't mean much, they can ban it or stop it. Just slow it down.

Crypto is bit like french revolution. Back then they cut heads of rich and corrupted, today we cut their financial tentacles. Ways change, but goal stay the same. Financial freedom, equality and better living conditions for average people with less wealth differences between rich and everyone else.

If anything we should rather be for INF and World Bank being disbanded than want their approval. Those organizations have too much blood and ruined lives on their account. They put third world countries in debt, assasinate leaders that don't cooperate with the help of CIA, steal land and resources for ""free"" when countries can't pay impossible to pay debts. They do it for almost 70 years (since 1950's), it is nothing new, not even a secret or conspiracy theory just hard facts. If people like that say crypto is the problem, then ask yourself why would you care what they think."
2/3/23,The Suffering of The Crypto Holder,"I DCA, it goes down. I DCA again, it goes down again. I dont have emotions anymore. I feel like I am in the deep ocean where I dont see nothing but feel the cold water. I look up and see nothing.

As btc goes down, the redness I see starts to mix up with the evening sun. As I look up at the sky I say to myself, why did I enter to crypto in the first place?

I am laying on my bed wondering and pondering when will this crypto suffering end as 2 years has passed. The bright moon I see gives me hope. To the future days where we will moon. 

I have now closed my eyes, trying to cope with my losses. I am waiting for a greener day, a spring, a dawn with full of gains… I sleep and fall into this deep slumber. 

In my dream I see everything mooning, its like a paradise, its too good to be true I say, as I look at my coins and I see 100x gains. I wake up with excitement, a hope, a light from the above just to realise the pain in my investments.

Investing is scary and they don’t teach us what we need to know in school. 

Some of us get lucky and we find somebody in our lives, a mentor, who gives us a nudge in the right direction, somebody who takes the precious time out of their day to answer all of your questions and somehow remains patient through all of the fear, greed and fomo. Somebody who can talk you out of making those bad decisions. 

If you’re lucky enough to have somebody in your life who is knowledgeable and successful, and took the time to show you the ropes let me know in the comments! 

I’m very interested in hearing your story about how this person came into your life and how they helped you in your investing journey. 

Do you have any future plans to thank this person if you become successful as well?

** EDIT**

This post was suppose to be geared towards people in your “real life” friends, family, coworkers ect. Obviously you shouldn’t take advice from people online you have never met. You will likely get scammed, or lose your money. It wasn’t obvious and I apologize for the misunderstanding. 

It’s also extremely scary that people think that “nobody knows shit about fuck” There ARE some great knowledgeable investors in the world that you CAN learn from if they’re are willing to help you. 

If you did happen to meet a good friend online who become mentor! Feel free to share."
2/3/23,Payments for freelance jobs: Fiat (TradFi) vs Crypto,"A few days ago I delivered my first gig on Fiverr.

After that, I was charged 20% of the total paid in fees and it is taking 15 days for the payment to clear on the platform, so I can send it to another intermediary, who will charge more fees (3% + $3 + taxes) and ask for more time to send what was left to my bank account in reais (BRL).

But I also accept crypto for payments (BTC, ETH, XMR, BCH, XNO and stablecoins).

So... In the meantime, I've delivered another 4 jobs to p2p clients, who paid me in **nano** (3) and **usdt** (1).

XNO payments took less than 24h to be sent after delivery, and were settled in less than a second. No fees were charged. I received 100% of the amount sent.

USDT payments using the Tron network took 96h to be sent after delivery, and were settled in a few minutes. Very low fees were charged and the exchange for $BRL was low cost.

If this is the case, then why are people so obsessed with determining if the bottom is in or is yet to come? 

The conventional wisdom of the sub dictates DCA is the way to reduce volatility in a historically volatile market. Does it really matter if we go back down to 15-16k if people are planning on buying regularly over the coming years? I’ve personally been buying BTC and ETH for years and while I’ve gotten lucky a few times, I’m usually an idiot with timing tops and bottoms and I’d much rather be boring over time and reduce my risk exposure. 

I know moons won’t farm themselves and TA is hotly debated around here, just wondering if it really makes a difference or it’s just psychological."

2/3/23,What do you think about the latest Fed meeting minutes?,"The Federal Reserve released its meeting minutes for January last week, and it's clear that the Fed's fight against inflation is far from over. Fed officials are worried that inflation could become entrenched if it continues to stay high, which would lead to behavioral changes that could cause even more inflation.

The Fed is also concerned about potential runs on non-bank financial institutions, concerns about liquidity in the treasury market, and relief that crypto wasn't more connected to the financial system during its crash. The minutes reveal that a few Fed officials were pushing for a 0.5 rate hike, but the Fed decided to raise interest rates by just 0.25 based on the data they had discussed during the meeting.

The Fed will continue to sell government debt from the Fed's massive balance sheet every month, which will raise interest rates further. The big question is what the Fed's most recent minutes mean for the markets in the coming weeks. The Fed's fight against inflation could cause markets to crash, but the Fed wants it all to happen in an orderly manner to reduce the risk that something in the financial system will break on the way down."

2/3/23,"Explainer: Silvergate (crypto's bank) might fall, which could be bad for crypto","Why you should care: a lot of big money in crypto moved around via SEN, the Silvergate Exchange Network. The SEN meant that all exchanges and institutional clients banking with Silvergate could move money almost instantly between themselves and other clients.

For context: at the end of last year they had 1700 accounts there, FTX and related firms alone had 20 accounts. Since 2017, they have facilitated over $1 trillion in internal transactions. Silvergate also gave out loans to Saylor.

Exchanges that are or were part of the network: Kraken, BinanceUS, FTX, Gemini, Coinbase, Paxos, Genesis, Bitstamp, Circle, pretty much all big parties you can think of.

Silvergate's stock is down about 96% from its ATH (back at the end of 2021). It's now delaying its annual report and said it's re-evaluating its ability to operate as a going concern, and states it's ""less than well capitalized"".

Why this would hurt: exchanges and bigger parties all benefit from being able to move fiat quickly. It allows them to arbitrage, but also just generally allows them to banked, to take in deposits and such.

Now best-case scenario is they recapitalise. Worst case is they go under, and exchanges and such still have fiat deposited with them. Many exchanges and such are already looking for banking elsewhere, but this is becoming more difficult again with the US being much less friendly to crypto.

Does this mean crypto dies? No, obviously. But it would be a hit in liquidity in markets, and would be a hit to how easily exchanges can access and move around money. It's a story worth following."

It's so bad, that you are way more likely to make money off actual rug pull scam coins than winning even a secondary lower cash payout jackpot. 

The people who run the lottery are the real winners.
Sorta like how shitcoin devs will burn tokens everytime they are purchased but instead keeps it in a hidden acc.

In lottery 50% is the actual price pool.  So a 10,000,000 jackpot is now 5M. 

Now you have to pay another 40% in taxes combined with state, and local. So now your total earnings is 2.5M instead of 10M.

So, devs for the lottery take in 75% of everything guaranteed. 

Not only this. When you lose, you lose all your money invested.    When a crypto tanks, you may lose 99.9% but there will be some change left.  So crypto isn't even good at taking everything. It will leave you left with something, even if it's only 0.005ea.

2/3/23,Physical wallets: What are the risks and the benefits?,"This has been on my mind for a bit, and I wanted to get an open opinion/advice. 

I was thinking of buying a ledger wallet to hold my crypto, I love them so much. I think it’s so cool that this little device that looks like a pregnancy test can hold my assets. 

Now I have a few concerns I would like to share:

#QUESTION 1: What if it gets stolen

Say a robber comes to my house, and takes it. Are my assets lost? Can I somehow retrieve it? Even worse, if my mom thought it was some trash and threw it out. 

Are my funds lost? Is there a way to retrieve it? That’s my first question, what’s the recovery like?

#QUESTION 2: Staking and defi

I hold atom, I love my atom. I stake my atom, but can I stake my coins with using a ledger? If so is it like a normal staking or is it a pain to stake? 

And can I lend out my crypto to fellow crypto bros? 

#QUESTION 3: A second way to access funds

If an earthquake happens and a piano comes out of the sky and crushes it, are my funds gone? 

This is a worry, I live in Queensland with, really, really heavy rain sometimes. And my worry is it won’t survive if where I put it, water comes from the ceiling falls into it and it breaks due to being wet. 

#QUESTION 4: I don’t own the house, I’m renting. What if I forget it?

Say for some reason when the lease is up I forget to bring it. Similar to my other question, is there a way to like buy another ledger and log in? Is that a thing? Kind of like iCloud. If you have the password you have access, is that a thing? 

#QUESTION 5: I don’t trust anyone 

Do I need to trust ledger? Say a meanie beanie took over the company, are they able to steal my assets? 

#QUESTION 6: Are wallet drainers a thing?

An airdrop says I get free crypto, nice can they digitally steal my assets?

#QUESTION 7: Any models more secure than others? 

The title of this question kind of asks it, any models make it more likely to get ‘hacked’


#CONCLUSION: Thank you in advance 

Looking forward to the answers and opinions on models to get, thanks a lot!"

I had some USDC in my METAMASK sitting on the Arbitrum network. 

I wanted to transfer some to my exchange. I’ve done this before many times, no big deal. 

Normally, I use orbiter.finance, swap it over to Ethereum Mainnet and send!  Few minutes later. You have the funds in your exchange. 

This time. I was tired and distracted. I skipped the bridging step and sent a lot of USDC straight from Arbitrum to my exchange. This wasn’t a small amount of USDC

After a while, I checked to see if it went through, as soon as I saw that no transfer was complete. I immediately knew what I did. I got complacent, saw ERC20 and hit send. 

Always remember:

BLOCKCHAIN TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT REVERSIBLE BY YOURSELF,METAMASK, OR YOUR EXCHANGE. 

Luckily, there is a chance to recover the lost funds if the exchange is willing to work with you. They can recover the funds by using “their” private keys and connecting “their” wallet to the proper network and retrieving your crypto. Most exchanges will be willing to try with no guarantee. 

I have contacted the exchange and I’m just playing the waiting game now. 

If you’re distracted, emotional or tired. DO NOT TRANSFER CRYPTO. 

I have been playing with crypto for years now and I still somehow managed to make this mistake. 

Don’t be me! 

There is always information available and people willing to help here if you have questions. You can also try a smaller test transaction first!"
2/3/23,Russian scientist use a supercomputer at a nuclear warhead facility to mine Bitcoin - Those days!,"In 2018, a Russian scientist reportedly attempted to use a supercomputer at a top-secret nuclear warhead facility to mine Bitcoin. The scientist was caught and detained by authorities after it was discovered that he had connected the supercomputer to the internet, which was a violation of security protocols. While it's not clear how much Bitcoin the scientist was able to mine before being caught, the incident highlights the potential for even the most high-security facilities to be vulnerable to crypto-related exploits.

According to reports, the incident took place at the Federal Nuclear Centre in Sarov, Russia. The scientist in question was reportedly working at the facility's supercomputer center and had attempted to use the facility's supercomputer to mine Bitcoin. The Federal Nuclear Centre is one of Russia's most secure facilities, and it's not clear how the scientist was able to connect the supercomputer to the internet without being detected.

After the incident was discovered, the Russian Federal Security Service reportedly took the scientist into custody and opened an investigation into the matter. While it's not clear what ultimately happened to the scientist, the incident highlights the potential security risks associated with cryptocurrency mining and the need for strong security protocols, even in the most secure facilities."

With the inflation and the volatility of some cryptocurriencies, sounds reasonable that our community have some kind of backup plan ready to replace ones we have today.

**Creating a new currency requires certain features such as ease of use, wide acceptance, stability in pricing, and low cost.**

I belive that what's most important in a new is that it must be easy to use, and almost everybody within a desired community should be willing to accept it. Also should also be stable in pricing and remain fairly cheap to use. 

That's the difficulty. Its hard getting people to care about a ""random"" digital currency and convince them accepting that as a payment, but creating a two-way exchange where one American dollar equals one new currency and vice versa can give the digits value. **what it means, is, in my opinion, stablecoins have a big role in mass adpotion.**

Maintaining the value of the currency will be the big challenge at this point. Normally governments do this by mandating that taxes get paid in their currency under threat of imprisonment, which as far as motivation goes is pretty good.

I would love to ear the community thoughts on this!

Thanks!"

2/3/23,What exactly is the Howey Test? I looked up the story behind it and made this simplified summary of where the Howey Test came from.,"The famous Howey Test is based on a court case that reached the U.S Supreme Court in 1946 involving the SEC and W.J Howey company. This case set the precedent for determining what qualifies as an ""investment contract"", and would therefore need to be subject to the securities laws of the United States. An investment contract is just a type of security. A security is a financial asset that has monetary value and can be traded.


So, Howey Company owned large pieces of land with young citrus trees in Florida. It sold portions of land with the citrus trees. The buyers of the land would then lease back the land to Howey's subsidiary company (Howey-in-the-hills Service, Inc). Howey's company would take care of the citrus fruits until they matured, and sell the fruit on behalf of the owners. Howey and the buyers of land shared in the revenue from the sale of the citrus fruits. Most buyers had no knowledge of how to grow citrus fruits so they depended on the expertise of Howey's company. The SEC found out about this business arrangement and decided to sue Howey company and its subsidiary. 

The SEC took Howey to court because he didn't register the transactions as securities. SEC lost the case in the Federal District Court. The SEC appealed, and took the case to the Supreme Court. 
The Supreme Court ruled that the business arrangement by Howey was an investment contract (security). The supreme court came up with the four criteria for determining what constitutes as an investment contract under US laws.

• An investment of money

• In a common enterprise

• With the expectation of profit

• To be derived from the efforts of others


>""In the case of Howey, the buyers of the Florida citrus groves saw the transactions as valuable primarily because the labor and expertise were provided by others. Buyers only needed to invest capital to access an income stream. This classified the transaction as an investment contract under what is now known as the Howey Test, and therefore it needed to be registered with the SEC.""

The SEC argues that a lot of cryptocurrencies today would qualify as investment contracts under the Howey Test. Therefore, they need to be registered as securities and adhere to the securities laws of the United States."

We will be introducing restrictions on purchasing crypto currency from 28 February
 
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), who regulate the financial services industry, has highlighted certain risks associated with purchasing crypto currency.

 
With this in mind – and because we want to do everything we can to help keep members’ money safe – we’ll be making the following changes from 28 February:

We will be introducing limits on card payments made to crypto exchanges from a current account, and
We will not allow payments to crypto exchanges using a (name of bank) credit card.
 
The bank then details the daily limits which range from £100 to £5,000 depending on the account type.


Adult Current Accounts
You’ll have a £5,000 daily card limit

 
They go on to say they will continue to monitor the situation and may make more changes to limits or prevent payments to crypto exchanges in the future. 


What do people think? Will this kind of restriction get in your way or does it make sense given the risks and volatility involved with crypto.

TLDR: UK bank introducing restrictions to purchasing crypto. Will it affect you? Is it a wise move that protects or a curtailing freedom of choice? What do you think? Who else has experienced this?"

Now obviously the past 4 cycles have been the same after every halving: crypto experiences exponential growth in a year+ long bull rally then dips and resets until the cycle roughly 4 years later.

But here's the real question: will this time be different if the U.S. enters a recession soon? Historically speaking, once the fed pivots, approximately one year out the lag effect is felt and unemployment hits its peak, stocks hit their bottom's, etc. With crypto and stocks working closely together, will crypto do the same? Or will it decouple? If it's the same, then it's highly likely crypto will under perform for the first time ever and break the pattern of the 4 year cycles. What makes us believe that people are gonna rush to buy crypto if they're trying so hard to save on cash? 

You could say, ""oh well the fed will send out stimulus checks and that'll drive the markets up"". No, if they do that inflation will come roaring back.

What do you think?"
2/3/23,"The so-called daytraders are now holding below 1% of the total Bitcoin supply, a low only comparable to previous bear market bottoms.","If there is one holder class that is way different from each other holding class, it would be the daytraders or as you could often also describe them, the 24-hour holders. This is a very extreme cohort of short-term holders, where coins often already change their hands in under 24 hours. Meaning that a person bought and sold in under 24 hours and often those are daytraders that try to trade the markets.

Those are also seen as the most risky and speculative traders as you have to be highly skilled and especially experienced to not mis-time the markets, spoiler: many can not do that.

Now obviously all of this speculations is mostly associated with bull markets thus during a bull market those daytraders would make up a very low amount of the total supply:

Here we can see that it is not only a lower share of the total supply for them but nearly a record-low (!) as the supply held in the hands of those 24-hour traders has dropped below 1% which has only happened three previous time in the history of Bitcoin. Each time being a bear market bottom.

This once again shows that we are definitely at lows of sentiment and hype that is very comparable to previous bear market and sometimes even exceeds them."

2/3/23,"Crypto real world use cases, outside of converting to FIAT. Where do you use your crypto?","Cryptocurrency has come a long way since its inception over a decade ago. From being used primarily as a speculative investment, it has now evolved to become a legitimate form of payment for a variety of goods and services. While there are still some limitations to the widespread use of cryptocurrency as a means of exchange, there are several real-world use cases that have recently emerged:

Example:,Travala is a platform that allows individuals to book travel and hotel accommodations using various cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. Travala accepts over 40 cryptocurrencies, making it an attractive option for those who want to use their digital assets to fund their travels. The platform also offers discounts of up to 40% for those who pay with cryptocurrencies, so this becomes very enticing for some.  No idea how competitive they are relative to other travel aggregators.

Another real-world use case for cryptocurrency is online shopping. While there are still relatively few online retailers that accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment, there are some notable exceptions. For example, Overstock.com, one of the largest online retailers in the United States, began accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment in 2014. Other online retailers that accept crypto include Newegg and Shopify.

Lastly there are several websites that allow individuals to exchange crypto for gift cards from popular retailers such as Amazon and iTunes. I personally haven’t used any of these sites as I’m fearful of the legitimacy.  Has anyone ever used one successfully?

Curious on what you know or have used crypto for in the real world?"
2/3/23,Russian Bank Issues Bank Guarantee in Chinese Yuan Using Blockchain,
2/3/23,Why is IMF and World Bank anti bitcoin and crypto?Here's what I think,"

Cryptocurrency uses cryptography for security and operates independently of a middle man(central banks). Over the past decade, crypto and bitcoin in particular has become increasingly popular as an alternative to traditional banking.And even countries have started making it legal tender,which is a direct attack on the monopoly and control of traditional banks.Following points outline the reasons why IMF and other central banks consider bitcoin and crypto to be a threat.

Decentralization: Cryptocurrency transactions are decentralized, which means that they don't rely on a central authority such as a bank to validate transactions. This means that there are no middlemen involved, which reduces transaction costs and can make transactions faster and more efficient.

Anonymity: Cryptocurrency transactions are generally anonymous, which means that users can make transactions without revealing their identity. This can be seen as a threat to traditional banking, as banks rely on customer identification and anti-money laundering regulations to prevent fraud and illegal activities.

Accessibility: Cryptocurrency is accessible to anyone with an internet connection, whereas traditional banking requires users to have a bank account and other forms of identification. This means that cryptocurrency has the potential to reach people who are currently underserved by traditional banking services.

Globalization: Cryptocurrency is not tied to any particular country or currency, which means that it can be used for international transactions without the need for currency exchange. This can be seen as a threat to traditional banking, as banks often charge high fees for international transactions and exchange rates.

Security: Cryptocurrency transactions are secured using cryptography, which makes them difficult to hack or counterfeit. This means that cryptocurrency can be seen as more secure than traditional banking, which has been plagued by security breaches and fraud.

Lower transaction fees: Cryptocurrency transactions typically have lower fees than traditional banking transactions,(except eth gas,but it is being worked upon). This is because there are no intermediaries involved in cryptocurrency transactions, which reduces transaction costs.

Innovation: Cryptocurrency is a new and innovative technology that is constantly evolving. This means that there is a lot of potential for new applications and services that could challenge traditional banking services.

In conclusion, cryptocurrency is the biggest challenge to traditional banking and we will see this battle intensify in times to come.Lets hope crypto comes on top after all is said and done."

Ever asked yourself the same?

What did you learn?

Definitively I learnt to be patience. From my early days in 2017 when I bought and sold (in loss of course) I learnt to become an holder and wait. Be patient is the key.
So far stocks and crypto taught me basic of investing as well (in the hard way). Now I can read and evaluate chart. Estimate patterns. Invest with a minimum of brain instead of buying anything with a fancy name.
I have learnt to keep under control FOMO, keeping calm and not jumping in.
I learnt to DCA even when the market is bloody red.
Greed… well I still don’t know… I may find the answer after next bull.
A very important thing I got is to follow news… all markets are related and what happens out there is influencing crypto world.
Experience is the key and I’m enjoying all the process of getting it in the hard way, but with big hopes for the future.

One point in my favor? I never fall for a scam at least. What I lost stay all under my wrong decisions.

2/3/23,Australia Reserve Bank Actually Launches CBDC Pilot,"A CBDC is essentially a digital form of the paper currency of a central bank. The central bank has power over it, and it is a way that countries are trying to prevent the spread of BTC and other cryptos being used as a currency (there are other uses for it).

Australia's central bank just announces a [pilot program](https://beincrypto.com/reserve-bank-australia-launches-cbdc-pilot/). This is huge news since this is one of the few western countries actually to move past the talking phase of a CBDC. If you are in crypto just to make a buck, you probably don't care. If you care about privacy and government control, this can be alarming. 

Do you think the US will be next? We know that China hasn't had a ton of success with the digital yuan and was even paying people to use it initially (essentially a sign-up bonus)."

Bitcoin was the first crypto and has been dominant in this space, but there are lots of other cryptos which have huge market caps and volumes. Obviously each one of them acts independently and their ups & downs are different. However, we all agree that they follow the same trend, which is normally led by Bitcoin.

We are all waiting for the bull run because we know that practically all of them will rise to the moon, but which one will get more attention and will get higher is a mystery.

Therefore this raises the question, will cryptocurrencies decouple from bitcoin? Wouldn't it be better for the market as more people would be interested in different projects?

I'm not an expert in finances and markets so your opinions might be of more interest.

TL;DR: What the title says, can cryptos' prices act more independently? Is it healthy for the market that they act like this?"

2/3/23,What are your thoughts on Litecoin?,"At the time of writing this Litecoin sits at $94.81, and I personally would not call it a shitcoin. It's basically a stablecoin. *One of the earliest altcoins, in technical details, the Litecoin main chain shares a slightly modified Bitcoin codebase. The practical effects of those codebase differences are lower transaction fees, faster transaction confirmations, and faster mining difficulty retargeting. Due to its underlying similarities to Bitcoin, Litecoin has historically been referred to as the ""silver to Bitcoin's gold.""* 

Litecoin has a supply limit of 84 million, with a block time of 2.5 minutes.

The highest it's ever been traded was $350 on May 7th, 2021. 

I personally don't even hold Litecoin, but it's an interesting coin that's been around for over a decade, doesn't seem to get much love or even talked about, being that it's basically Bitcoins little brother. Litecoin seems to be a slow walker and enjoys the race when the bullrun comes around. I don't see this coin ever disappearing, maybe it's a good coin to invest in?

2/3/23,3 BTC price hurdles Bitcoin bulls are failing to clear in 2023,
2/3/23,"Using the Lightning Network is ~55106x cheaper than using Polygon, and Bitcoin's mainnet transactions are only 8% more expensive than Ethereum's and Polygon's ones combined","&#x200B;

As per the title. TL;DR at the end.

I've chosen them as they're prominent L2s from their respective main chains. Polygon data was fetched from polygonscan.com, LN data was fetched from https://1ml.com/statistics. The period of analysis is 1st Jan 2023 - 28th Feb 2023.

# Using the Lightning Network is ~55106x cheaper than using Polygon

A hell of a number!

The premise: I'm comparing the **average fee per transaction** on both L2s. I'm not interested in their nature nor am I interested to know if one is more useful than the other for this or that than. It's simply comparing average fees per transaction. Results in USD are:

**LN: $0.00000035**

**Polygon: $0.01928**

To get to the Polygon numbers, I've summed up the number of daily transactions and divided them by the newtork fees paid in MATIC. I then converted these to USD by fetching the MATIC price over the analysis period. LN network average fee is already available from the database mentioned in the first paragraph. This is the average base fee per node.

# Bitcoin's mainnet transactions are only 8% more expensive than Ethereum's and Polygon's weighed averages

[Yesterday I posted a short summary](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/11f78vi/ethereum_has_outperformed_bitcoin_by_460_in/) on the average number of transactions and fee per transaction of Bitcoin and Ethereum main layers. Some people pointed out that I should have included L2s because this or that, and here I answer: **I should have not**.

The premise: I was comparing **mainnet** fees and transactions. I wanted to know how much I would pay to **send ETH** **in the ETH main chain**. I wasn't interested in wETH, MATIC or whatever layer-2 solutions you people wanted to see. Likewise, I wanted to see how much I would pay to send BTC in the BTC main chain.

""It's like comparing apples to oranges"", people said. It's not, look at the premise above. They're both blockchains and they both can be used to transfer value in their respective mainnets. ""But ETH has smart contracts and etc etc"". Matters not to the premise above.

**But since you've asked...**

I've calculated the averages for each chain: Bitcoin's, Ethereum's and Polygon's. Their number of transactions are:

**Bitcoin: 17,146,792**

**Ethereum: 61,654,763**

**Polygon: 174,066,754**

[Numbers in the y axis are in millions](https://preview.redd.it/f69k6ztpacla1.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1e7bc3b8076464c1169b43e9ed15af2ae5b1044d)

Their average fees are:

**Bitcoin: $1.28**

**Ethereum: $4.47**

**Polygon: $0.01928**

https://preview.redd.it/e9blg7s4bcla1.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e414dc8d6067a7c53311746aa1588b7d5a5272b1

Finally, to compare Bitcoin's fees to Ethereum's and Polygon's ones **combined**, I've performed a simple weighed average for these last two as follows:

Average fee = (Avg fee ETH \* Number of transactions ETH  + Avg fee Polygon \* Number of transactions Polygon) / (Total transactions ETH+Polygon)

Results are:

**Bitcoin: $1.28**

**Ethereum+Polygon: $1.18**

Therefore the latter is roughly 8% cheaper than compared to Bitcoin. In some days, Bitcoin's fee were cheaper, as per the chart below.

https://preview.redd.it/e9ecbi8nccla1.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2cd1ab5f8c5ec2de73e2821bda9197c58719a969

# ""But you only compared one L2 from ETH, should have included all of them""

A great addition to the sub but feel free to do so, my time is limited.

# ""But you used a simple weighed average, should have performed more serious math""

A great addition to the sub but feel free to do so, my time is limited.

# TL;DR

* I've compared average transaction fees. I'm not interest in each layer's particularities such as smart contracts, number of nodes etc. I'm simply comparing average transaction fees.
* LN is way cheaper than Polygon
* As per requested in my other post, sending a transaction on Bitcoin's mainnet is, on average, only 8% more expensive than Ethereum+Polygon ones combined, but was cheaper in some days
* Does this comparison make sense from a practical point of view? No, it's nonsense because you can't transact on the ""Ethereum+Polygon"" chain, you have to chose one. I included these averages because, once more, people were complained on my previous post that I should have considered L2s in my rookie analysis for average transaction fees. Well, there you go."

2/3/23,[SERIOUS] It's Totally Normal to Sell Your Crypto Bag: HODLing Isn't Always Important take it from someone who lost his lifesavings,"truth is that HODLing isn't always the best strategy. Sometimes, it's better to sell your crypto bag and take your profits. Here are some reasons why:

Diversification: Diversification is key to any successful investment strategy. Holding on to a single cryptocurrency for too long can be risky, especially if the market takes a downturn. Selling some of your holdings and reinvesting in other cryptocurrencies can help you spread your risk and reduce your exposure to market volatility.

Realizing profits: The crypto market can be incredibly volatile, and prices can rise and fall rapidly. If you're lucky enough to have bought in at a low price and the value of your investment has skyrocketed, it might be time to take some profits off the table. Selling a portion of your holdings can help you realize gains while still leaving you with some exposure to potential future gains.

Personal circumstances: Sometimes, life happens, and you need to liquidate your investments. Maybe you need the money to cover unexpected expenses, or perhaps you've reached a financial goal and want to cash out some of your profits. Whatever the reason, it's perfectly normal to sell your crypto bag if it makes sense for your personal circumstances.



I don't want to mention project names I didn't sell tokens that was at their ATH and it dumped from 22 to almost cents below my entry.  [ https://imgur.com/a/HzBGisW ] 
don't marry a project, you don't owe anyone anything. 

So, HODLing isn't always the best strategy and there is no shaming on taking profits. Selling some of your holdings can help you diversify your portfolio, realize profits, and meet your personal financial goals. So, don't feel guilty for selling your crypto bag and fall victim for the narratives – it's a perfectly normal and reasonable thing to do.

2/3/23,Is Bitcoin's security at risk?,"Every day, roughly 144 blocks of BTC are mined - with the current block reward of 6.25 BTC.  Thanks to the halving system, rewards are cut in half every 4 years. 

Upcoming Halving Block Rewards:

* 2024: 3.25 BTC (468 BTC/day)
* 2028: 1.625 BTC (234 BTC/day)
* 2032: 0.8125 BTC (117 BTC/day)
* 2036: 0.40625 BTC (58.5 BTC/day)
* 2040: 0.203125 BTC (29.25 BTC/day)

# Why does this system fail?

Each of these daily rewards can be thought of as the total budget that BTC has to support its mining network.  Historically, price has grown significantly each halving cycle to offset this budget and mask the issue.  However, price cannot double forever.

When price stagnates, 50% of the miners that were previously profitable will now be losing money - pushing many to shut off their equipment for good.  Tech advances will push more out of the market - as having access to the ""best"" mining equipment out there will be essential to stay competitive.  As a result, we will lose a large chunk of miners every halving until the network is no longer secure.  **Each halving without price movement makes it 50% easier to perform a** [**51% attack**](https://www.crypto51.app/)**.**

# Can raising fees help?

I believe the short answer is no.  In theory, the loss in ""budget"" from block rewards during halvings could be offset by raising network fees.  However, the degree that fees would need to rise is too severe.

Off-chain activity would starve BTC of the money that it needs from fees.  Cex's already offer nearly free trades within their internal systems- why spend $100 to send BTC when the middleman will do it for pennies?  This could set off a death spiral, where people are fleeing on-chain activity due to raising fees, and fees have to raise further due to less people using the chain.

# Next steps

There are no blue-chips in crypto (yet) - be safe and remember that ANY project in this world can fail.  Without major changes, BTC may be among the hardest to fall.

What do you think can be done to prevent this in the future?"

""Shark Fin is our principal-protected product that allows you to explore BTC and ETH volatility – whether the market is bearish or bullish.""

They go on to describe a product where your principal is not at risk, and two scenarios (one bullish and one bearish) where the minimum APY is 1% and rises as high as 11%. From their website again:

""Imagine an hypothetical situation where:

Subscription Amount: 1,000 USDT
APY: 1% - 18%
Term: 7 Days
BTC price range: $18,000 - $21,000

Scenario 1: Below the range

Expiration price = $17,000 < $18,000 APY = 1% Earnings = 1,000 x 1% x 7/365 = 0.192 USDT

Scenario 2: Within the range

Expiration price = $19,500, within $18,000-$21,000 APY = 4% + (19,500 - 18,000)/(21,000-18,000) x (18% - 4%) = 11% Earnings = 1,000 x 11% x 7/365 = 2.110 USDT

Scenario 3: Above the range

Expiration price = $24,000 > $21,000 APY = 1% Earnings = 1,000 x 1% x 7/365 = 0.192 USDT""

There's a similar example for a bearish scenario.

My question to the megaminds of r/cc is this: it sounds too good to be true, so what's the catch? Is it just that the APY is likely to be really low outside of the specific boundaries, or is it something else (beyond the risk of using a CEX)?

The future looks bright for BAT and the Brave browser. With a growing user base, innovative technology, and a strong development team, BAT has the potential to become a major player in the world of crypto.From the top of my mind i can list these reasons.



Growing Popularity: The Brave browser has been gaining popularity over the past few years, and its native cryptocurrency, BAT, has followed suit. The increasing user base and adoption of the Brave browser has led to a rise in demand for BAT tokens, driving its price up.

Unique Business Model: Brave's business model is unique in the world of internet browsers. It allows users to earn BAT tokens by opting in to view ads. This creates a win-win situation for both users and advertisers, as users can earn tokens while advertisers get access to a more engaged audience.

Strong Development Team: The development team behind Brave and BAT is experienced and talented. The team includes Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript and co-founder of Mozilla Firefox, and Brian Bondy, a former software engineer at Mozilla.

Innovative Technology: Brave is not just another browser, it is a technology platform that is leveraging blockchain technology to create a better internet. The browser is built on top of Chromium, the open-source project behind Google Chrome, but with added privacy features such as ad-blocking and tracking protection.Recently they have integrated an AI summary generater in browser search as well.

Potential for Mass Adoption: With the rise of online privacy concerns, Brave has positioned itself as a privacy-focused alternative to traditional browsers. As more people become aware of the privacy risks associated with traditional browsers, there is a high potential for mass adoption of Brave and BAT.

Strong Community: Brave and BAT have a strong and active community of users and developers. The community is dedicated to improving the platform and making it accessible to more people around the world. This level of community engagement is a positive sign for the long-term growth of the platform.

As more people become aware of the benefits of the Brave browser and BAT, we can expect to see a continued rise in demand for these tokens."

I’d not seen the FCA change though):

“
We will be introducing restrictions on purchasing crypto currency from 28 February
 
Dear xxxxxxxxx,
 
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), who regulate the financial services industry, has highlighted certain risks associated with purchasing crypto currency.
 
With this in mind – and because we want to do everything we can to help keep members’ money safe – we’ll be making the following changes from 28 February:
We will be introducing limits on card payments made to crypto exchanges from a current account, and
We will not allow payments to crypto exchanges using a Nationwide credit card.
 
From the 28 February, where we identify payments to crypto exchanges, the below restrictions will apply:

Account type
NEW daily limit
Adult Current Accounts
(FlexBasic, FlexStudent, FlexGraduate, FlexAccount, FlexPlus or FlexDirect)
You’ll have a £5,000 daily card limit
FlexOne
You’ll have a £100 daily card limit
Nationwide credit card
Neither you nor any additional card holder will be able use a Nationwide credit card to purchase crypto currency
 
The limits are applied daily per card. This means if you have more than one current account, the limit will apply to each account. Joint account holders will each have limits applied to each card.
 
We will continue to monitor the situation and may make more changes to limits or prevent payments to crypto exchanges in the future.

The platform looks great, but the concept of having to ""deposit funds"", just sounds like a backward step to me.  

At a glance it appears to me that dydx is a CEX that has made its order book algorithms open source, and uses blockchain technology and smart contracts to run their money management and exchange system.  They call themselves a DEX, but can they be a DEX if I do not hold my own assets?  Or have I misunderstood the way the system works?

Any insight would be useful, because aside from KYC i'm struggling to see the appeal of using dydx vs one of the big CEX's like binance."

I tried searching for opinions and basically the people who would use it and knew about this stuff said that it doesn't make much sense to use Akash Network over AWS or others since they offer lot more utility and AWS it's only a bit more expensive, something like x3, but still lot of people at messari hold it and if you don't know messari it's a great website to look for crypto project information.

2/3/23,20 central banks are looking at Ripple.,"Brooks Entwistle, a top executive at Ripple, stated in a recent interview that Ripple is working with over 20 central banks. Discussions are mainly focused on the development of CBDCs.

Interest in the XRP cryptocurrency remains high, which is not surprising given the scale of the institutions Ripple is partnering with.

Ripple focuses on CBDCs in 2023 A member of the XRP management team spoke in an interview about Ripple's plans for a Central Bank Digital Currency. Entwistle explained that interaction with regulatory bodies around the world is definitely necessary. Unlike the United States, regulatory bodies in Singapore, Tokyo, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom are actively engaging in dialogue and discussing the challenges posed by CBDCs.

[https://youtu.be/mm7Pzi9hSlU](https://youtu.be/mm7Pzi9hSlU)

 According to Entwistle, CBDCs are a key goal for Ripple in 2023. This presents Ripple as the leading provider of solutions for central banks.

>""There are over 200 countries in the world. Therefore, there are many central banks that have   
 different needs for implementing financial policy.""

China is one of the most advanced countries building the foundations for CBDCs. However, in Asia, Europe, or Africa, there are many economies with fewer resources and struggling with many problems. Ripple may prove to be an important counterparty for such countries.

Ripple representatives are currently collaborating in various countries, and examples include Bhutan and Palau, where pilot projects are taking place. Despite their small size, they seem ideal for testing solutions offered by Ripple.

XRP in contact with over 20 countries Manager Brooks Entwistle confirmed in a newly published interview that XRP token creators are in dialogue with over 20 central banks.

>""So, we are in dialogue not with ten, not twenty, but many other central banks around the world. Most of the discussions are focused on digital currency.""

Basically, due to insufficient technological and financial resources, countries such as Bhutan or Palau cannot afford to model CBDCs. Ripple, on the other hand, has both the knowledge and experience. It is no wonder that it seeks cooperation beyond the United States.

In addition, the Ripple manager openly states that the project focuses on cooperation with economies that approach the cryptocurrency industry transparently and in a friendly manner.

CBDCs and cross-border payments The main difference between CBDCs and cryptocurrencies is the fact that CBDCs are issued and managed by a central authority. Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, are theoretically decentralized and do not have central authority. However, this does not mean that the know-how of XRP creators is not at the center of central bank interest.

CBDCs can be used as an alternative to cash to improve the efficiency of payment systems. Additionally, they can promote financial revolution by providing digital financial services.

CBDCs can also simplify cross-border payments. According to Entwistle, Ripple has generated a lot of interest in this area. In his opinion, cross-border transactions are one of the biggest financial problems in the world that no one has found a solution to.

However, Ripple is convinced that this challenge is not a problem for them. A global network is needed to solve this problem. XRP offers it through RippleNet.  

According to the manager's interview, the technology is already available in over 70 countries.

>""It's not possible to create a network of 70 countries overnight with just a hundred volunteers. Of course, there are many wonderful innovations in individual sectors or in certain regions. However, we offer a global solution. Therefore, we must continue to work hard and develop the network for additional interested economies."""

2/3/23,"The 2020 bull run was a once in a lifetime event, another one is not ""inevitable"" as so many people want to claim.","The factors that lead up to the 2020 bull run were once in a lifetime, if not even greater. It mainly had its core in the Covid pandemic which brought together a series of events leading to an unprecedented bull run in both stocks and crypto. It all boiled down to people having a lot of extra money and not much to spend it on. Being stuck at home with extra money lead to a flood of capital into highly speculative markets. That is to say people were filling their time by gambling, they were looking for winning lottery tickets.

I constantly see posts here, on Twitter, in Discords etc talking about the next ""inevitable"" bull run. ""what are you buying to prepare for the next bull run,"" ""when do you think the crypto winter will end and the next bull run begin"" and on and on and on...

The chances of another 2020-style bull run happening are almost zero. What is much more likely is a slow recovery that mirrors the recovery of the economy overall. No one knows how long that will take or if things will get worse before getting better but what we can say with pretty good confidence is we will not see events similar to 2020 again in our lifetimes. Even when the economy recovers people won't go pouring all their money back into crypto because unlike in 2020 they will have lots of other options for spending that money.

So if you are just here for the winning lottery ticket that is supposedly ""inevitable"" maybe you should rethink your interest in crypto. Sure there will be some outliers that blow up seemingly over night but a much more inevitable path forward is a more realistic market. The industry as a whole is better off with people that actually believe in the long term potential anyway and not just speculators who lead to extreme volatility in a way the leaves a few insiders rich and everyone else poor. Not to mention talking about an inevitable bull run just sounds like shilling. Sorry to burst your bubbles!

&#x200B;

tl;dr The chances of another 2020 style bull run are almost zero and yet tons of people talk about it as if it is ""inevitable."" If you are one of those people you might want to rethink your investment plan/strategy.

&#x200B;

edit: I think people are reading this as me saying the market is done. That is not the case at all and we will eventually get to all time highs again. I just think it will be a much more steady and rational climb up and only for the best projects.

But other sites still have their fluff pieces up and available, unedited from the days past. With so much about SBF on the internet, if you just search his name it will provide you with a huge list of articles and news about the fraud and everything that has happened since his fall from grace.

[Presented by crypto.com](https://preview.redd.it/3vvggz6qedla1.png?width=1380&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a4e2589a09f6245ac8ef8f02780649e0cb928626)

Some of the great points in this biography are these wild excerpts:

>During his college years, Bankman-Fried developed an affinity for a life philosophy that still guides him to this day — effective altruism. That is, the philosophical belief that one should aim to bring about the greatest amount of good to the largest amount of people.

&#x200B;

> In his spare time, if any — as per his infamous workaholic routine — Bankman-Fried is an avid philanthropist who plans to eventually give away most of his 11-figure fortune. 

Then it goes on to speak a bit about his ""lofty achievements"" of buying the rights to Miami's NBA stadium and all those other lofty achievements we know and loathe.

Also worth noting the infamous words of CDC:

https://preview.redd.it/jreon57jgdla1.png?width=295&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=be1bff7085b571d3a1c3f926694d0a6be9bb39bc

To end it all, we're given a true gem of the extreme hypocrisy that went on:

>The CEO also believes that stablecoins should be better reported and audited, claiming that more transparency would solve “80% of the problems while allowing stablecoins to thrive onshore.” Today, Bankman-Fried urges regulators to create a unified crypto network and consider that focusing on disclosure and fraud prevention may be more important than whether crypto assets should be classified as securities.

2/3/23,Rep. Hill says he plans to work with House Agriculture on crypto legislation,
2/3/23,The FHLB is a mess and should have no business with Silvergate or crypto banks.,"Its one thing when an exchange or a shitcoin ponzi goes bust, but its another when an FDIC-insured, Federal Reserve System bank with $13B in AUM hits the dirt. Is this the “Lehman Brothers” moment we’ve been waiting for? They have now lost the business of Circle, Paxos, Coinbase, FTX (lol), and Gemini is reevaluating as of this afternoon.

They initially had reported in an 8-K that annual losses incurred were a hair shy of $1B, but in January/February have been asked by a lender, Federal Home Loan & Bank, to repay their loans in full ($4.3B). FHLBs are privately owned banks with high credit ratings so they can offer advances with low interest as long as the counterparty meets capital requirements. They can be short-term or even into several decades since theyre primarily for mortgages and member banks.

This is particularly interesting and terrifying considering that in Silvergate’s 8-K they claim to be “well-capitalized” which is a term used by banks to fall into a specific risk-defining category factoring in capital ratios/risk ratios/leverage/equity. Suffice to say they “meet capital requirements” especially considering they were able to pay the $4.3B, which begs the question *why ask for it to be repaid?*. The FHLB gets whats called **statutory lien priority**, so if a borrower goes under it gets to jump ahead of any unsecured creditors *even the FDIC*. They rarely take any losses on advances for this reason, they really dont care UNLESS collateral becomes no good or the bank’s regulator says time is up (this would be the Fed since theyre in the Reserve System and would explain why they didnt go to them for funds). This basically acts as a bailout considering they’re very liquid and stand to make almost all their money back in case of a bankruptcy.

There’s so much more to this than this post. Government and regulators should without a doubt be looking deep into traditional institutions bailing out Reserve banks in emergency situations. Imagine if the FHLB allowed the loan to roll over and Silvergate went under tomorrow, that wouldve left the FDIC almost a **$5B bag holder**. It no doubt goes against their guidelines considering the existence of the banks are to support housing, how was this relationship allowed to form?"
2/3/23,"TIL Satoshi Nakamoto, creator of Bitcoin, is not a real person, but a pseudonymous for a person or group. Here´s some of what we know.","I´ve been living under a rock, yes. I started in crypto about a year ago but in the bear market I just left the crypto there and recently came back to learn and invest some more. Just recently found this out so I read some info about Satoshi. Here´s some info:

* They started working on the code in 2007.
* In 2010 gave control of the project to various figures in the community and stopped his involvement with it.
* In 2012 claimed to be a 37 year old man living in japan, tough some people contest the truth of this statement (language, time stamps for their posts, etc.).
* Colleagues of Satoshi stated that they think they could be a group of persons, or a genius at coding.
* Possible identities are: Hal Finney, Dorian Nakamoto, ~~Craig Wright~~ or Nick Szabo, among others.
* They have a bust in Budapest ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi\_Nakamoto#/media/File:Bust\_of\_Satoshi\_Nakamoto\_in\_Budapest.jpg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto#/media/File:Bust_of_Satoshi_Nakamoto_in_Budapest.jpg))
* A satoshi is the smallest denomination of a bitcoin (100 millionth of a bitcoin).
* Owns between 750,000 and 1,100,000 bitcoin. In ATH would be US$73 billion.

I was surprised with the story of the creator of all this and I hope his vision becomes true and makes us all rich in the process.

2/3/23,Why the just released EIP-4337 (Account Abstraction) is a big thing for Ethereum and EVM chains!,"EIP-4337 is an Ethereum proposal that enables accounts to be abstracted from the blockchain. It turns users' wallets into smart contract accounts, in order to make Ethereum wallets more user-friendly.

The proposal enables:
 - Any authentication logic (not just public-private keys)
 - Gasless transactions
 - Bundled transactions
 - Recoverable wallets (via social recovery)

Yesterday, the Ethereum Foundation announced EIP-4337 passed its security audit and has been deployed on mainnet.

https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-erc-4337-smart-accounts-launch-at-walletcon-account-abstraction-is-here

This is a tremendous step change in how users interact with blockchains. Users won't need to understand how blockchains work just to use them safely (e.g. no more account losses due to losing a private key).

Part of its genius is that it doesn't require the blockchain itself to do anything. Instead it uses higher level infrastructure, so it works on any EVM chain today.

Anyone can deploy ERC-4337 on any EVM-compatible chain. It's permissionless.

The Ethereum Foundation also announced $300,000 in grants for account abstraction projects."

It could, for example, rewrite its settings (intentionally, or unintentionally) which would allow it to access features which it initially couldn't access. Or it could think that its acting in your best interest, and perform an action you never asked for (e.g. make purchases).

One of the ways this could be resolved, is by storing the AI settings on the blockchain. Each time you want to give the AI certain permissions, or take them away, it requires a confirmation with your private key. The settings would quite literally be stored on chain, and since it's virtually impossible for one AI to corrupt an entire chain, it wouldn't be able to change its own settings (thus limiting its access on your device).

This could be applied to any application. If we want to ensure that only a human can make changes, secure your settings on-chain.

However, by design, it has limitations that prevent it from reaching its full potential. Despite ongoing projects on Bitcoin working towards improving the network to create specialized systems, they aim to offer increased security, scalability, and functionality. In this article, we will take a closer look at the top 5 Bitcoin projects to elevate the possibilities of this blockchain network to the next level.

# Bitcoin Projects: Why Build?

Projects aim to unlock the potential of Bitcoin. While it is the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, it has limitations in terms of scalability and usability. For example, the current transaction processing capacity of the Bitcoin network is limited. Transaction confirmation can take longer compared to other blockchain networks. Additionally, the Bitcoin blockchain is transparent, meaning that all transaction details are publicly visible, which can raise privacy concerns for users.

Furthermore, Bitcoin's scripting language is limited, making it difficult to create smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Therefore, projects are built on Bitcoin to increase its capabilities and solve these limitations, such as improving scalability, privacy, and functionality.

In summary, the goal is to improve Bitcoin's capabilities. New projects aim to add versatility and efficiency to the blockchain network to meet the growing requirements of users and investors.

# Stacks: Building a Decentralized Internet

Formerly known as [Blockstack](https://pl.beincrypto.com/cena/blockstack/), Stacks is a platform that aims to create a more secure and decentralized internet. By using Bitcoin as its technological foundation, Stacks aims to leverage its security and immutability features while also providing increased functionality and scalability. The platform enables developers to build decentralized applications and smart contracts while ensuring that user data remains under their control.

Co-founder Muneeb Ali believes that Bitcoin is the most secure blockchain and positions Stacks as a platform for building a decentralized internet.

# Rootstock: Smart Contract Platform

[Rootstock](https://rootstock.io/) (RSK) collaborates with the Bitcoin network to increase adoption. RSK is a smart contract platform that enables developers to build decentralized applications that are compatible with Bitcoin.

By leveraging Bitcoin as its foundation, RSK offers increased interoperability, making it an attractive option for developers looking to build projects on Bitcoin. Additionally, RSK focuses on promoting financial inclusion and providing access to financial services for populations with underdeveloped infrastructure.

# Komodo: Customization and Interoperability

Komodo enables developers to create custom blockchains that provide strong security and privacy features. Utilizing Bitcoin as its foundation, Komodo offers interoperability with other blockchains, making it a versatile option for developers looking to build decentralized applications.

In addition, Komodo allows developers to create their own consensus mechanisms and transaction models, making it a highly configurable platform for the development of various blockchains.

One area of controversy is the much-hated and outdated voting system, particularly present in the United States. Indeed, voting in the USA has not changed much since the Civil War. People often stand in line for hours, then have to fill out complicated paper ballots. Moreover, determining the winner often takes days or weeks. Komodo seeks to change this.

# Mintlayer: Bringing DeFi and Smart Contracts to Bitcoin

[Mintlayer](https://www.mintlayer.org/en/) (MLT) is a layer-two protocol that enables developers to build DeFi, dApps, and smart contracts on Bitcoin. By providing infrastructure and tools, Mintlayer lays the foundation for pushing the boundaries of Bitcoin and realizing its full potential.

Mintlayer is the first DeFi platform with direct interoperability with the native Bitcoin network. Its DEX for atomic swaps provides counterparties with security against risk and confidence for users.

Scalability on the Bitcoin network is improved with Mintlayer's UTXO model and signature aggregation.

The UTXO model makes it easier to group P2P transactions, allowing users to group multiple transactions into one. Signature aggregation compresses payment sizes by up to 70%, preventing network congestion that is a common problem for Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains.

# Liquid Network: Scaling and Enhancing Bitcoin

Liquid Network is a sidechain protocol that ranks in our top 5 Bitcoin projects. It mainly serves cryptocurrency traders, institutional investors, and exchanges. Developed by Blockstream, the network facilitates fast, private, and secure issuance, exchange, and transfer of assets on the BTC network.

Liquid uses signed blocks that accelerate transaction processing and approval. This makes it ideal for arbitrage traders who execute fast cross-exchange trades to make profits. Blocks are confirmed within two minutes, compared to the ten minutes required on the Bitcoin blockchain.

Confidential transactions on the Liquid Network hide key transaction data from third parties, making them visible only to direct participants. This feature increases transaction privacy and reduces concerns about third-party monitoring for large-scale transactions.

The higher throughput of the Liquid network limits network congestion. This provides lower transaction costs, making it more accessible to retail and institutional investors. With Liquid Network, they can trade BTC at low transaction costs while leveraging the security and liquidity of Bitcoin.

In addition to its core features, Liquid introduces tokenization, interoperability, and programmable functionality to the Bitcoin blockchain. These features increase the network's capabilities, allowing it to compete with newer layer-one technologies like Eth3reum, S0lana, and C@rdano.

# Bitcoin Projects: Final Thoughts

Bitcoin projects and their development are a significant factor for the blockchain industry and, more importantly, for consumers. By leveraging Bitcoin's security, these platforms can create systems that offer increased functionality. Innovative blockchains take the most valuable cryptocurrency to a higher level, offering more specialized features. This will likely increase its adoption and the value of the entire network."
2/3/23,Just found out! How cryptocurrencies are taxed？,"**How To Report Cryptocurrencies On Your Taxes In 5 Seconds**

https://preview.redd.it/yzg0hmhiicla1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f0d562e8d6336181cd420b527392851c2a05ee5b

In recent years, more and more Americans have been getting into the cryptocurrency game with BTC, ETH, or other coins, but the laws around how to handle taxes for crypto transactions are still a bit of a wild west. So, let me break down how cryptocurrencies are taxed in the good ol’ USA.   
 

# Are cryptocurrencies subject to taxation?

Just like any other property, cryptocurrencies are taxable in the US. If you make a profit by selling or trading your crypto, that gain is subject to capital gains tax. And if you sell or trade your crypto at a loss, you can deduct that loss from other capital gains to reduce your overall tax burden.

The amount of tax you owe depends on how much capital gain/loss you made on your investment and how long you held onto the asset. Since each taxable event can create a capital gain, it’s important to keep track of the date, cost basis, sale value, and fees associated with each transaction.

# Which crypto events are taxable and which ones aren’t?

**Taxable events include:**

* Selling crypto for good old American dollars (USD)
* Trading crypto for other cryptocurrencies (e.g., swapping BTC for ETH)
* Using crypto to buy goods or services
* Receiving crypto as a result of mining or a fork

**On the flip side, the following events are typically not taxable:**

* Buying crypto with good old American dollars (except in cases where the purchase price is lower than the fair market value of the purchased coins)
* Donating crypto to tax-exempt organizations
* Gifting crypto to someone (although if the gift is big enough, it may trigger a gift tax)
* Transferring crypto from one wallet you own to another wallet you own

# How do I file my taxes on crypto?

Currently, most exchanges only offer transaction records, which means you’ll need to use another software or program to complete your taxes accurately.

""Recent high-profile failures in the crypto sector are an important reminder that we have a long way to go before crypto becomes a part of mainstream payments and financial services,"" a spokesperson for Visa said.

""Our efforts continue to focus on the underlying blockchain technology and how that can be applied to help address current pain points and build more efficient systems,"" a spokesperson for Mastercard said.

2/3/23,Crypto storage and security.,Thoughts on the Arculus card or similar products for crypto storage and security? I am confused by all of the back and forth in the reviews for the products and don’t know exactly how secure it may be. Any help or advice would be helpful!
2/3/23,Isn’t there a way you can check for funds received on the blockchain?,"I used cashapp to buy some BTC, bought it several times and transferred my funds to electrum no issue. 

Well I was buying something and the seller hasn’t received the funds yet even though they have left cashapp already. I know they’re not scamming me because I have bought from them before with no issue. 

What I did differently though is sent straight from cashapp to their wallet because I didn’t have my laptop on me to send to my wallet first, and I received a text yesterday saying it was confirmed on the chain but yeah seller claims they haven’t received funds yet, and thinks perhaps it is still mining. They said they think it’s the network cashapp uses that’s slowing it down. 

Is there anyway I can confirm? I know the address was correct. I heard there was a way to trace transactions if you had the wallet address, which I do, though. Is that true?"
2/3/23,Reminder PSA for bitcoin transacted through exchanges,"If you buy bitcoin from a centralized exchange like Coinbase or Kraken and do not move it to your own off-exchange wallet, you don't actually own bitcoin—you own a record for bitcoin.  Congratulations, not bitcoin, but bitcoin on paper

And if you're interested in paper bitcoin you might also be interested in a bridge in Brooklyn I could sell you cheap, too"

2/3/23,Can We Have A Future Where Every Mobile Phone Is A Bitcoin Node?,"Storage Costs per GB 1981 - 2010:

*1981 — $300,000*

*1987 — $50,000*

*1990 — $10,000*

*1994 — $1000*

*1997 — $100*

*2000 — $10*

*2004 — $1*

*2010 — $0.10*

It's obvious that two things are happening with storage overtime, it's getting smaller and it's getting cheaper.

Can we imagine a future where TBs are seen like GBs are currently seen? And your mobile phone has 500tb of storage built in? 

If the Bitcoin Blockchain if 1TB in size in 2030, every single phone could have the capacity to be it's own full node."
2/3/23,What are the absolute easiest ways to acquire BTC,"What are the absolute easiest and fastest ways to get bitcoin if you're a total noob and non tech savvy. I'm thinking 

1. Bitcoin ATM? It sound like they use KYC though even if you pay with cash. Does this take time to set up or do you have instant access to your coins? It sounds like they charge upwards of 20% once you pay the ATMs fees and the crypto partners fees 
2. Coinbase/gemini but this requires verification procedures that can take a while?
3. Buying bitcoin through cash app
4. I see this service 'strike' recommended in search but I've never heard of it before. Is it legit? How long does it take from signup to being able to withdraw coin
5. Moonpay? It sounds like they charge like 20% though
6. paxful. There are some sellers on paxful that only charge like 5%, but to my knowledge paxful has 1. KYC which probably takes time and 2. has a $15 withdraw fee for withdrawing bitcoin from the market 

Is there any better option? Bitcoin is supposed to be decentralized but every single one of the above options requires KYC which probably takes several days to verify. I remember this service that used to exist that allowed you to deposit cash and get bitcoin almost instantly for a relatively small percentage but I can't remember what it was called

But I’m just a little confused on how to get good at it. I feel like it’s like gambling in a way. I’ve also noticed it’s not more so how much it changes over night or weekly…. It’s more so how much you invest and long term price fluctuations. I need guidance. Also why won’t blockchain let me use my chime bank account to buy BTC? I’ve been having to buy BTC via Cashapp then send It to Coinbase or blockchain etc…. I heard binance is good too so I’m in the process of opening an account there. I owe the big banks money so chime is all I can really use right now. I want to make money with crypto, and I have money to invest. But I take peoples advice with a grain of salt especially with crypto."
2/3/23,if block size increases can there ebe more transactions?,"I think we can all agree that a big problem with btc is scaling with the there only is a maximum of 7tps. This is not enough for the future. 

Now, if we increase the block size and with that the transaction increase, let's say from 1MB to 100MB, i am assuming it will mean btc will have a tps of 70p, **but what disadvantages would it have?*


**Edit:** not saying to implement this just asking for the cons of this, I am not for making block sizes bigger btw"

2- The largest staking pool (Lido) holds almost 30% of all staked ETH at an average loss of nearly $1,000. The staked ETH has an average loss of 24%.

Typically, selling pressure arises when participants have extreme profits, which is not currently true for staked ETH.  Additionally, the most profitable staked ETH was staked less than a year ago and has not seen significant profit-taking events in the past.

However, my crypto transactions are all in different places, some on Centralized Exchanges and some in DeFi. So, just exporting from Crypto\_com app and other exchanges is not sufficient.

I created a Koinly account in the hopes of being able to use the free account to just export a report that my tax preparer can use to fill out the proper IRS forms. However, I'm not seeing an option to download anything outside of their Tax Reports page. On Tax Reports, I can see my big loss for the year, but it says that I have to get a paid plan to download any report. I already pay someone to prepare my taxes; I don't want to pay $179 for information that I will then hand over to my tax preparer, whom I will also have to pay to prepare the taxes.

Have I missed something in Koinly? Is there a crypto transaction aggregator that allows you to create a report to pass on to a tax preparer? Thank you for any insights!"

I don't know who to believe, my two friends, or the hundreds of reviews of utter disaster such as people getting their accounts frozen for months or their money taken and account closed with no reason, or people who can't even login. I live in New York and so do my friends, and I know Coinbase has a New York State bitlicense, so I have a sneaky suspicion Coinbase is very nice to New Yorkers to keep their New York bitlicense, while scamming everyone else who live outside of New York. What do you think? Should I trust my friends and create an account?  Or heed all of the bad reviews and take a chance getting scammed."
2/3/23,issue still not solved. Case# 14739528,"i made a post few days ago

 Case# 14739528 

i was contacted by email from coinbase. they instructed me to verify id and change 2FA. i provided and did everything as asked. even got an instant reply that things should be done within 48 hrs. and nothing has happened so far. still not getting sms for 2FA and now im basically stuck in this bs. 

whats funny is that when they sent me link via sms for verifying id, the sms came right through without any problems but that doesnt seem to work when i need the 2FA codes"
2/3/23,Coinbase lost all my transaction history since 2017,"Just would like to share that coinbase seems to have lost the transactions history i did with them since i first open the account (around 2017 if i remember well). This is a big problem for me as i won't have any proof in case of a tax double check request. I used Gdax at the time ant then Coinbase pro... all lost. They suggest me to use cointracker, really? WTF !!! it should be basic to be able to download the transaction history and not lose it... not for coinbase. Never again.

Be advised

Edit: i must admit that it wasn t their fault but mine.
Somehow i have an email associated with coinbase and a different email associated with Gdax and Coinbase Pro and i forgot about that as i haven t used their exchanges in a while. 
Within the latest email they reminded me that my gdax and coinbasePro account were associated with a different email than the one i was using to contact them.

I feel like an idiot ... But in the end at least this post solved the problem. Thanks"
2/3/23,"Coinbase locked me out of $20,000.","I made a video just to document the conversation.

First, several days after deposit when trying to send the money to KuCoin I get a notice saying that my account will be locked for an additional 7 days.

No notification or anything. I find out through customer service that somehow I stopped short of completing my ID verification. But I have an email from 10/22/22 telling me I’m verified.

So, I move to cash out and send the money back to the bank. I get 2 errors. One, when I use the cash out all button, I get an error that the amount is too large and I have too little money in my account.  Then the second one flat out says that I have $0 in my account.

At this point I had already asked if there was a block from me sending the money back home. Sheilo says no.

As I look through my email I find two interesting emails. One from may 2022 saying that if I don’t verify by July XX that my account will be limited to withdrawal only. Apparently I was able to use it until October, if this is even the reason that I verified my account.

And here is the kicker. When I mentioned that date in October. It was replaced with * like I said 3 dirty words between slashes, sheilo kind of as if they are on the phone says,- what I didn’t get that, the next message says they’re closing the chat and they ended our session.

I took a video of the whole thing for my records. I’m glad that I did because it wasn’t long at all that I was unable to refer back into the conversation.

Is there any recourse other than contacting our attorney generals and asking for help?

It’s been 2 weeks no change."
2/3/23,ETH Missing from Coinbase Wallet,"I lost some ETH a few weeks ago, it had been sent from my CB Wallet to an address I didn't recognize. I just assumed that I had screwed up and sent it to the wrong address.

But it happened again yesterday. 1 ETH vanished, again sent to a mysterious address (a different one this time). Can't be a coincidence.

I guess my question is there any recourse, any help I can get to investigate? Has anyone else had a similar experience?"
2/3/23,Canadian Coinbase support person telling me there is no longer any way to fund accounts,"I'm being told that as of the last month, credit cards, interac, bank transfer AND debit cards won't be allowed for depositing or withdrawing on Coinbase for Canadian accounts. 

So I can send and receive crypto from other wallets but I can't buy or sell it with Coinbase. They are saying it's temporary (they give no timeline on a fix) but I've spoken to 4 support agents today and only one told me this stuff.

Anyone else know anything about this?

Don't click my user profile please, you've been warned, it's very NSFW."
2/3/23,Still Having issue CSA Help.,The issue I'm having is I tried to log in another way. Did the photo ID etc. It's saying you have to do a manual review by March 4th your maintenence day. I use direct deposit etc so I have no way to access to sale etc so I can use my funds. Appreciate the help.
2/3/23,Unable to process your gift card redemption at this time?,"I bought several Coinbase gift cards from card cash and was able to redeem a few yesterday. But, today, I am getting only message "" We are unable to process your gift card redemption at this time"". I just researched online and there are a lot of complaints with no answer from Coinbase. I called Coinbase customer service, but unable to talk with anyone. 

Two things, according to coinbase website, there never mention about this risk or their policy for limitaiton what so ever,but they hold money illegally with high interest from customers while no support and cannot redeem with useless card. I think that we should sue Coinbase with this kind of fraudulent management."
2/3/23,Changed phones account locked [CSA help],I switched phones and took photos etc. Just wanna make sure everything's OK cause that's my only income as I have direct deposit.
2/3/23,Password reset loop,"I have been trying for 2 weeks now to get support from Coinbase without any luck. I have received an email to reset my password, and every time I change the password and try to connect, I am asked again to reset my password. I have tried this on 3 different devices, from 2 different browsers, same result, and nobody seems to be able to help me. I did follow all the steps, I even sent screenshots of the whole process. This is extremely frustrating."
2/3/23,Account currently blocked,I had tried to verify my Id in order to send a transaction today and after i verified it said my account was locked and when i try to login it says i’m currently blocked.
2/3/23,Coinbase Has Frozen 20k for 2 Months,"I've been a Coinbase user for over 5 years. Recently I moved relatively larger amounts than normal for me onto Coinbase, bought crypto and then transferred the majority of it into my private wallets because only an idiot would keep most of their funds on an exchange given the recent bankruptcies and fraud in the space, and of course the risk of hacks.

Additional deposits were made last week, left my bank and were supposed to be released by Coinbase this week. However upon trying to move some of the crypto into my private wallets, my account has been completely frozen and I'm being told I won't have access to the funds until the third week of April. Coinbase has also frozen my ability to trade.

I've already provided the source of funds and affirmed that the wallets I've moved the funds to are my own and that I did so for security reasons.

I'm contemplating contacting some higher ups via LinkedIn as I previously worked in the industry but I'm hoping Coinbase will do the right thing and release my funds instead of holding them hostage for nearly 2 months for no good reason.

Case reference number is 14772839."

2/3/23,USDT C-Chain Deposited to Coinbase and did not arrive,"I was expecting a payment in USDT C-Chain and the funds never arrived in my wallet despite a previous payment successfully being deposited into the account a month ago. 

Come to find out that the wallet address changes every month for ""security"" reasons and the funds were sent to a private Coinbase wallet. I am being told that they cannot retrieve the money and that they do not support this type of crypto through this network yet. 

How can I get the funds back? The transaction a month ago worked out just fine and suddenly it didn't. Does anyone have any idea what can be done in this situation?"
2/3/23,How can you tell someone they have till the end of the month to submit ID but then block them from trading? How is that protection? I wouldn't of sent money to coinbase if I knew I wasn't allowed to trade anymore. So once I do sort things I will be looking else where.,"Waiting for the price to settle as there was a little pump just before I was going to buy crypto. Go to trade to be stopped by a total lie

""Before making your first purchase, please verify your identity. Identity verification helps us ensure the safety and security of your Coinbase account.""

It's not my first trade, I don't feel safe as I'm now stuck. It's pretty mean thing to do. So without saying it all the profanities you can think of are you coinbase.  


The ID verification system is broken too. I upload ID and then a returns to the start again. FFS I want to smash something, never again coinbase. I was waiting for the price to settle as sometimes when sending crypto it fails and takes a hour before you can try again. Didn't want to be stuck in a dump while I sent my crypto to where I want it."

2/3/23,Invest in Gold with Easygold Token's Security Token Offering,"In times of economic uncertainty, investing in gold is a popular choice for those seeking lower downside risks. With the increasing geopolitical instability and inflation rates, the global financial market has become increasingly unstable. Easygold Token, the first security token that allows investors to invest in gold seamlessly, securely, and profitably through profit participation rights, comes as a solution.

Easygold Token's investment process is simple yet effective. The company acquires raw gold, processes it into high-quality gold bars, sells it on the market, and then reinvests the profit in the same cycle. With a track record of over 1,000 customers and successful operations over the last two years, Easygold Token is a trustworthy company. The company has been featured in renowned online media such as Bloomberg, Wallstreet Online, Focus, and Welt.

Investing in Easygold Token offers a range of benefits. The company's process of gold acquisition and processing has been perfected through combined experience, allowing it to reach maximum efficiency. Investors can receive up to a 50% profit participation, which is the highest percentage among all current competitors. Moreover, the investment is secure, as Easygold Token ensures a solid price floor for its security token by investing 100% of the funds in gold. The funds are locked in an Escrow contract by an independent third party, ensuring investor security.

Easygold Token has released its security token (EASG) on the Ethereum platform according to the ERC 1400 standard. The token entitles its holders to profit participation rights of up to 50% of the net-profit made by Easygold. The dividend payouts will commence in EASG tokens, for which purpose a certain amount of the total distribution will be reserved and subsequently released at the end of every calendar year. Investors who hold their EASG tokens for ten years will be eligible for the highest percentage of profits, which can reach up to 50%.

Investors can purchase Easygold Token's security token through the Security Token Offering (STO), which has a hard cap of 600,000,000 EUR. The company will be releasing 646,250,000 EASG tokens in the STO for a price of 1 EUR. A private sale will begin on 1 March 2023, with 125,000,000 EASG tokens available for purchase at a price of 0.75 EUR with a bonus of 25% for early adopters.
