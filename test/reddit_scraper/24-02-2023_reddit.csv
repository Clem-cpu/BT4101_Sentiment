23/2/23,Thank you r/cryptoCurrency for completely turning my life around.,"First of, I apologize for the grammar, English is not my first language.

This subreddit gets mentioned a lot for giving out terrible advise and how doing the exact opposite is actually the best way of going about it.

This might be true for some of you but for me it really helped me A LOT.

&#x200B;

I found this subreddit nearly 2 years ago and it actually changed my life.

I used to be always broke and actually terrible at managing money.

&#x200B;

Drunken poker sessions tilting it all away? Check.

Spending too much money on weed, booze and other drugs? Check.

Spending way too much on magic cards? Check.

Going to the clubs not caring about how much I would spend? Check.

As you can tell I was just the worst.

&#x200B;

But then I found r/cryptocurrency

&#x200B;

At first I was like - 'yea let's buy some of this crypto, I also want to be rich and fuck knows I 'need' the money'

But then I started reading more and more and seeing how patient, logical and responsible some of you are it made me realise what an idiot I was.

&#x200B;

So what changed you ask? A LOT.

&#x200B;

**Security:**

I used to just download whatever I'd like on to my PC without a care in the world.

I knew my email was hacked but just did not care.

I had like 2 passwords for everything ( and they we're very similar  )

Now I have a separate clean laptop just for crypto.

Now I have 2FA on everything.

Now I use a password manager.

Recently bought a hardware wallet!

&#x200B;

**Money management:**

As I said I was always broke spending without any regard for the future. Now I am saving a decent chunk of my income each month and have strict DCA days.

I track my expenses and think about ways to save more money and spend smarter.

No more poker ( I am terrible at it anyway )

Quit magic ( it's dying anyway )

&#x200B;

**Health:**

I stopped smoking completely and drink about every other weekend.

Started working out and feel just so much better.

&#x200B;

So, from the bottom of my heart.

THANK YOU r/CRYPTOCURRENCY

<3

10 hours ago Coinbase tweeted out a cryptic tweet, it's a blue dot  within a black background which fades away and the date 02.23.23 is shown before fading to black again.

using our powers of deduction we can conclude that they will announce something tomorrow, the question is what are they announcing?

23/2/23,Making moons almost compulsory to retain makes it looks like a shitcoin from an Investor's perspective.,"If you plan on earning moons it is compulsory to hold 75% of the moons to avoid a penalty. Selling all your earned moons basically means no more earning moons in the future.

No matter what reason are given it is very obvious this rule is implemented to maintain an inflated price that untimely benefits the whales.

This sound like The squid game token *with extra steps.*

Whales and top earners can easily sell 25% of their moons every month and still gain significant money.

Its promoting holding just so the price doesn't tank. Although it is said it is to promote governance proposals which make sense as they need certain threshold. But this looks like an excuse from the point of view of an investor.

# It's just not a good look where prices are stable not organically but because its forced. This holding is not the same as investors holding because they believe in the project.

This just calls for a massive dump when the prices soar.

Edit : I'm not complaining or asking for a change. But this is what I think the investors out of this sub would think. I'm getting downvoted to oblivion here"

No. Let's go further back for a minute

Back in 17th century Europeans traded with New England Natives, but the natives didn't use silver or gold, they used durable skeleton parts of their pray. Mostly sea-shell money - wampum, strung onto pedants. Wampump that spread far away from clam's habitat into other tribes. They also used teeth, furs, made artful blades and necklessess. Blades that weren't made for cutting but for sheer enjoyment. Collecting and decorating things originates all back to Africa. People like doing things for fun, it's irrational and not practical but we do it. We trade with it or pass it to our children. Like some animals, humans learned that non-kin altruism grew community stronger and put trust in it's members but people can only track a certain number of people.  

**Internet and now social apps let us scale much more.**

Just like primitive people's traditional craftmanship and folklore, nowadays there is huge number of intangible things that people find value in. Supporting your football club, company's logos branding, memorabilia, deep feeling for you country and dying for beliefs. **Moons and broader Avatars, represent more then lines of code and can spread much further from our community.** 

 We put our emotions, thoughts and feelings into our contributions and grow our community . Tipping makes our community stronger. Moons represent our journey and place in the community. **This fundamental idea that you can capture and store value created by your contributions to the Community is a new paradigm in using social apps.** Moons are proof that you own that something.

**Reddit's idea to decentralize the platform and give us this freedom to transact the wealth generated by our digital identities is unique in social app sphere and will change the very underlying fabric of social apps.** 

$1 Moons with only like $100m mcap is safe to say will be just the beginning. Big exchanges listings, hype and media that will follow will bring huge influx of new people lining up to join us, earn Moons and we will grow, change and work things out together.

**Moons are special and we are just getting started!**

You could trace the pokemon from the time it was caught and traded for the lifetime of the mon.

Not only that but attributes could be linked to the specific mon thru blockchain and this could be implemented into the breeding system.

It seems impossible to keep up with the news and manipulation of too many coins at once. My approach to crypto investing started by casting a wide net and buying into the hot coins being pumped everywhere. But now only consists of less than five coins. I feel a much stronger conviction to a smaller bag than when I was holding small amounts of many coins.

It also seems like this is a better risk management approach. I think my goal of getting rich overnight with crypto has matured into an expectation of achieving smaller gains over a longer period of time. Crypto is now part of my retirement plan and not my Lambo plan."

The new Base L2 launched by Coinbase is a centralized mess (just like all the other rollups like Optimism or Arbitrum on mainnet) and there's no more excuses. They are all controlled by a 4/6 multisig, 4 people control your funds, it is worse than a bank.

Is it too much to ask out of this industry to not have centralized VC garbage that can be rugged entirely by a few insiders?

But I’m curious what everyone’s thoughts are on this.

If crypto didn’t see the bull market you’re expecting, and instead everything remained flat/crabbed. At what point would you consider stopping your DCA strategy and/or selling?

For me, I’d probably reassess my strategy around July 2025. If I didn’t see any sort of gains by then, I’d either considerably reduce my DCA amount or stop altogether and just Hodl.

I’m probably going to get flamed and/or trolled. But I think having a solid short and long term strategy is ideal."
23/2/23,A reminder to open your Reddit vault!,"I just had a look at the round 36 distribution of Moons...

A total of 10,750 users received Moons, but 509 of those users (4.73% of everyone who earned Moons this round) don't have a vault.

The biggest pay-out of Moons, to a user without a vault, was 2,089 Moons, valued at around $350!

40,489 Moons (3.78% of the total amount this round), worth roughly $6,879, were earned by users without a vault.

I believe that Moons distributed to users without a vault are able to be claimed, but I don't know if there's a time limit for doing so? Open your vaults, people!"
23/2/23,Moon Metrics (Moontrics) - Round 36,"I love spreadsheets, graphs, data and crypto. So I've collected all the data posted in the Moon distribution .CSV files, made some sense of it all in a spreadsheet, then made us some graphs.

# Total Karma

The Sum of all the karma per round

A 4% decrease since the last round. I've added the average BTC price for the 28 day Moon round to this graph as the total karma has seemed to move up and down in line with its price. I've done other analysis posts that show we get activity spikes when BTC fluctuates, with the most happening during dips as it seems that misery likes company.   
The spike at round 33 was probably from all the FTX bullshit and the 700 news link posts about it every hour.

I'd expect roughly the same amount of karma next round, but who knows what shit will go down in the next few weeks.

# The ratio of Moons to karma

https://preview.redd.it/28dkbixlawja1.png?width=1413&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4fda907652dd318c5adc28a778a4b860e159dd95

The all important Moon to karma ratio. Multiply this number by your karma score to determine how many Moons you receive for each round. (Round 12 - 0.88 [Never Forget](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mvzv9v/anyone_remember_that_time_last_week_when_the_moon/))

This number will naturally decline over time as the Moons released per round reduce by 2.5%.

Round 36 - HO-LEE-SHYTE  
The admins told us they were closing the testnet bridge and burning all the Moons, [one of the other mods made an announcement post to let everyone know](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/10srtbi/the_moons_bridge_to_arbitrum_nova_has_been/)   
We asked admins if half of the Moons would be re-introduced in the next round and they said 'nah'   
They were either lying, fucking with us, or they done fucked something up ^(It wouldnt be the first time they fucked something up) because half of those Moons were indeed re-introduced.   
An additional million Moons were added to the regular amount which more than doubled the ratio everyone was expecting. Crazy times  


# Number of users on .CSV

This shows the number of users who earned karma for each round. The lower orange line is users with an active vault at the time the .CSV was published.

The number of users with vaults at the time of publishing the data overall averages around 60%. This doesn't indicate that only 60% of the users claim their Moons though as you have 6 months from the distribution to open your vault and claim them.

# % of users with a vault

The spike from round 28 to 29 was caused by the implementation of CCIP 031 which removed vaultless users with less than 10 karma from the .csv

The increase in average and median from round 28 to 29 was also caused by the implementation of CCIP 031.

The average Moons earnt per user takes into account a lot of factors: number of users, Moon to karma ratio, the reduction in Moons being released per round and the total karma.  


Is weird how the ratio spike has increased the average but not the median.

23/2/23,"Reddit avatars , onboard new users to not only other nfts , but also cryptocurrency as a whole :","Reddit avatars onboarding process is very affective as we already know , But after users start trading these avatars , they will realize there is a cap on the amount of free transactions , so they will consider using a 3rd party to send their avatars such as os , once they get their wallet set up , they will realize they need gas fees , which at first can be gotten from a set up faucet for the reddit avatars , here they can also find that buying and selling these avatars is possible and can only be done through crypto , this may prompt them to purchase some crypto , likely leading them to learn more untill they are fully onboarded to the crypto community as well.

One of the reasons this is affective is because Reddit has broken up the big hurdles into several small road bumps , since the vault is aldready set up with a seed , they have a goal to accomplish via crypto (trade or do more with their avatars) and finally an incentive to purchase more crypto after the road bumps of setting up a wallet , and using web 3 technology have been cleared."
23/2/23,Why self-custody is important and why you should move your coins off the exchange and keep them in your own wallet.," “Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.” – Satoshi Nakamoto, circa 2009 

When the 2008 financial crisis hit big banks basically destroyed the world's economy and got away with it. Only a few countries actually did something about it.

* Iceland cleaned the house and jailed over 25 bankers for their shady practices,
* Spain jailed 11,
* Ireland only 7.

Guess how many were jailed in the US? Only one. That's right, and he was just a small fry. Wasn't even a major CEO or anything. He was just a trader. Got only 2 years and 6 months in prison. It's a joke. And what banks got in return for destroying the world's economy? A bailout. Taxpayers basically paid for everything. That's why I invest in crypto. Because I know that the game is rigged against us the regular people.

Small people like me and you take the biggest hit every single time. We lose our savings, we lose our jobs while they are fine laughing and plotting another scheme to mess things up. Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) that brought the world's finance system to its knees in 2008 are being abused again by financial institutions, but this time banks call them Bespoke Tranche Opportunities (BTO). It's basically the same thing. They just changed the name. They haven't learned anything because nobody got punished last time.

  
They don't care about any of us. And I feel like crypto is the only way out for us. 

That's why self-custody is important. Don't trust exchanges, don't trust banks, don't trust corporations. Get yourself a good hardware wallet, or even a paper wallet but keep it safe. Don't share it with anyone. Do your due diligence and let's avoid another FTX disaster."
23/2/23,"Even short-term holders are holding onto their assets for longer than usually right now, indicating that even they expect the market to go up further.","Generally we always seem to be associating short-term holders with people that buy the asset and quickly sell it as they have no believe in any kind of a long-term value and are often very bearish towards the assets, hence the name short-term holder. This may not be true at all as short-term holders are present even in bull markets and that often in en even larger amount.

One on-chain datapoint of short-term holders that distinguishes bull market from bear market is the so-called “Dormancy“, which is the holding period short-term holders hold onto their coins on an average. Yes, even short-term holders can hold for a longer period or shorter one.

* STH  (short-term holder) holding for a short period = bear market as the depressing price movements motivate for a quicker sale.
* STH holding for a longer period = bull market as the upwards price movements motivate them to hold longer for more profits

Now, this chart shows the shift between STH holding longer and shorter and just recently we have got a shift upwards. SHort-term holders are holding longer onto their coins right now as they hope for even greater returns.

The fact that EVEN short-term holders are move confident in the market just shows how much more confidence in the market has been restored even from the most bearish groups. Let me know about your opinions:"
23/2/23,Are you honestly addicted to crypto?,"Are you addicted to crypto?

Many people call crypto “The Casino” and many of us treat it as so. 

We all know, have seen a movie with, or have came across a gambling addict in our lives. The situation usually isn’t pretty. 

The rise of online exchanges, trading platforms and 22,000 ish tokens have created some pretty unique opportunities to make risky decisions from the comfort of our homes. 

This begs the question: 

Are you honestly addicted to crypto? 

If so, explain your situation. Maybe you day trade aggressively, stare at the charts all day, spend all of your money earned in the fist mines DCA-ing into shit coins or spend all day shit posting for moons. 

Perhaps you have witnessed a friend or family member spiral out of control and lose everything? 

What’s your story? 

****Disclaimer - Gambling can be a serious problem and can result in job loss, family stress, ruined relationships and more I’m not making light of gambling addiction with this post. If you’re suffering, please seek help!****

23/2/23,Is anyone not investing in BTC or ETH and only investing in shit coins?,"Do you feel like you're already behind in the crypto game if you haven't invested in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH)? According to my experience, these two coins are the main players in the market, and if you're not putting at least a small amount into them, you're probably not that interested in crypto.

Personally, I'm all-in on ETH at the moment, but I still think BTC is the safer bet. BTC has always been the king of crypto, and I believe it will continue to hold that position. However, ETH is currently ahead of any other Layer 1 (L1) blockchains, although there's always room for improvement.

That said, I'm also keeping an eye on other L1s that could potentially take over ETH's second place if they offer faster and cheaper transactions without relying on Layer 2 (L2) solutions.

But wait, there's more! While my portfolio is mostly composed of major coins like MATIC, ADA, and CRO, I'm also keeping a few small market-cap coins for potential moon shots. I'm curious, though: are any of you investing purely in ""shitcoins""? What makes you choose them over the ""safer"" bets like BTC and ETH?

&#x200B;

edit.

To all people who took offence to me saying ""shitcoins"" obviously they're not all shit its just a  funny collective name. Stop taking offence. I own plenty of them and obviously don't consider them all to be shit."

I've considered one of those services for example emails provide that if the account isnt logged on in X time it sends a pre-defined email into pre-defined addresses. Perhaps better not to put actual seeds into that though.. so then would still have to figure out an actual safe way to store the seeds that the email could lead to.

23/2/23,International Monetary Fund released a paper today stating that cryptocurrency should not be granted legal tender status to safeguard monetary sovereignty and stability.,"This doesn't come as a big surprise to anybody but it's still interesting to view their biggest fears and concerns.

International Monetary fund paper can be found here.

[https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Policy-Papers/Issues/2023/02/23/Elements-of-Effective-Policies-for-Crypto-Assets-530092?cid=pr-com-PPEA2023004](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Policy-Papers/Issues/2023/02/23/Elements-of-Effective-Policies-for-Crypto-Assets-530092?cid=pr-com-PPEA2023004)

I've highlighted some of the points that stood out to me and posted them below.

&#x200B;

first element is to safeguard monetary sovereignty and stability by strengthening monetary policy and not granting crypto assets official currency or legal tender status.

https://preview.redd.it/0cy2wuyd6zja1.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ba428894118a918215ad92f7dd03100e2f38f9ef

one of the risk they point out is that households will invest in crypto assets that are not pegged to fiat currency. why would we want something pegged to highly inflationary fiat currency?

https://preview.redd.it/6jz9ezyd6zja1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3fd5c9f3b673e3b7cc8b7e0af0de41eb521c2172

they argue that pricing items in crypto would waist the merchants time because they would have to constantly monitor the market and adjust pricing due to the instability of crypto prices.

https://preview.redd.it/0xcw51zd6zja1.png?width=633&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=658c004492d2ad4452c2ee924e89f65aa05e83f9

and the biggest reason to not grant cryptocurrencies legal tender status - because they are not issued by the government.

they make a point that a government issued cryptocurrency or digital asset would be different because the government would be the one backing it.

https://preview.redd.it/6vzohuyd6zja1.png?width=579&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5c912a5e4f11da8d62e507d1305f15aa652c3e4a

another big point for them to have to work together is that crypto is borderless and if one government is against crypto alone it can't really stop anything since people can still use somewhere else.

https://preview.redd.it/4qwrtxyd6zja1.png?width=609&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=76e4d5191cf8ae764cf1e8e19b0b85eec2e7b1f1

Widespread adoption would also have significant implications for the international monetary system in the long term - 

this is the entire point of crypto.

It's not surprise that the IMF would try to advise against granting cryptocurrencies any kind of legal tender status, they fear losing the control over citizens finances they currently have."
23/2/23,What's your realistic goal for the next bull run?,"Sure we all dream of becoming millionaires buying lambos and living the high life, but what's the real goal for the next cycle? Is it to be debt free? Almost debt free? Enough to buy a house or a car? Or is it just a number?

I'm certainly not saying we're in a bull market, and I don't think one is necessarily on the horizon. In fact, I hope it holds off for a good while so I can keep accruing in my tiny increments. I've stacked enough this winter to have more money than I've ever had come next bull run, but that's not my goal. I'm trying to be debt free and have a little (or a lot) extra. I need more time for this to happen. I'm not a trader so my DCA is basically what I have to rely on. I probably won't reach my goal, but hopefully I get close.

I'm sure the next run will make some millionaires out of some of us, but what about the rest? Let's hear what you got, and good luck in your journey."
23/2/23,What was your first bag? Do you still have it? How did it perform?,"Just wanting to see what were the first bags you some you went in on?  Do you still currently have it or did you sell?  How has it or did it perform?  Do you believe in the project or just think it has the ability to make you some money?  What made you start with that particular coin/token? 

My first bag was Stellar Lumens back in early 2020 and it basically hovered for the longest time and then eventually I sold to profit a few hundred dollars.  I really thought the project would grow huge and what is funny is the price per coin is currently not much higher than when I bought back then.

23/2/23,What is the most unpopular (but sounds true) opinion about crypto?,"The worst one that I heard was that Bitcoin was invented as a mean to control the masses' money, from all around the world (Tin foil hats required?). 

With a 6.1 million members and around 6.1 thousand active users, it would be awesome to hear all the various opinions circulating. All the way from it being created by an all seeing alien, to it never reaching the mass adoption level and slowly fading away.

Or is crypto just repeating all the mistakes of traditional markets? Let's hear them all.

23/2/23,How much money have you lost and on what projects?,"I’m always curious to see how much money people have lost and what their future plans are with the projects they have lost money on. 

I’ll start off by saying I’ve lost over 20k on CRO. I am currently holding as taking a L on that much money would hurt too much.

Next is LRC. I’ve lost 1k on LRC. I’ve sold it when it was near the bottom and now I see it going up. (pain)

Next is ADA. I’ve got ADA at a good price for just under a $1. I bought a lot and ended up being up over 16k when it was at $4. Sadly I didn’t sell and now I am holding at a lost of around 3k. I believe it will rise again and will sell when I’m up.

Next is Polkadot. I bought over $1000 worth when it was at over $45 per coin. Watching it drop to under $10 hurt and i’ve sold that coin at a loss.

The only coins i’ve made money on and are up on is Moons, ETH, BTC, and Doge. Doge was the only coin i’ve successfully bought and sold at a profit.

The biggest lesson i’ve learned from losing over 24k on crypto is to take profits. I am now just waiting for the next bull run so I can hopefully make my money back on CRO, and ADA. Soon as I break even I plan to sell.

I am wondering now how much money you’ve lost, on what projects, and what was the biggest lesson you learned?

TLDR: Investing in Crypto gone wrong, down lots."

23/2/23,Reddit will announce market place before Gen 3,"Gen 2 Avatars sold out in 48 hours I think, the popular ones went way faster. Reddit knows these are gonna sell out fast and start selling on secondary markets. 

They’re going to want to capitalize on that so they either make them more expensive, mint more, or get in on the secondary sales. In my opinion it makes way more sense to introduce their market for buying, selling, and trading and then drop Gen 3 so they get the secondary revenue. 

The only benefit to Reddit for an instant sell out is press, but they don’t make more money directly. If they had all the hype of the Gen 3 drop on their own platform it would get way more interaction and instantly return revenue. 

TLDR: Reddit would be missing out on a lot if they don’t introduce their own market place before Gen 3."
23/2/23,What are your thoughts on Cardano?,"I for one have held ADA quite a few times, but have been discouraged because of Charles Hoskinson and his ego. 

I also think there are better blockchains than Cardano, for instance, **Algorand** and **Ethereum**.

(I do not hold ALGO)

I've noticed the shillers in this sub who are die hard ADA supporters, but that just might be because of the bags they hold and the fact that they might have lost money and that they are only holding onto hope at this point for it to go back up to it's all time high again.

Personally speaking, I see no future in it, especially with Ethereum's Layer 2 solutions like, **Optimism**, **Arbitrum**, and even **Loopering,** and of course, **Polygon**.  Even saw a post earlier that Polygon co-founder saying their is no future in it(I'll take his opinion with a grain of salt). Truth is, and it's been said many times over ""We don't know shit about fuck"".

I for one though, have a bigger feeling that Cardano will turn into nothing. I believe it'll be a blockchain that gets left behind, kinda like the start ups from 2017. 

with that being said, I would also like to hear your opinions on the matter of Cardano and can we at least try to be a little unbiased?"

Thanks U.K. government."
23/2/23,A discussion - could Reddit Moons be considered a security by the SEC?,"We’ve seen the recent SEC enforcement actions against Kraken’s staking, stablecoins such as Binance’s BUSD (which has caused it to stop being issued by Paxos and billions of dollars to flow out of the coin), not to mention the ongoing case against XRP. Could this sort of action be done against Moons? It depends on whether the SEC could view them as an unregistered security.


Let’s define a security. As a layperson with an interest in crypto, not a financial professional, I’ll do my best: there’s something called the Howey test that helps determine what counts as a security. “Under the Howey Test, a transaction qualifies as a security if it involves the following four elements: 
1. An investment of money
2. In a common enterprise
3. A reasonable expectation of profit
4. Derived from the efforts of others”
[source](https://www.embroker.com/blog/what-is-the-howey-test-does-crypto-pass/#what_is_the_howey_test)


For a crypto to qualify as a security (and in the SEC’s eyes, an unregistered security, which opens it up to their enforcement), it would have to meet **all 4** of the above criteria. A clear **no** would be Bitcoin: there’s no overall owner/distributor, and no profits are assured. (And if you’re like me buying the top, losses are expected). The SEC has determined most ICOs to be a **yes**, with more than half their 2022 lawsuits targeted at ICOs. Especially targeted by the SEC as unregistered securities are coins/tokens that raise funds via their own tokens to further develop their own coin/product. 


Where do Moons fit in to this? They’re freely given, so probably don’t meet criteria #1. That said, they’re on main net now and can be purchased (and sold) on exchanges. So that could loosely be interpreted as meeting Howey #1. And #2 also, since they’re issued initially from Reddit, not a decentralized source. #3  - well, Moons are Reddit’s Community Points, designed and marketed as a governance token, which strongly makes the case that they’re *not* securities as there’s no advertised nor expressed expectation to profit from Moons. #4 is about whether the profit from an investment is outside of an investor’s control. Since Moons already aren’t being given with a reasonable expectation of a profit, I’d say this one doesn’t apply. 


So taking it all together - it seems like currently Moons don’t pass the Howey test, so they don’t qualify as a security and shouldn’t seem likely to face the wrath of the SEC. **Woohoo!** That said, things can change. If Reddit started selling Moons directly, or even accepting them as payments, that could change some of the above answers. And who knows if SEC will decide to change what rules they apply to who.

(Original post got removed immediately due to too many Moons posts in top 50)

**TLDR;** Reddit Moons don’t currently seem to pass the Howey test - seemingly not a security at the moment and hopefully not in the SEC crosshairs!"
23/2/23,"Its ""China Coins season"" as China pumps money into the market, support Hong Kong as a crypto hub, and coins like VET, CKB, FIL, and NEO outperform the rest of the market","Last year in December I called the AI coin narrative. It's time for a new narrative in 2023: China coins. The idea is simple, all coins related to China are pumping and will continue to pump.

There's two new developments. First, China decided to inject a ton of liquidity (money) into the market as their economy and currency are not doing so well.

# Evidence for the narrative

Since the start of the year till the high:

* VET pumped 114%
* CKB pumped 207%
* NEO pumped 157%
* DOT pumped 84%
* EOS pumped 53%

23/2/23,How not to FOMO - a simple guide,"I would argue that everyone's goal here is to stack as much BTC as possible before the next bull run. In doing so many will resolve to buying popular alts hoping that they would outperform BTC.

In 2022 many have fallen into this trap FOMOing into overvalued alts at their pico top. In order to not make such mistakes it is VERY useful to look at ALT/BTC charts.

Let's take MATIC as a quite popular option recently. If you take a look at MATIC/USD chart it says MATIC is ¬$1.4... which is an okay price... nothing wrong with it. 

[MATIC \/ USDT on a weekly timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/bocortdzhyja1.png?width=1326&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ebed6497fc6df329caca274744d2961a81d4c16a)

It used to be ¬$3.0 so not a big issue... still looks cheapish. But then if you take a look at MATIC/BTC chart... you see this:

[MATIC \/ BTC on a weekly timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/i7gx2suuhyja1.png?width=1321&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2982ed94c8ca2dc49476474d0fec9fe1deb57281)

MATIC is almost at all time high in its valuation against Bitcoin. 

If you wanted to buy altcoin which would outperform BTC in the near future I would argue that there are much better options.

Examples of some alts that are not hyped right now and might be undervalued against BTC.

Of course no one can be 100% sure what will happen in the future but at least we can make sure that we are not playing against the odds. The worst thing you can do is get into an already popular option. It will by definition be overvalued against BTC.

23/2/23,A Few Thoughts and Predictions on Bitcoin and the US Dollar,"**Bitcoin**:

The value gap ($24.4k to $30k) I highlighted previously is still acting as resistance. Value gaps are a range of low volume (per price) and an inefficiency in the market that can sometimes act as resistance. In this case, it rejected Bitcoin twice since the summer of 2022.

Part of me wants a stronger rejection so I can get a good DCA entry but 2/3 of retracements past 90 days were bullish, and while momentum indicates some exhaustion on lower timeframes, thats not the only factor.

The ideal scenario for **bulls** is a swing down to \~22.9k before rallying for another shot at penetrating the value range. If bulls recover $25k, I would expect consolidation before any attempts to tackle $30k. Recovering $30k would lead Bitcoin (and the larger market) to the next higher value range between $30k and $40k.

The ideal scenario for **bears** is losing a couple levels of support (listed in earlier posts). $20.8k goal for bears, with a weekly close under that invalidating the uptrend. That might not lead to significant downside, but could return to a bearish crab and revisit the upper teens. I feel that new lows are unlikely as it took very significant events (Luna, FTX) to reach them last time; overall the market is much healthier today than in mid 2022.

[Bitcoin with the value gap highlighted](https://preview.redd.it/awdarc4a8yja1.png?width=3668&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=83b07071af112ca05f053bb3b595caeff0c8bd63)

**US Dollar Index**:

February was a month of moderate recovery for the US Dollar Index (DXY). After an incredible rally through 2022, peaking in Q4 at 114.7, the DXY began retracing to a critical level below 101.7.

Historically (7 times) closing below the 101.7 level signaled larger drops for DXY. It narrowly dodged that fate with a solid bounce and February rally back to 104.6.

For the past two weeks 104.6 acted as resistance. I think in part this is due to mixed economic data showing an inconsistent recovery, and its also unclear what peak rate will be and how long we maintain it.

The Euro is looking healthy with it's recovery since September ongoing. **This alone may be enough pressure to stifle a recovery for the Dollar**.

Of course I'm not an economist. There is room for more upside on the Dollar, but my gut tells me this is a small rally with more downside in the future, which is bullish for equities, crypto, etc.

[The US Dollar Index with key levels marked](https://preview.redd.it/nvk9059bayja1.png?width=3668&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1aa2729471b5ba81c9ba365a19b3858510fab442)

**Bottom Line - What does this mean?**

I expect increased volatility in the coming weeks. Even if the Dollar continues to drop and Bitcoin closes over $25k, there is a lot of volatility that accompanies an inefficiency in the market like that $25k-$30K value gap.

At the same time, while economic data is improving, its still mixed and some of the unknowns are jockeying markets up and down as the Fed and other government attempt to navigate a landing after a hard year+ of battling inflation.

I'm an active DCA'er since Q4 2022, but I've slowed my pace in this range. I'm not planning to sell, but I DCA less than I did from November to January. This is mostly because I think entries on any token or coin when Bitcoin was below $20k are going to remain as the floor and we are unlikely to see lower. It also reduces my tax liability if I hold through this year.

I've been noticing it for a long time, about a year, for example. I record there the purchase of 0.055 BTC for €100, but after a while, even if I don't set anything manually, it turns out that I bought the same 0.055BTC for €104 or €100.80 or 101,50€ etc… So, it sometimes randomly changes my total average price. For example, yesterday I had €24,590, today I have an average of €25,050 and I didn't buy anything in between, it just changed. 

One of my friends who I know personally has the same problem, but we can't figure out what could be causing it. I would like to stay with this app, but if it continues like this, I will try something else. I’m using it on Iphone if this is important.

Rules:
1. Set a target price: Before you start investing, set a target price at which you want to sell. This will help you avoid making emotional decisions and selling too early or too late. Accept that it will hurt if you sell too early AND if you sell too soon. 
2. Use stop-loss orders. Don’t be FTX
3. Don't get too greedy
4. Keep an eye on market indicators: there are 1 million YouTube videos about this. Spend time understanding what the fundamentals are. Do not pretend that next time will be different. I remember so many people were saying that a death cross wouldn’t be a big deal last bull run. “This time it’ll be different” is a red flag. 

Keep it simple. you have to sell at the right time AND buy at the right time. It’s up to you to decide when the right time is. If you’re trying to 2x or 100x your investment, have a plan and stick to it."

* Also, doesn't it make sense to have a single stable coin, not many?  Or will this be like credit cards where there are many different issuers /merchants?
* Any additional information on where the industry is going, how stable coins could be adopted and how companies like Tether or Circle make money would be helpful.

23/2/23,MOONs are boosting crypto learning curve that leads to mass adoption!,"Hi there fellow moonshiners!

I have some news for you if you didn't know already. MOON distribution among us folks here who post all day is getting us closer to mass crypto adoption and here's how and why, even if it may seem Aerospace Engineering stuff for some.

**The newb & CEX'es**

First of all, i was a complete newb in regards to whatever it was outside an Centralised Exchange! I had no notions and knowledge on how to actually move my funds elsewhere except buy and sell them on the same exchange. Let me tell you that thing is lvl 1 stuff.

This year i evolved and learned how to use a hardware wallet after multiple centralised exchanges dropping like flies. I learned how to move cryptos & tokens to the correct adresses and how to manage ""gas fees"". Most importantly i've secured myself from mostly all risks involved with a CEX. I am my own bank so i strongly suggest you do the same. 

**My own bank**

If Hardware wallet was lvl 2 crypto science, here i went to fell the tip of the iceberg, the what i call for me, level 3, connecting metamask to different chains that share the same adress and bridging funds between layers and also swapping stuff.

**Aerospace Engineering lessons**

It took me no less than 1 day of full research when i found out i had a few dozen of MOONS in my vault. I learned quickly i can make a good buck by selling them BUT here is where the fun started. Your Reddit Vault is basically a kind of wallet based on Arbitrum Nova layer 2 of Ethereum which holds MOON token issued by /r Cryptocurrency. I had no clue about this until i figured i couldn't send MOONS to a normal ETH adress without having some ETH for ""gas fees"". So, having no ""button"" to add eth for gas fees i found out that you need to connect your Reddit Vault Wallet to metamask by using your 12 word seedphrase. After that i had to find and add both Arbitrum One and Nova chains to the Ethereum Mainet adress of Reddit Vault that i just connected. After doing that stuff i needed to send some ETH from an Exchange or Hardware wallet to the ETH mainnet. Then i just found out about the huge ETH fees for a 20$ transaction. Took me about 3$ after setting the lowest GWEI. Then i found out that you can check GWEI oportunities on [Txstreet.com](https://Txstreet.com) and minimise the fees of sending ethereum. Soon after that i found out that to be able to send the ETH arrived in my ETH Mainnet (metamask) i coudn't just send it between chains without a ""bridge"" so i went to bridge to arbitrum website and tried to swap ETH from Mainet to Arbitrum Nova, where i need the ETH for gas fees. When i reached that point i just found that i needed another 8$ worth of ETH to be able to send the rest. After playing abit with GWEI price, my TX was pending forever, i accelerated it, didnt work, so i canceled. That cancel alone took another 2$. I was left with around 7-8$ out of 20$ with all the fees that ETH took away from me just to send ETH for GAS FEES! ... At that point i felt like giving up. I waited 15 min for ETH gas fees to arrive from ETH Mainnet to Arbitrum Nova next to ""MOON"" Token. Oh yea.. i also had to import MOON token to show up in metamask. 

&#x200B;

After every piece of this puzzle was set i could finally send MOON tokens to [Gate.io](https://Gate.io) (exchange) to sell for USDT and send it to my main exchange tied to the bank. But first i had to wait another hour for them to arrive and 15 minutes for the moons to be able to sell on limit order. 

**The Relief**

A tideous, rocket science task that will not be for many but surely this thought me the first most important steps of level 3 crypto science. This is the dark web of things in crypto, you either get it and try to pay attention to every little detail or your money gone 4 ever. This might have been a tutorial aswell for some of you that don't know what is the procedure. Feel free to ask, i can help you in the comments section. 

Last, MOONs are the best incentive you can get by just simply making posting good stuff that people love. It's the monetization of crypto, sort of like Youtube but ad-free. Those hard to learn procedures will toughen you and make you live and breathe crypto in it's fullest. You will love it.

&#x200B;

***TL;DR: Reddit Vault's MOON tokens are the best sort of incetives to make people learn the deepest parts of crypto and introduce them to the actual utility of crypto: blockchain transactions and many more. You get paid by just posting stuff here, but to be able to get your hands on the gold you need to pass a pretty difficult test.***"
23/2/23,Coinbase Joins the Ethereum Layer 2 Rat Race – Can It Grow?,
23/2/23,10-year Bitcoin holders are holding more BTC than ALL exchanges together and the trend is just getting worse and worse for exchanges.,"We always seem to have the conception here that Crypto exchanges are by far the most powerful entities in Crypto and can move markets just as they want. But in reality the power of exchanges has been decreasing for quite a while now and seems to have no sign of recovery right now. The Bitcoin supply on exchanges decreased form a peak of 3.2M BTC during 2020 to now 2.2M BTC.

While exchanges would usually stock up during bear markets, this time it just decreased further and one group of holders has even gained more supply than all exchanges together. The 10+ year holders of Bitcoin have gathered a staggering 2.6M BTC, which is 13.8% of the total supply.

&#x200B;

Here we can once again see that this cross happened in October 2022, not even that far away. Since then those „“ancient“ holders have more supply than those big centralized exchanges that probably have a lot of institutional investors behind them. This just happens to show that the power of holding is greater than the institutional and stealing-from-customers power.

Exchanges are seeing their value decrease more and more, now they either have to buy during the bull market at elevated prices (which would make the price sky-rocket even more in a bull) or they will slowly but steadily lose their influence while real holders will just keep increasing their strength.

Maybe even we will one day be more powerful than those CEX."

So I expect many of the active users in this sub to begin getting targeted via dms.

23/2/23,Most of us are in crypto mainly for money cause we are poor and poor people can't afford to not put money at 1st place.,"Only people that think money are not important and don't increase happiness are rich people. Yes money don't solve all problems, but they solve all problems that can be solved with money, so like 90% of them. Broken hearts or  all ideological discussions can't be healed or solved with money, but they doesn't matter when you have no roof over your head and bills to pay. Crypto is lifechanging for most of us, cause it can help  improve our living conditions. All rest is not that important and if you think privacy or tech are  much more important than money you probably live quite comfortable life.

Caring about tech, envirement, privacy and freedom is cool and fun if you have time and money for it. Most of us have neither, we are stuck in 9-5, eat shitty food, cause good food or going out to eat in restaurant is expensive, we have boring clothes we barely are able to pay rent. Not cause we want, just cause modern world is bad and to change our lives we need money. Throwing some noble causes and nice sounding slogans at people like us is disrespectful. If I will make money in crypto I will stop treating ""being profitable and safe"" as main thing, until then I  and most of us can't afford wasting time and effort on something that don't give us results.

Some coins like Monero or Nano have good tech behind them and also ideals like privacy. That's cool, but most of us won't buy them, cause they aren't profitable. I will chose Bitcoin all the times, cause even if BTC will do nothing it will still do better and be safer than them.

 I ended up choosing Veracity after some dozen hours of research on the developers, uses, and community. I overall ended up falling in love with the project and the whole idea of it. I still am.

I wanted to steer away from the Veracity and other gaming token communities to ask the broader crypto community what their thoughts are on not only specific gaming tokens, but the crypto gaming industry as a whole and whether or not you think it has a future. Is it wrong to have high hopes for coins in this sector?

22/2/23,Deutsche Bank Successfully Finishes Trial of Tokenized Investing Platform - The Daily Hodl,
23/2/23,The Rise of Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs),"Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have been gaining traction in the cryptocurrency market over the past few years, and it's easy to see why. Unlike centralized exchanges, which rely on a central authority to manage trades and hold user funds, DEXs are built on blockchain technology and operate in a decentralized manner. This means that users have greater control over their funds and can trade cryptocurrencies in a more secure and transparent environment.

One of the main benefits of DEXs is their resistance to hacks and security breaches. Since user funds are held in smart contracts on the blockchain, there is no central point of failure that can be exploited by hackers. This makes DEXs a more secure option for cryptocurrency traders, especially those who are concerned about the safety of their funds.

Another advantage of DEXs is their focus on privacy and anonymity. Unlike centralized exchanges, which often require users to provide personal information such as their name and address, DEXs allow users to trade cryptocurrencies without revealing their identity. This can be especially appealing to users who value their privacy and want to maintain control over their personal information.

Finally, DEXs offer greater accessibility to users around the world. Since DEXs are built on blockchain technology, they can be accessed from anywhere in the world, as long as the user has an internet connection. This makes it easier for users in countries with limited access to traditional financial systems to participate in the cryptocurrency market.

Looking ahead to 2023, DEXs are poised for significant growth as more users become aware of their benefits and as the technology behind them continues to improve. Some of the key developments that are likely to drive growth in the DEX market include the emergence of cross-chain interoperability, which will allow users to trade cryptocurrencies across different blockchains, and the integration of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, which will enable users to access a wide range of financial services on DEX platforms.

Decentralized exchanges are poised for growth in the coming years as more users recognize the benefits of trading cryptocurrencies in a secure, transparent, and decentralized environment. With ongoing innovation in the field, DEXs are likely to become an increasingly important part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem in the years to come."
23/2/23,I’m Scared But Holding - My First Crypto Winter,"Hello everyone,

This is my first crypto winter and things can take U-turns for the worse even if Putin Sneezes, Biden Falls, or Just It does because It Can, And yes because of exchanges being screwed! I’m scared!

Not holding any of my cryptos in exchange but still, the question arises in my mind how long this winter will be!! Though there are some Green Goblins Around but Still a Bear Market.

All my profits are wiped out! So I’m confused and don’t see any silver line here !!

I gave an attempt to understand the crypto winter and tried to analyze 2014, 2018, and 2020 winters but to my lame eyes, I don’t find any similarities - except one!

The only similarity they all have is the worst of expectations from everyone towards crypto and a complete sense of disbelief in crypto.

Right now I think people are in that zone and it’s my first and it makes me scared as hell because it is a rocky time.

I’m all for the diamond balls !! In times like these, the ""crypto winter"" my balls do shiver sometimes!!!

How was your experience with your first crypto winter?"
23/2/23,Why Bitcoin is more than just investment for me.,"Unlike FIAT, which we're obliged to use by our centralized institutions (governments and central banks), Bitcoin is operating in a free market. (Would love to see FIAT's behave in a free market). Despite of that, it's undeniable that its appearance showed the world people were craving for a deflactionary trustworthy alternative for a store of value (for the moment i'll go with this, although btc can be so much more) free of governmental hands. Because the truth is, it's almost impossible owning something without government knowing about it.


And yes, it's true that the biggest part of Bitcoin is routed by centralized exchanges, but we can't forget it's peer-to-peer, so in the future (with wider adoption) bitcoin could be a way of maintaining the anonimaty of paper money (that will disappear, sooner or later).


Bitcoin is also the first digital man made scarce asset, and a response to all the QE, wich is a way of robbery. Don't get me wrong: FIAT have enormous advantages on its side, such as salability and anonimaty. It's the most liquid way of money we'll have, but it's also debt created. Debt creation is literally how FIAT is mined. 

So, for me, bitcoin is revolutionary exactly because its innherent rules don't change and if that happens one day (51% attack), well, that day will be the last of bitcoin.

Bitcoin and FiAT will coexist, but bitcoin will incentivise saving and lower time preference. It has a powerfull ideia behind: no one has more power over the protocol, no matter how bitcoin possesses. So I DCA every month, not only because I expect BTC to value more in the future, but also because we need a shift in our economical paradigm. The quality of a society is as good as its means of exchange. We have to pass from a credit way of evolving to a savings way of evolving.

And that's why i'm not that concerned about short term bitcoin price. Bear market or bull market is the same, because I don't intend to change back to €€ the value I already own in satoshis, but rather using those satoshis to interact direclty with other economical pears in the future.

Hope this can calm and shinning some light to the most nervous of you guys. If not, well, at least I tried.

And sorry for my english, not a native speaker."
23/2/23,Do file storage and transfer blockchain projects appeal to science institutions?,"I've seen a few different blockchain projects related to data storage and transfer (eg. ARweave, file coin, WeSendIt). Have any 'big data' science projects or institutions bought in to the various file storage and transfer blockchain projects?  On paper these should appeal to any organization that routinely handles and distributes a lot of data. This immediately makes me think of applications to mega science projects like astronomical observatories, which can create terabytes of new data on a weekly basis (data which then needs to be distributed around the world to various scientists and collaborators.) Is there any reason why these projects would or would not be appealing to them? I presume that these institutions are already used to handling their data storage and distribution 'in-house', and for them to be interested in  blockchain services they would need to be cheaper than whatever the in-house cost is. I wonder how much of the absence-of-interest is due to the cost vs. simply the scientists in charge don't know about such block chain projects. Anyone looked into whether such blockchain projects would be competitive for such institutions?"

I met more great friends in cc ( not necessarily in cc subreddit, rather cc telegram)  than in any different single place ever. I was in many communities over the years as internet users, you know sites, games, forums, some people were cool, but I never felt true community or cared about anyone. On the other hand cc is whole different world.


Crypto  and cc connected me with people all over the world. I have friends from Iran, India, Philippines, France, Norway, Belgium, UAE, USA, Canada or Egypt. And many more places. I  am from europe, so I wouldn't ever have much contact with most of them if not crypto, so I am grateful for that.

I always thought and real life proved me right that people 10 or 20 years older than me are boring, have sticks in their asses and I have no common topics to talk with them. Only thing I could  safely talk with people in the age of my parents in real life is weather, cause they don't get any reference or joke.  While the same age people in crypto are much cooler, they share memes, laugh and are tech savy. Really refreshing to see. I guess it is not suprising, if you are in crypto you must be more open minded, cool and use internet more than most of the society."

23/2/23,To my beloved sub; a farewell post,"I want to start off by just giving my full thanks to the community for giving me a feeling of belonging. I do not want this to be a sad or sympathetic post. I will say however, we never know how a few kind words and involvement can feel for some people, especially with different backgrounds or at tougher times in their lives. 

You all played a huge part in lifting me up daily. An occasional compliment, the shared laughs, love and support, and achieving our common goals is what life is truly about. 

Some say crypto is about the money and it certainly coincides with it. Yet, a realization I had when I was much younger was; while I am living, it is a priority for me to contribute to acts of unity of our people here on Earth. Bringing such an innovation to light provides an advancement of our arts, interests, styles, and exchanges between one another. This is why I have been so interested, engaged, and passionate about this space in general. 

It came to my surprise upon joining, I was immediately hooked at the constant source of information this sub provided me. 

This industry/idea I wasn't entirely sure about, but was always genuinely interested was slowly defined for me over time for me through daily scrolls and engagement. It's all done in a great fashion on this sub, generally solid information complimented by well spoken dialogue, debates, facts and articles, and of course the strings of quality jokes. (lol) 

To these likeminded, helpful, and positive team mates, you have my eternal appreciation. It has been a honor to share the same timeline with such selfless individuals.

Now, I wrote all this because this will be my last post for who knows how long; minimum two years. This is not random however, I stopped using all social media accounts a decade ago. Unfortunately, I spend a little too much time using this app all together now. Life is a little too hectic and demanding for me to justify my current phone usage.. I just wanted say farewell, with love and sincerity, to you all. Always follow your dreams!

23/2/23,Both game developers and players benefit from blockchain technology,"I believe that decentralization is beneficial for both gamers and game developers, which is why moving to the blockchain seems logical. It is possible for the players to own their characters, weapons, skins, armor and other items in the form of NFTs, which can then be resold in the NFT market.

Game developers can benefit from the added security of the blockchain, as well as the ability to monetize their products more easily. Players will benefit from increased transparency, as well as the ability to build wealth through reselling their virtual assets. Decentralizing gaming is therefore a great way to create a secure and lucrative gaming experience for everyone.

In traditional gaming, third parties control rankings, determine ranking to expectant gamers, and control finances, so blockchain developers don't have to worry about that.

Blockchain technology allows game developers to store and manage rankings, game stats, and other essential information on a decentralized, immutable ledger. This means that developers don't have to rely on third-party entities to manage these aspects of the game, which increases their control and autonomy.

Cartesi is offering developers looking to develop games on the blockchain the opportunity to streamline the process with its Blockchain OS. Through this tool, they will be able to access libraries, stacks, and tools that make developing blockchain games more affordable, more efficient, and more inclusive. LUA code can be ported easily using Cartesi's tools as well. In addition, Cartesi's Blockchain OS is designed to be simple to use and understand, providing developers with an easy way to access blockchain technology."

23/2/23,Realistic expectations of returns and how to avoid potential scams,"When deciding which crypto currencies to invest in it's important to know the market cap and supply. You can find this information on websites like coinmarketcap.

# Market Capitalization 

In order for the coin to 10x in value the market cap will also need to 10x so coins with a lower market cap can have a higher chance of returns although this also shows that there's less people willing to invest their money in that particular coin. So maybe a minimum market cap of 10m could be the limit.

# Supply

Circulating Supply and Max Supply is very important. Some coins don't give this information which means you have no idea how many coins the founders hold. This is how rug pulls usually occur, the founders will sell more coins than exchanges believe exist. Coins with a lower max supply are probably more valuable than those with a higher supply although it depends on the project and use cases. 

# Strategy 

The 3 L's to be aware of ... Liquor, Ladies and Leverage. They can often be the downfall of man. Don't invest when drunk or to impress others and never ... ever use leverage. It's best to diversify your portfolio into the top 10 or 20 coins rather than just 1. See Luna for example."

23/2/23,Origins of Cryptocurrency: The Untold Story of Bit Gold,"Most people don't actually know that BitGold was created in 1998, and the was the first Cryptocurrency. Not Bitcoin. 

So here's a list of facts about Bit Gold you might not know of. 

##1
Development: Bit gold was developed by Nick Szabo, a computer scientist and cryptographer, in the late 1990s. Szabo is also known for coining the term ""smart contracts"" and has been credited with laying the foundations for modern cryptocurrencies.

##2
Concept: The concept of Bit gold was based on using cryptography to create a decentralized digital currency that could be exchanged without the need for a centralized intermediary. It aimed to address some of the flaws in traditional fiat currencies, such as the risk of inflation and the potential for government interference.

##3
Mechanism: Bit gold was designed to work by recording transactions on a decentralized ledger, similar to the blockchain technology used in modern cryptocurrencies. It used a proof-of-work system to validate transactions and prevent fraud, which is also a key feature of Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies.

##4
Unique features: Bit gold had some unique features, such as the use of digital signatures to verify ownership of coins and the inclusion of a timestamp to prevent double-spending. It also allowed users to convert their Bit gold coins into physical gold through a process called ""hashcash postage.""

##5
Limited adoption: Bit gold never gained widespread adoption and was largely overshadowed by the emergence of Bitcoin in 2009. However, its influence can be seen in the development of subsequent cryptocurrencies and the broader concept of decentralized finance.

##6
Legacy: Despite its limited impact, Bit gold is still considered an important milestone in the history of cryptocurrency. It demonstrated the potential for using cryptography to create a decentralized financial system and helped to inspire the development of subsequent cryptocurrencies that have revolutionized the world of finance.

##7
Open-source: Bit gold was open-source, which means that its code was freely available for others to use and modify. This allowed developers to build on top of the existing technology and make improvements or create new applications.

##8
Incomplete implementation: While the concept of Bit gold was revolutionary, the actual implementation was incomplete. Szabo never fully developed the technology or released a fully functional version of the software.

##9
Similarities with Bitcoin: Bit gold shares many similarities with Bitcoin, including the use of proof-of-work to validate transactions and the decentralized ledger system. Bitcoin has been credited with taking the concept of Bit gold to the next level and making it more accessible to the general public.

##10
Inspiration for other cryptocurrencies: Bit gold has inspired the development of other cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based technologies. It laid the groundwork for the development of Ethereum, which introduced the concept of smart contracts and has led to the creation of a whole ecosystem of decentralized applications"

I think that many people especially newbies dont have any idea what will they do when the bull run comes. I nearly lost all my money in the bull run because I didnt have any plans and made so many dumb trades. Another problem is that when the bull run comes even the most dumb projects will skyrocket and you will start to fomo.

I currently hold ADA, ALGO, CRO (what a let down) and of course BTC and ETH. 

I’ve also learned to put these coins into a wallet with all these exchanges failing, and converted coins that were sketchy to BTC or ETH, I don’t want to encounter a LUNA situation. I should have listened to the advice given in this sub about those things.

23/2/23,Circulating Supply vs Max Supply,"Tldr: ELI5 red flags when it comes to circulating supply compared to total/maximum supply

I've been researching a few projects lately and I'm trying to understand some basics when it comes to supply.

I see often that a low circulating supply compared to max supply is seen as a red flag. Why exactly is this? I hear the phrase ""dilution"" thrown around a lot. Is the fear that the project (or its mechanisms) can print x many tokens, introduce them to the market, and crater price?

On the other hand, is a project with a low circulating supply to max supply ""early?"" Meaning, if a token theoretically has a max supply of 4 billion and a circulating supply of 2 million, could this be a green flag instead of a red flag? Signaling that you are an early buyer of what you feel is a promising project or token?

I know this is a little vague and disjointed, so if you got this far thanks for reading. Trying to understand the market a little better than I currently do."

23/2/23,"Next Fed Interest Rate Hike in One Month, March 22","In December the Fed was happy with inflation changes and foresaw a modest 0.25% rate hike at the meeting in March. Things have changed in the past two months and inflation has crept up slightly from December. The economy has not slowed as much as they were hoping and keeps humming along. 

There are now [expectations the Fed will raise interest rates 0.5%-0.75%](Fed policymakers were nearly unanimous about a 25 basis points rate hike just weeks ago. But the inflation picture has become a lot more daunting). If they double or triple the rate hike that they announced this will likely have negative impacts on the financial markets. 

There is a solid chance that we could again see a decrease in institutional money going into crypto and a pull back on some of the crypto gains we have seen lately. Fortunately, crypto does not always follow the stock market. BTC typically has decent movement after the Fed releases their rate hikes, regardless of it being the same movement as the stock market."

23/2/23,Has anyone ever had their Kraken account banned for no reason?,"I got an email today notifying me that my account that I just opened was being shutdown.  I had only made a single transaction on the account for like $20.  They said for “security reasons” they can’t tell me why I’m being banned.  I am completely baffled as to what went wrong here.

What’s most alarming to me is that they froze my assets and shutdown my account with no warning and I have no recourse or explanation as to why.   Like this is worse than traditional banking here.  Has this happened to anyone else?   Is this a common practice that a CEX can ban for no reason and freeze your assets leaving you no recourse as to dispute their decision?   I’ve never experienced anything like this even in traditional banking.   This looks really bad for Kraken.

Edit:  For those wondering I purchased roughly $20 worth of Monero.  As far as I have been able to ascertain that should be perfectly legal to do so where I live.  It was literally the only transaction I made on my account that I opened about 4 days ago.  I got my account shutdown and have been given no explanation and through multiple emails with 2 different customer reps I’ve been told they can’t tell me why.

Has anyone else had this experience with Monero on Kraken?  Is like some shadow ban happening in the US against Monero?  Do any of you hold or transfer Monero in and out of your Kraken account?  Have you experienced any issues?

Edit 2:  I use a VPN but I didn’t set it to appear like I was in a different country than where I reside.  I interact with plenty of apps that allow me to use my VPN.  Heck even my stupid bank allows me to log in with it.  How in the heck does that get me flagged.

If anyone is feeling daring log into your kraken account with a vpn and try to buy a small amount of Monero.  I’m wondering if it is just me.  This is really crappy design if that is all it takes to get your account flagged and taken down."
23/2/23,DeFi Protocol Platypus to Repay at Least 63% of User Funds After $9M Hack,
23/2/23,"Beyond the hype, Layer-2 scaling solutions are here to scale computation and drive innovation.","Ethereum scalability remains a long standing issue and the number of users has also continued to increase putting more strain on the blockchain. The result is high cost of using the network and low throughput. A number of Layer 2 scaling solutions have been developed to improve the speed and the efficiency of the Ethereum blockchain. This is achieved by processing transactions on 3rd party networks instead of the Ethereum mainnet.

These Layer-2 scaling solutions: State channels, Sidechains, Plasma, Validium, Zero-knowledge Rollups, and Optimistic Rollups each having its advantages and disadvantages. Recently, a lot of attention has been on Zero-knowledge Rollups (Zk Rollups) projects such as SYS, LRC, ZKS and ZKP as well as the upcoming Polygon ZkEVM with Optimistic Rollups projects such as OP, Arbitrum and CTSI not too far behind.

I find Cartesi's solution quite interesting even though the project is less popular than the likes of Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism. Cartesi can run an entire Linux OS at the execution layer with a RISC-V-based VM for high-intensity computation and it's chain-agnostic. The combination of an Optimistic Rollups framework and the Cartesi Machine Emulator enables the development of smart contracts and DApps using any package or library that is available for Linux. This means that web2 developers can easily code smart contracts using familiar programming languages like Python, Java, c++ and Rust without the need to learn Solidity.

Even though it's still early in 2023, layer-2s aren't slowing down (Coinbase today announced it's Layer-2 blockchain, Base). Layer-2 scaling solutions are still coming up with new ideas and helping Ethereum grow in new ways, like gaming, AI and Web2 integrations. There should be a few clear winners at the end of the year that will keep doing well for years to come."
23/2/23,"Crypto, Virtual Reality, and the Real Estate Agent","My wife and I bought a condo several years ago. We viewed the property and pics via Zillow, visited the area, looked at the school district, the walkability score, etc. We were 100% positive we would buy it without ever visiting the property itself. However, of course we visited it before actually buying. The real estate agent walked us through the space, we gave him an offer, it was accepted, we got the condo, and the real estate agent walked off with a cool 3% off the top.

Now imagine the not-so-distant future when NFTs take care of the paperwork and offer, and virtual reality contraptions can ""walk"" us through the property. Will it be necessary to have real estate agents? Maybe. Maybe not, but i feel like they definitely wouldn't need a commission that nets them thousands of dollars.

Maybe in the future real estate agents simply become well-paid doormen - people trusted with keys to a property that walk you through the space and make $30/hr - not 3% of the home's value.

Curious what your thoughts are on this. Are real estate agents currently just unnecessary salesmen? Will crypto/nfts in the future replace this profession?"

23/2/23,From Whoppers to Wallets: The Odd Story of Burger King's Cryptocurrency,"##wtf? When?

Whoppercoin was launched by Burger King in Russia in 2017. It was designed as a loyalty program to reward customers for purchasing Whopper burgers at Burger King restaurants in Russia. For every ruble (Russian currency) that a customer spent on a Whopper burger, they would receive one Whoppercoin.

Customers could then use these Whoppercoins to purchase other items on the Burger King menu, such as additional burgers or drinks. Alternatively, they could save up their Whoppercoins and trade them with other customers on the exchange market.

##The launch

At the time of its launch, Whoppercoin was built on the Waves blockchain platform, which allowed for fast and low-cost transactions. Waves also offered a user-friendly interface that made it easy for Burger King customers to manage their Whoppercoins, and it gained a significant amount of attention. 

###The FUD

Because what crypto is a crypto without FUD? 

Burger King was criticized for promoting an unhealthy diet by using a cryptocurrency to encourage people to consume more fast food even though they already used currency to buy fast food.

Today, Whoppercoin is no longer active, and it's unclear whether Burger King has any plans to relaunch it or launch a similar program in other parts of the world."

Most of us have dirty wallets. You very likely have contracts with unlimited token allowance. Legitimate project or not, this is a risk.

[Revoke.cash](https://Revoke.cash) is one of crypto's best security tools. And it's available for free.

Revoke eliminates most of your wallet's attack surface. Please indulge me while I share its best features with you.

[Revoke prevented user's wallet from being drained](https://preview.redd.it/chgpjyrtxtja1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=af6591bc64a3c5a4d32943bcf11ed71a981fbd38)

Protect your money with the following steps:👇

[How do you not notice 1.375ETH missing? ](https://preview.redd.it/h3t7i8uoztja1.png?width=1270&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=41a65f0b8a40b26784d3e4433f79837bda689260)

# CLEAN YOUR DIRTY WALLET

❶ Make note of each network you transact on. Revoke works with most of the major chains.

&#x200B;

❷ Visit [https://revoke.cash](https://t.co/pxVHiQy7hF)

Revoke was released in 2019. It's highly reputable and [Metamask recommends it](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4446106184731-How-to-revoke-smart-contract-allowances-token-approvals) for this purpose.  I've used different token allowance platforms. Revoke is fast, simple, & accurate.

&#x200B;

❸ Connect your wallet and perform an allowance check by toggling between:

* Tokens
* NFTs

Use the drop down menu (*top center*) and check each network you regularly connect to.

&#x200B;

❹ If this is your first allowance check, expect a dirty wallet.

But before you revoke an unrecognized contract:

* Run it on Etherscan. It may be legit and you simply forgot.
* Revoke contracts you don't recall or ID on Etherscan

⚠️ **Revoking a token allowance incurs a Metamask transaction. It's about $1.**

&#x200B;

❺ Bookmark the URL and schedule this task at least once monthly.  You should always know who has access to your crypto.

&#x200B;

# EXTENSION

Download Revoke's extension if you're lazy. That's what I did.  This screen cap shows the extension's primary functions.

[Revoke Extension](https://preview.redd.it/580401d64uja1.png?width=549&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9311e016ca8af68d40b73088d2bc35950cb0675a)

&#x200B;

Revoke's extension appears ahead of Metamask. It offers a transaction detail in plain language. Metamask window appears only after you select **continue**.

https://preview.redd.it/2m7fquvf5uja1.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3e65a9c2f1754e0c2c620eeac2f9e0ad6d40db0b

*BTW, Fire App & Blockfence are excellent security tools themselves. I use them in combination with Revoke. Fire App runs a simulated txn (dry run) and presents the results before you confirm the txn. Never risk your assets. Blockfence uses ChatGPT to examine the contract. It also presents pre-signature results. Please expect a separate Reddit post on those 2 resources tonight.*

&#x200B;

Please make a habit to check your contract allowances at least once monthly. Nobody but you should have unlimited access to your crypto & NFTs.

Best of luck to you.🙏🏻

23/2/23,"Why Powerful People, SEC, FED, IMF, Central Banks and Governments Fear Cryptocurrency","As we all know, cryptocurrencies have not been very loved by people in power and governments this is why I bring you this post to discuss why powerful people and governments fear and hate cryptocurrencies.

# Corruption 💰

Cryptocurrencies area direct threat to established financial institutions and the power structures that support them. Crypto provides a decentralized and trust less alternative to traditional banking and they have the potential to erode the power and influence of established financial institutions and the individuals who benefit from them. This is why crypto is a major threat to the interests of powerful people and organizations who rely on the current system to maintain their wealth and influence.

# Transparency 👻

Also, powerful people and governments generates crypto FUD saying that it is only used for criminal activities which is not totally a lie because there are individuals that use crypto for illegal activities but this also can applied to traditional currencies. The beneficial part of crypto against traditional currencies is that can be tracked and traced through blockchain which means that it is more transparent than traditional currencies.

# Control and power 🔏

Furthermore, governments fear cryptocurrencies because crypto is a challenge to their monopoly on the creation and distribution of currency because it allows individuals to bypass government-controlled currencies. This reduces the power and influence of governments over financial systems and this is a major threat to the power and control that governments have over their citizens.

**My personal final conclusion**

Even if they try with all their power they could only slow down crypto adoption in the short term but I truly believe that crypto is unstoppable and they will have no other choice to adopt it. Regarding all the fear I understand their position because if affects their happy status quo and their corruption ways which they will have to adapt to crypto. In the end, crypto is for the people.

I am happy to be alive to witness this revolution.

A case study on Big Eyes Coin and Analytics Insight.,"# I read a ton of news articles about crypto all the time and i noticed that certain media outlets pump up certain shitcoins. I will use Big Eyes Coin and Analytics Insight as an example but they are far from the only ones who do this.

Lets take a look at the type of article that is written to purely create artifical hype and pump a coin. 

&#x200B;

Mixing in the shitcoin with somewhat legit news about crypto. Here they write articles about BTC and Ethereum price and include their shitcoin to attract more eyeballs:

* Bitcoin Dominates Crypto and Ethereum Back In The Green; Can Big Eyes Coin Reach $50 Million?
* Reality Check for Bitcoin, Ethereum as Big Eyes Coin Bags $28m Presale

&#x200B;

Hint at crazy gains:

* Crypto Stocks With 10X Profit Potential — Big Eyes Coin, Stellar, and Shiba Inu

&#x200B;

Try to associate the shitcoin with bigger and legit projects:

* Bitcoin, Big Eyes Coin, and Cardano: Which Offers the Best Security and Privacy?
* Ethereum, Bitcoin, Big Eyes Coin Rate High As Experts Tip Cryptocurrency To Shine In 2023

&#x200B;

Create Fomo:

* 48hrs Remain Of The Big Eyes Coin Final Bonus While Solana And Dogecoin Show Why They Are Top Tier
* Big Eyes Coin Crosses $28 Million In Presale; Read, Why Floki And Shiba Inu Should Take Note Of It

&#x200B;

Analytics Insight released more than 30 Articles of this type. If you think they did this simply because the like the project and not because they hold a big bag than i have a bridge to sell you.

Do yourself a favor and stay away from these types of media outlets and shitcoins.

23/2/23,There is more to crypto than moonshots and sICk gAInZ,"I'm no saint. I like money. But I'd like to highlight some other benefits of crypto that I feel are often not talked about because of the volatility and exciting price movements. I mean a lot of us are here because we're interested in making money but beyond the financial gains, there are some other compelling reasons to invest in our favourite projects. Here are a few that come to mind:


Empowering the Unbanked: 

Cryptocurrencies have the potential to provide financial services to people who are currently excluded from the traditional banking system. According to the World Bank, around 1.7 billion people worldwide lack access to a bank account. By using cryptocurrencies, they can send and receive money, store value, and access other financial services without relying on a bank or government. This can help reduce poverty and increase economic participation.


Promoting Privacy: 

Several cryptocurrencies offer a high degree of privacy and anonymity in transactions. This can be important for people who want to keep their financial activities hidden from prying eyes, whether it's for personal or political reasons. Cryptocurrencies can also protect against government surveillance and censorship, which is particularly relevant in authoritarian regimes. Even though these coins might not provide financial gains or a good outlook on your investment, you could make a statement by holding or using them.


Encouraging Decentralization: 

One of the key features of cryptocurrencies is that they are decentralized, meaning they don't rely on a central authority to function. This can help promote more equitable and democratic systems by reducing the power of large institutions and individuals. Decentralized cryptocurrencies can also be more resistant to censorship, fraud, and other forms of manipulation.


Supporting Innovation: 

Crypto is still in their early stages, and there is a lot of room for innovation and experimentation. By investing in cryptocurrencies, you can support projects that are working on new and exciting ways to use blockchain technology. This can lead to advances in fields such as finance, healthcare, and supply chain management.

23/2/23,What's going on with OKX's OKB?,"OKB is the coin that the exchange OKX is using, such as BNB for Binance and CRO for cdc etc. *(Disclaimer: I've never used the exchange nor I hold any of their tokens)*

Today I've noticed that on Coingecko, **the coin was ranked #8 by market cap**, surpassing, MATIC, Doge etc., **with a gain of almost 200% over the past year.**

&#x200B;

[Coingecko: OKB's market cap $13B](https://preview.redd.it/7ructsx6kwja1.png?width=1283&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b41a5065102ec14c3c00e758036022bce6cb08fe)

However, on coinmarketcap, OKB is ranked 52, with a way different market cap shown.

&#x200B;

[CMC: OKB's market cap $3B \(Supply: 60M coins\)](https://preview.redd.it/xe3ebvrmkwja1.png?width=1187&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7fbf268e126c696545535adb791501be0d88f541)

The difference is that Coingecko has OKB's circulating supply at 236 million, while CMC has it locked at 60 million. I suppose Coingecko's starts are more accurate.

&#x200B;

[Cmc vs Coingecko listing different data](https://preview.redd.it/8cxag886mwja1.png?width=1285&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=aba97316474546e93c0f2bdec7f58401f75a0ba1)

The weird thing is that when you go back a year in coinmarketcap's database, OKB coin was ranked 72, with the same listed supply.

&#x200B;

[CMC snapshot 20\/02\/2023](https://preview.redd.it/l9unxl20lwja1.png?width=1237&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=285dc6b1ada95255a8506dccf2ceb04cb05ad0ff)

It's been a whole year. **The coin has risen 200%** and cmc just never changed its supply? Which one is the correct one? Also, the fact that the supply keeps changing is weird enough but whatever, centralised exchanges can do whatever they want with their tokens. 

It's sketchy enough that cmc has been biased towards a certain centralised exchange for years now but that's beyond the purpose of this post.

**The fact that OKB has risen so quickly and entered the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap sketches me out honestly.** I still don't trust centralised exchanges and neither should you.

What are your thoughts on this?"

23/2/23,Ethereum 2.0 sharding system is a centralization demon. It incentivizes creating multiple validators for better rewards.,"Part of the wow of Etherium 2.0 is its horizontal scale strategy via shards. It gives it unspeakable speed in processing transactions.

But nothing comes for free, and I am not talking about the crazy complexity of this project that is still spinning... 

The shards system unknowingly incentivizes people to create multiple validators instead of one. One may think that it is a good thing, but then your read:

# [40%+ of Ethereum PoS nodes are controlled by two addresses](https://cointelegraph.com/news/40-ethereum-pos-nodes-are-controlled-by-two-addresses-says-santiment-data)

Of course, it will be the case. Etherume 2.0 is pushing for it. And those two addresses' owners are collecting over 50% of the total system reward. So over time, they will have an even higher stake and reward. 

You can follow my other thread [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4645116/ethereum-pets-in-a-room-game), where I try to calculate the math of it. Meanwhile, I can tell you that based on a [simulation](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/4645158/101178) that I ran, splitting the stake across multiple validators can yield up to 4 times the reward you will get with a single one.

The way that I see it, there are two ways to get out of this mess:

1. I know that Ether devs will hate me for suggesting it, but: Don't use shards.
2. Use an exponential stake evaluation system, as I did in [Confidence Coin](https://confidence-coin.com/). It makes one validator produce a higher reward than a split and empowers decentralization.

&#x200B;

Whether Ethereum will follow my suggestions or not, I hope they will solve this problem."

23/2/23,Why the SEC might do us a favor,"I might be a little late for this but still wanted to get my thoughts out there.

Kraken got ordered to shut down their staking services after they got sued by the SEC. This may sound bad at first, but heres why i think in the long run its actually positive:

Kraken discontinuing their staking services in the US leaves a lot of customers asking themselves what to do now. They could switch to another CEX, e.g. Coinbase, but since the SEC came after Kraken, we cant rule out that they wont go after Coinbase too.

But what are the other options? Missing out on 4.17% APY on your ETH? Who would want to do that? Not the people who already staked on Kraken.

So where do they go? They move their ETH onchain. Never has it been easier to stake your ETH because of LSDs (Liquid Staking Derivatives e.g. stETH or rETH)

Now let me elaborate why the timing may be so perfect:

One disadvantage of staking was not being able to withdraw your ETH. But exactly this changes in March when withdrawals will probably be enabled. This makes the staking experience even smoother.

Another pleasant side effect of Ethereum is the deflationary supply. The more onchain activity, the more ETH gets burned, which increases the overall staking APY even more. 

But what does this mean for LSDs?

For one, they will most likely secure an even bigger part of the staking marketshare. Meaning more customers, therefore more revenue. 

But even more important in my opinion is, that this will take us one step further down the way of decentralization.

Since ETH staked with a centralized exchange is controlled by them, its harder to establish true decentralization. But because the SEC and Gensler dont want people using CEXs for staking, they move their ETH in self custodial wallets and stake with more decentralized options.

Overall this doesnt look all too bad now, does it? 

Just my thoughts about that topic, feel free to comment your opinion on this, would love to see different views."

23/2/23,Hardware wallets could provide the innovations that make DApps and app-chains a mass adopted success,"One of the biggest challenges facing blockchain is the lack of education around security. Private key and wallet security as it stands today, lacks the ease that is needed to make the next generation of blockchain applications go mainstream.

I had never heard of Ledger Stax, until I heard about it on an interview and it kinda clicked for me that it really isn’t all on protocols to innovate. One of the big items of innovation needed is ease of use for people who don’t want to take responsibility or don’t really comprehend the responsibility of private key management. Not to mention, UI in crypto isn’t particularly good compared to a cell phone. However wallet providers like MetaMask, Keplr or Cosmostation do have a very fair UI. But it’s still technical enough for people, that they may not want to get into Crypto due to the general confusion’s that happen regarding private keys. 

Mobile hot wallets like MetaMask mobile and Keplr mobile and Cosmostation, that are for cellphones are good to help UI, but security and education is a serious problem. Sim swaps happen. I personally know people who have taken screenshots of their private keys before, because they don’t realize that all it takes is for someone to hack your Apple ID, and next thing you know they have access to your crypto all because of a screenshot. 

Hardware wallets are what can take crypto to the next level. This level of adoptions would also add in the necessity for scalability that Cosmos’s app-chain thesis as well as Polkadots Parachains and Avalanches subnets, would be in a perfect position to capitalize in such a hardware wallet. While the wallet, provides the necessary abstractions to make it nearly unnoticeable what chain is actually being used.

Hardware wallets can add the security and UI/UX necessary, to make Crypto DApps and app-chains gain the usability to go mainstream. A hardware wallet that has UI/UX similar to something like an iPhone, is what it really takes. A hardware wallet will have an AppStore. Some of these apps will be Ethereum DApps or other DApps, but scalability will obviously be an issue, and IBC and the app-chain thesis could be a good solution, alongside parachain and subnet DApps.

Take it easy on me, honestly I’ve had my head buried deep in the actual software components of blockchain and have largely ignored the hardware. When I heard about Stax, and saw the concept, it blew my mind. Please chime in and let me know any other crypto hardware components I should look at, I feel like it’s hardwares turn to take us into mass adoption and I want to be ahead of the curve if I can."

23/2/23,Truth about mining helping to stabilize the power grid,"Power grids typically connect multiple power plants to customers across a wide area. To ensure safe and proper operation, the voltage, frequency, and other electrical characteristics of the grid must be maintained within specific ranges. And this is very tough to achieve.

 If these parameters go out of range, the grid could become unstable, producing effects that impact or damage equipment on the power network. One effect. When the amount of power on the grid exceeds demand, its operating voltage can increase, creating a reverse power effect that can damage power generation equipment in utility power plants.

Challenges of electricity generation are balancing supply and demand in real-time. Electricity supply must match demand at all times, and if there is too much supply or too little demand, it can cause instability in the power grid.

This can usually be solved by shutting down generating stations, but it isn't as easy as it looks to throttle back or shut down the power stations.

There is a potential for Bitcoin mining to help stabilize the power grid, but it depends on the specifics of the situation.

Bitcoin mining can help stabilize the power grid by providing a flexible demand for electricity. Mining operations can be turned on or off quickly, depending on the availability and cost of electricity. When there is excess electricity supply, Bitcoin miners can use it to mine Bitcoin, which can help balance the grid and prevent energy waste.

Furthermore, Bitcoin mining can help make use of energy sources that might otherwise go to waste. For example, some mining operations use energy generated by wind turbines or solar panels that would otherwise be wasted because they cannot be stored.

In Texas for example, wind generators had to be turned off to prevent overload, this could instead have been used to mine BTC, which would profit both the state and the miners.

https://www.khou.com/article/news/verify/verify-wind-generators-turned-off-prevent-texas-power-grid-overload/285-e6a6540d-edd6-40d9-a215-8974397c1ad6

What do you all think about this? should mining be allowed and incentivized to stabilize the power grid?"

23/2/23,BTC/USDT: BTC Volatility Remains Under Control as Wall Street Panics,"• The volatility of BTC has surprised traders by remaining relatively stable over the past few months.

• Indicators of stock market volatility on the other hand have been reaching yearly highs.

• Some analysts think it could be an indication of an upcoming price rally.

• Bitcoin, as with most of crypto, is known for being pretty volatile when compared to traditional investment instruments. Its future is uncertain, and the space is (for the most part) still largely unregulated. Recently however, analysts have been noticing that BTC isn’t following its regular volatility pattern, and some think it could be an indication of an imminent bull market rally.

• What does it mean for BTC?

• BTC has had flat volatility in the face of stock market volatility before, but some experts believe that this time could be different. Economic recovery and lowered inflation rates could result in a return to mainstream crypto adoption, which could cause a recoupling of the volatilities of the two worlds. Not only that, but Bitcoin is about to undergo its fourth halving (an event which halves the rewards for BTC miners) in just over a year’s time. Bitcoin halvings typically result in upward price movements before they occur every four years. Whichever direction it takes, the BTC/USDT pair could be one to watch in the months ahead."

BTC - from my paycheck I use CoinBase’s direct deposit option and have $250 go directly into buying BTC every two weeks. This is a “free” option to purchase, as they don’t charge additional fees. I’ve been doing this since they introduced it as an option a little over 2 years ago. 

BTC - $100 every Wednesday recurring purchase. Just stacking more sats.

BTC - $10 everyday recurring purchase.

LTC - $10 everyday recurring purchase.

DOGE - 1,000 Doge every Friday. 

Then I also use the CB debit card religiously and take XLM as the reward. I’ve been splitting this to stay 1/2 XLM and 1/2 between an APY paying asset (ALGO & ATOM at the moment).

23/2/23,Bitcoin's correlation with the S&P 500 turns negative for the first time since the FTX crash," 

In recent days, the largest traditional securities market index, the S&P 500 (SPX), has stopped positively correlating with Bitcoin (BTC). This situation has arisen for the first time since the FTX exchange crash in November 2022 and for the second time in 14 months. Does this mean that Bitcoin can once again be treated as a hedge against inflation?

 The narrative that Bitcoin is such a hedge gained popularity before inflation became a global problem. It was expected that in a situation of uncontrolled printing of fiat currency, BTC and other major cryptocurrencies would respond with growth or at least maintain their value. This would be indicated by the logic of supply and demand and the guaranteed impossibility of ""printing"" Bitcoin through cryptography.

However, the sharp rise in inflation in most world economies in 2022 coincided with the bearish cryptocurrency market. There are voices that suggest that it was precisely the peaks of national currency inflation not seen in 40 years that led to a deepening decline in cryptocurrencies and other high-risk assets. In the United States, the CPI peak was recorded in June 2022 at 9.1%, while in the European Union in October 2022 at 10.6%. In Poland, the highest values also appeared in October at 17.9%.

High inflation triggered a natural reaction of policy tightening of quantitative easing, liquidity and money supply decline, and interest rate increase. The biggest winner was the US dollar index (DXY), which began its bull market in June 2021. Risky assets, such as stock indices or cryptocurrencies, headed south.

So it seems that Bitcoin did not live up to the hopes placed in it. At the time of the test, it succumbed to the iron rules of financial markets and the slogan ""Cash is king"". However, there is a glimmer of hope for cryptocurrency maximalists. If it turns out that Bitcoin can behave differently than traditional assets (symbolized by the SPX index), lose correlation with them, and go its own way, then perhaps the narrative of hedging against inflation would find its second life.

Negative correlation of Bitcoin and S&P 500 In recent days, an interesting and rare phenomenon has appeared on the Bitcoin and S&P 500 correlation chart. It was noticed by the well-known on-chain analyst   [@WClementeIII](https://twitter.com/WClementeIII), , who wrote that for the first time since the FTX crash, the daily correlation has become negative:  


 https://twitter.com/WClementeIII/status/1628111289045090327?s=20   


Looking more closely at the daily charts of BTC, SPX, and their mutual correlation (blue), we see that for the vast majority of 2022, the assets remained in a strong positive correlation. Excluding the FTX crash in November 2022, the last time the correlation was negative was in December 2021 (orange line).

Furthermore, the FTX crash led to a strong collapse of the cryptocurrency market and a decline in Bitcoin's price (red area). Meanwhile, SPX quotes continued to move up (green area). Therefore, the previous loss of correlation played out to the detriment of BTC.

Is the SPX correction a bullish signal for Bitcoin?   
 

However, the current loss of correlation may lead to the opposite effect. Recently, SPX recorded its first higher peak in many months and broke resistance at 4100 USD. However, after this bullish event, a correction began and a decline to the current level around 4000 USD.   


 The cryptocurrency analyst  [@24KCrypto](https://twitter.com/24KCrypto)   tweeted his price prediction for SPX today. According to him, the index needs to complete a flat correction structure A-B-C with a bottom around 3800 USD. Only after confirming this level, he believes an impulsive uptrend will begin."

This has historically signaled the near-end of a bear market.,"We all know the spot market price we see of Bitcoin, which shows the current price of BTC, but there is actually one way to show an even better price metric. The Realized Price, is the average purchase price of all Bitcoins in circulations. It is calculated by the value of all BTC and their purchase price divided by the circulating supply. Also known as the “average cost basis“, this probably the most important on-chain metric.

Now, we can also distinguish between the Realized Price, meaning the average purchase price, of different buying groups, such as short-term or long-term holders. One pattern that has been evident throughout bitcoins history is that once the short-term holders average purchase price is above the average purchase price of all buying groups, the end of the bear market is nigh…

This is exactly what is happening right now, the short-term holder Realized Price stands at $19.6k and the “normal“ Realized Price is at $19.8k, a cross will very likely happen very soon and thus the end of the bear market has either already happened or is very near.

Bear in mind that this is just one of countless metrics indicating, either already an end to the bear market or very soon one. But as always the perfect set-up can be altered by some black-swan events. So be a bit optimistic right now but do not ignore all possible outcomes just yet."

Many a time, these strangers that offered such deal are using the newbies and their account to do money laundering for their illegal activities. Once the newbies got the fund in their bank accounts, their bank accounts would get frozen. This is because the funds are also usually acquire through illegal means like scam from other victims. Due to this, the funds have to be frozen. By then the stranger buyers have already got the cryptocurrency and might had already sold them to others.

Last few days give me so many thoughts regarding it. It all started with need to purchase something online without need to do it via card or tradition bank transfer for whatever reason I can have for it. For the record I live in the east Europe and we talking about less then fckin $100 in the local currency rate. 

So it would be great if I could just paid with Monero or even any other crypto currency. But obviously that's not an option. So what are my options? Well I thought let's try Paysafe card which can be bought for cash at my local grocery store. So I did. It's time for payment. 
I'm entering the card code at the store. Ups error ""error you are connected to a VPN"" well indeed yes I am. Disconnect VPN try again. Error ""your card has been blocked for security reasons contact support "" whaaaat? So I did...4 days ago. 

My less then $100 is frozen for my own safety of course. There is absolutely no response from the support, I've even tried contact via local call center. The lady on the other side ask for tone of sensitive informations just to tell me that I need to wait for email response...Now the thing is it's all the same with banks or any other centralized payments provider. 

Why people just can't see this? You may believe or not belive in BTC or crypto in general. It's obviously not perfect but for now it's the only real alternative people have."

23/2/23,"Between Biden and Trump, which US presidential administration has benefited crypto more?","Obviously this question only accounts for a smaller portion of the pie since crypto is global and this is just the U.S. specifically.

Back in the earlier years during the Obama administration, the crypto space was generally still small and mostly not understood from a policy standpoint allowing most coins to skirt by unabated by politics.

Nowadays I'm not sure there's anything that isn't political. That especially includes crypto.

But thinking back the last presidencies including the Biden administration, I had a hard time determining which benefits the space as a whole more.

Conservatives generally speaking allow for looser regulation and more tax breaks and free flowing funds for some of the highest earning corporations. Generally speaking I don't think the voter base is as pro crypto as the left, but the actual effect of the Trump presidency allowed more money to flow into the space while generally not changing legality.

This is interesting because in a completely different way the Biden Admin has also benefited the space through massive cash infusions to the general public during COVID, which many people utilized for riskier assets even if they were also tightening the corporate side and attempting to regulate the space tighter as it's grown (which in of itself some people see as a good and a bad thing.)

An argument could obviously be made for either and obviously Trump and Biden as figureheads aren't the sole power in the executive branch. It's still difficult for me to decide which has done ""better"" for the space overall.

Edit: what have I done 😬

P.S. should crypto even be regulated at all by governments? I think light regulation would be preferred, but the amount of old people that don't understand the space should NOT be enacting policy around it."

The Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin in the BUSD/DAI trading pair depegged  from the US dollar and briefly dropped to $0.2 USD. According to Binance trading history, the depeg occurred around 11:00 UTC 22/02/23. Only one sell order worth $647,000 could have caused such a significant downturn.

However, BUSD has already returned to its normal level. The total volume of sell orders at the $0.3 USD level is $3.5 million USD. It is unknown who was able to sell BUSD at nearly $650,000 USD. The cryptocurrency community speculates that the order was filled due to a potential calculation error.

BUSD Issues BUSD has been experiencing problems for weeks, not just due to market conditions. In mid-February, the American company Paxos suspended the issuance of BUSD due to claims from the financial regulator of the state of New York. Earlier, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accused Paxos of violating investor protection laws. According to media reports, the SEC's main claim against Paxos is related to BUSD. The Wall Street Journal reports that the US exchange regulator considers Binance cryptocurrency to be an unregistered security.

Nansen noted that 90% of BUSD, with a market capitalization of over $12 billion USD, is on Binance. Therefore, the cryptocurrency exchange could suffer in the event of a panic sell-off of the stablecoin. It is known that about 94% of tokens are held in just four wallets.

The holders have enough arguments why it will be more valueable over time because of basic economic theories. While critics have there own tulip comparisson theories.

While everyone is discussing if a one million dollar Bitcoin will be feassible one day. **The primary assumption/thinking error (for most) is that economic circumstances won't change.** After the news of the burning banks and collapsed currency in Lebanon. It really struck me. Bitcoin has become one of the if not the most valuable assets in the country without a change in global sentiment. We are still 70% away from ATH, just chilling at a possible bearmarket bottom in dollars. But in this little country a Bitcoin Holder is wealthier then ever.

Bitcoin doesnt have to win by appreciating in price in normal market conditions, it will simply win with the collapse of a FIAT currency. In other words: **Bitcoin will win by simply not losing.**

People love to fantasize about what needs to happen for Bitcoin to become more valueable then it already is, like mass-adoption or another country embrassing it as legal tender. But very little people think about what Bitcoin mustn't do. Which is failing. **If it doesn't fail**, **the cause effect sooner or later will be an astronomical rise in value.**

Bitcoin's succes and therefore it's price rise will be a result of a failing a system. This makes arguing about today's price, and where it will go under what cicrcumstances so stupid.

TLDR; I just realized that if Bitcoin simply doesn't fail, a rise in value is inevitable. Fiat failing in the long or short term will be the cause-effect of exponential value growth. Not mass adoption or an ETF acceptance or the next halving."

23/2/23,CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act Bill and its implication (hopium?) for Bitcoin,"Minnesota Congressman Tom Emmer announced on Twitter that he and a few others are going to introduce a bill that would in his words aim to do the following three things:

1. Prohibit the Fed from issuing a CBDC directly to anyone. 
2. Bar the Fed from using a CBDC to implement monetary policy and control the economy. 
3. Require the Fed's CBDC projects to be transparent to Congress and the American people.

The discussion and trajectory around this bill is going to be a historic event for our financial and political infrastructure not just in the US but across the world for decades to come. Expressing the importance for privacy, he states that ""any digital version of the dollar must uphold our American values of privacy, individual sovereignty, and free market competitiveness. Anything less opens the door to the development of a dangerous surveillance tool.""

From the view I have of the US government, I would be very surprised and thrilled if any version of this bill passes let alone in its current form. Many powerful governments around the world including UK, India and China have already started piloting their in-house CBDCs and are on path for rampant scaling.

CBDCs could potentially be the strongest tool any government has EVER had at its disposal in the history of humanity and this will have shattering implications for all aspects of our lives. The current state of the financial infrastructure is already such that every transaction of ours is monitored in the name of anti-money laundering and tax evasion laws. Should we let them look at all of what we do with our money just because some people out there could be laundering money, evading taxes or performing some illicit activities? Those involved in such activities are already a step ahead and this is also why these people have embraced bitcoin earlier than other segments of population. Despite their illegitimate reasons, the 3 key features for which these shady guys have embraced bitcoin way ahead of the general population are noteworthy - transactions without a central authority/intermediary, decentralization based on cryptographic proof instead of trust and non-kyc/anonymous wallets that preserve privacy.

Governments and private banking institutions have already been monitoring our financial lives and all other aspects that associate with it for almost half a century now and have a dataset whose richness and usefulness has been improving dramatically with the advancement of web and technology over the last few years. I'm scared about the possibility of how much this is likely going to improve over the next decade. Unless we actively choose to not be a part of this system and make efforts to tackle and discourage the existing financial and web infrastructure centered around monitoring, our privacy is going to be lost forever.

CBDCs would be the last nail in the coffin that we should anyhow avoid and the most prominent way we can do this is by adopting bitcoin not just for the big gains but for the values it embraces with a privatised and predetermined monetary policy that is neutral in its intent by code for a cherry on top. Not just monitoring, it is really important that we disempower the government for controlling the value (money) that we spend all our lives to create. They print it out of thin air and devalue it even with other means at their whims to suit their budget and economic interests. We are in a debt bubble whose existence is primarily only because of the nature of money in its current form. Governments have debt that are multiples of their nation's GDP and corporations largely function on and expand with debt while I'm not able to loan out a year equivalent of my earnings while all of our money is lend out to them atleast 4 times over. How and why are we okay with this? Prices keep rising because of the current monetary, debt and growth environment and we have to keep working harder just so we can sustain our standard of living? Real median income of middle class households have been on a decline while the average per capita has been growing. To me, that is nowhere close to an ideal economic, social and political state and far on the other end of the spectrum. We're doing poorly on all these fronts.

Bitcoin is truly the revolution we need because it disempowers monetary shenanigans, debt growth and government control. We employ the government (atleast in a democracy) and need to keep them out of our business and ask them to focus on what we as a society want them to do.

Governments have enough money from the taxes they collect, money they print and other magic monetary and fiscal tools they have at their disposal. At the very least, we need to cut out the monitoring for which they have no good reason other than to empower themselves and have us as slaves to their intent. Bitcoin gives us a chance to do this along with a whip on other overreaches that governments have over economic and social structures as well as our personal lives.

I'm writing my thoughts down with the hope that we as a community can initiate a serious discussion around the bill tabled, overreaches of the government and the importance of bitcoin so that it's not just the Congress whose intent controls the narrative. Or atleast so that we're clear of the differences and know the areas we need to work on to get the government to do what we expect of them.

Governments have already succeeded so far in their fight against bitcoin especially with the way they've got Centralized exchanges to dominate the ecosystem and comply with anti-money laundering laws. I've got thoughts about this I'd like to discuss which I'm keeping for another post so that this one doesn't end up being a soup. Hoping to create a series of posts discussing the developments from the bill tabled and other thoughts I have about the relevant issues.

I really hope bitcoin comes out on the winning side a few years/decade down the line and that would only happen if all of us already involved with crypto take up a discussion and talk about the merits with our friends and family. As much as this sub discourages crypto talk in real life, that is the only way we can move foward. Bitcoin is in such a speculative phase that most of its merits are overshadowed in the social narrative by its volatility and hopes for gains/get rich quick scheme. I think all of us need to take responsibility to change that narrative and make efforts to talk about other aspects of bitcoin  with friends and family as much as that comes with the shame/guilt of being deep in the red.

23/2/23,Opinion: The Invasion of Ukraine and the Threat of Central Banks,"The world is currently experiencing a dangerous situation with the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, and the threat of a potential Nuclear war looms. However, this situation is not just about political tensions and military strategy; it also involves the role of central banks, global multinational corporations and the rise of alternative currencies like Bitcoin.  It is no secret that central banks have played a significant role in shaping the global economy, their existence has even been linked to the occurrence of World Wars. 

Many people are starting to see the current financial system as flawed. The availability of public blockchain technology poses a threat that could make them redundant virtually overnight. Financial institutions make money by lending it. Governments borrow more money for war than anything else. Financial institutions make money by lending money, and they make more money from wars than anything else. 

No other government has been placed under a larger sanctions package than Russia. Despite these sanctions, the Russian economy has grown. Not only has the Russian economy grown; they're now selling oil for Rubles, and have created a gold-backed Ruble; the once-failed aspirations of Sadam and Gaddafi. This was made possible after Putin publicly claimed that he was exploring the possibility of selling Russian oil for Bitcoin. Could oil and gold-backed Rubles deter nation-states from following the likes of El Salvador, Japan, Germany, Malta, and others in making Bitcoin legal provisions and legitimacy? Would adding gold-backed rubles to their reserves, be a more attractive alternative to hedging dollars with Bitcoin? Private financial multinationals have offices across multiple jurisdictions that can circumvent government sanctions indirectly for Russian interests.

Based on Russia's own economic interests, the primary objective of Russia's invasion of Ukraine is to make Ukraine's admission into Europe/Nato as expensive as possible. In a similar vein to what Nato did to the Societ Union. He can achieve this by destroying its industrial and agricultural assets. Ukraine poses a significant threat to Russia's monopoly on natural gas reserves in the European continent. If Ukraine joins the EU and the EU funds the extraction of their gas, this would destroy Putin's monopoly on it. Additionally, Ukraine competes with Russia on many other major global products, like wheat for example, which would be a huge boon to the EU if Ukraine joined its free trade zone and single market.   

Russia lacks ports with access to international waterways all year round, as its northern sea border is frozen over for most of the year. This is the main reason why they annexed/invaded Crimea in 2014 and built a naval port in Syria. They now control East Ukraine and a land bridge from Russia to the port of Crimea in Ukraine. Giving mainland Russia and the Russian Navy vital access to international waterways all year round.  

When we look at their weapons industry; in contrast to the West, Russia and even China have used their military spending (less than 1/10 of what the US spends per year) on state-of-the-art, a-symmetrical technology like hypersonic missiles and SAM systems. Russia has been leading space and rocketry technology since the Space Shuttle was decommissioned; NASA has been paying Roscosmos to do ISS missions for them for over a decade. Russia used this funding to increase its technical knowledge and has since achieved several publicly documented pioneering technologies, demonstrating a capacity to fire MIRVs over longer distances than previously stated, the ability to take out orbiting satellites, and their proliferation of SAM systems.  

The invasion of Ukraine is extremely expensive, both for Putin and the rest of the world, global inflation is skyrocketing. Governments are taking out huge loans to provide military aid, and Ukraine is getting destroyed. The situation in Ukraine is complex, and it involves political tensions, military strategy, and the role of lending institutions. As we move forward, we must be aware of the potential impact of financial institutions and their fear of alternative currencies, places on global politics and economics. The invasion of Ukraine is just one example of the dangerous consequences that can result from the intersection of these issues."

I wanted to know, since bitcoin generally trends upward over time, do the transactions also decrease in number of satoshis cost per transaction on average? Say for example, bitcoin rises more than 10k this year. The sats have increased in value relative to the US dollar. Will the same number of satoshis be required for a transaction as that transaction would have previously cost when it was 10k cheaper? Or does the number of satoshis used in a transaction decrease with the increasing cost of bitcoin? Today, my transaction cost is about 2000 sats for a medium-priority transaction. At the end of this year, if bitcoin goes up, will that same medium-priority transaction require the same number of sats or less?"

23/2/23,Source of Wealth declaration - Clarity and Transparency,"Thought I'd document my case for clarity and transparency for anyone else in the same boat, as I am reading more and more people are becoming confused about this matter and the request.

Have ALWAYS complied with any AML/KYC and as much a pain as it is its just something that has to be done. As someone who deals with AML in part of the employment in I am well aware of the requirements for companies.

In January 2022 I was asked for ''Source of wealth'' declaration, for which I was successful, happy days.

Fast forward to last month and I had a pop up on my finance account asking, once again, for source of Wealth declaration. I'm not quite sure why the source of wealth has to be so frequent in all honesty.

Anyways.... I sent in my latest payslip, P60 earnings, dividend earnings and bank statement showing that dividend (which ironically also shows my tax paid to HMRC aswell, have always been compliant with HMRC as again my job involves direct dealings)

I submitted my documents and it took around 14 days (the completion deadline estimation had passed so I went on support and asked if this could be chased) 2 days later I have been contacted saying it has been rejected.

Now the rejection said my estimated net worth didn't correspond with documents supplied. this confuses me. How does one decipher if your net worth match your payslip/P60. If someone earns £30k a year and they put there net worth as £300k, how does one not know that someone had been saving for 20/25 years? If you don't save and spend every penny your net worth could be £0? if you save every penny of that £30k a year over 20 years your net worth could be £600,000. Im confused as to how they are ascertaining their workings/calculations.

I am drafting out an actual details letter which has details of ALL my income streams, basically salary and occasional dividend.

I have itemised my net worth, including current investments (which we all know fluctuate massively in this market) even including my property (less mortgage balance) which I did forget about last time in all honesty. I cannot be more accurate with the information I have provided.

Im actually going to attach more documentation than requested, including payslip, P60, bank statements and my official HMRC self assessment tax calculation along with official HMRC confirmation.

I honestly struggle to see anyway or anyhow to be more accurate with the information I am about to supply and the documents attached.

I wanted to document this so that anyone in the same boat as myself (and you will be aware of the undue stress and hassle this involves) for peace of mind and to provide clarity and transparency to all.

Once I submit my documentation later today or tomorrow (when I have time as working takes up my time) I will update this post to any response from Binance. I will post any positive outcome/response aswell as any negative. I find too often people don't come back to a post to say if  the issue was resolved/successful, and I will always give credit when credit is due.

While there are certainly women who are involved in crypto, it seems like there's a significant gender imbalance. I'm curious - how can we encourage more women to get involved in crypto trading?

I believe that diversity in any industry is crucial for innovation and progress. We need more perspectives and voices at the table, and that includes women. So, what steps can we take to make crypto trading more accessible and welcoming for women?

Some ideas that come to mind include mentorship programs, educational resources specifically targeted towards women, and creating more opportunities for women to network and connect with others in the industry.

I think it's cool to have this partnership because the Mastercard-Immersve partnership uses decentralized protocols to settle real-time cryptocurrency transactions on outlets accepting Mastercard payments online and users will be able to use their existing Web3 wallets to make direct crypto payments without relying on a third party for collateral.

23/2/23,What do you think of the rumor that SEC may ban staking for retail users?,"Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has responded to rumors that the US Securities and Exchange Commission may prohibit retail investors from staking cryptocurrency.  


[This article](https://aibc.world/news/coinbase-ceo-cites-rumours-the-sec-may-ban-staking-for-retail-users/) shared Brian's tweet from Wednesday “I hope that’s not the case as I believe it would be a terrible path for the U.S. if that were allowed to happen,.”  


The SEC’s Gary Gensler has previously said that cryptocurrencies that allow staking could be classified as securities based on the Howey test. However, the SEC is at odds with its sister regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which has designated ether as a commodity.  


A large number of funds are staked. The value of said funds was around $42 billion in Q4 2022, with annualized rewards amounting to $3 billion, according to a report from non-custodial service provider Staked.  


What do you think will happen in the end?"

23/2/23,SEC’s controversial ruling against Kraken provokes strong pushback,"Last week, the SEC's great shock ruling against Kraken's staking services sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency sector, raising concerns about the regulator's potentially malicious intentions toward the industry.  


As most of you are already informed, the SEC charged Kraken exchange with an unregistered offer and sale of securities for its staking-as-a-service product. The ruling received scornful criticism and resistance from cryptocurrency firms and within the regulatory body itself. The internal dissent raises questions about the regulator’s integrity and intentions.  


According to [this article](https://aibc.world/news/report-secs-controversial-ruling-against-kraken-provokes-strong-pushback/), the worst aspect of the SEC’s decision against Kraken is that the “solution to a registration violation is to shut down entirely a program that has served people well.” She added that the offerings won’t be available in the United States and that the exchange would be forced to agree to never offer staking services in the country again, with or without registration.  


What do you expect from all of this, what's next to happen?"

The Wam game is currently the only link between Binance and me. I heard about the WAM 3.0 upgrade a few days ago, which is unquestionably shaking up the decentralized gaming sector and establishing a new benchmark for what a Web3 gaming platform should be.  


Finally, I want to talk to you about Binance Coin, which, based on some metrics I found a few days ago, might be one of the best cryptocurrency investments right now. What do you think?  


BNB has experienced an upward swing in Q1, which has grown from $245 at the start of the year to $312.52. However, this isn’t enough reason to think it’s a great investment option."
23/2/23,"Make Easy Money, Is Copy Trade Really As Divine As You Think?","READ MORE [https://news.coincu.com/168949-copy-trade-really-as-divine-as-you-think/](https://news.coincu.com/168949-copy-trade-really-as-divine-as-you-think/)

Copy trade is a popular trend in the cryptocurrency market, where traders can mimic the trades of successful investors in order to make profits.

It is often promoted as a simple and low-risk way to invest in cryptocurrency, but it may not be as effective as it seems.

Copy trade relies on the assumption that successful traders will continue to make profitable trades, but this is not always the case. Even experienced traders can make mistakes or suffer losses.

Copy trade platforms often charge fees for their services, which can eat into any profits made through copying trades. Copy trading can also be risky for the original trader, as they may feel pressure to make profitable trades in order to maintain their reputation and attract more followers.

The article suggests that while copy trade can be a useful tool for beginner investors, it should not be relied on as the sole strategy for investing in cryptocurrency."

They also reiterate that the exchange does not engage in any financial management, DeFi mining, staking loans, or futures leverages business on other platforms or with any third-party agencies.

23/2/23,7 tips to help better evaluate cryptocurrency projects:,"**7 tips to help better evaluate cryptocurrency projects:**

&#x200B;

**1) Management Assessment:** 

* A strong management team with a track record of success is important. Does the CEO have a history of successfully leading companies & driving growth? Evaluating the CEO's leadership style and decision-making could impact the company's future success.

2**) Investor Analysis:** 

* The level of investor sponsorship provides insights into sentiment and confidence in the project's future. Look for which hold and how much they hold

3**) Strength Assessment:** 

* Identify the company's strengths to assess its potential for long-term success. Evaluate its potential, ecosystem or factors that set it apart from competitors. Evaluate growth prospects & catalysts to drive future growth.

4**) Growth Potential:** 

* Assessing how they plan to scale its operations is critical in evaluating growth potential. 

5**) Stability Assessment:** 

* Review the financial statements to assess financial position & long-term stability.

6**) Peer Assessment:**

23/2/23,Hope after the Chaos in Centralized exchanges,"Recent CEX breaches and liquidations, which resulted in money losses and damaged investor confidence in the cryptocurrency market, have been the subject of much discussion. 
As a trader, I typically use MEXC because of their track record of no hack history and low fees on their platform. They have gone further to affirm that trust by publishing the Proof of reserve of their platform, which I think will encourage a lot of investors and hope bridging the gap. The most popular being the crash of FTX, which caused lots of loss. In response to this clarion call, there is a need for CEX to show their Proof of reserve to bring back the confidence of investors, which I think most CEX will do and MEXC is already leading the queue."
23/2/23,Amulet protocol continues to expand in Defi space and covers financial risks,"Over the past few months, Amulet Protocol has partnered with many Defi projects and started offering smart contract risk coverage. Partners now include Hubble Protocol, Kamino Finance, and Orca.

>Kamino Finance listing news: [Announcement](https://amulet.org/blog/amulet-lists-kamino-finance/)  
Hubble protocol listing news: [Announcement](https://amulet.org/blog/amulet-lists-hubble-on-mainnet/)

**But what's next?**  
The project team recently released a roadmap for 2023. In this roadmap, we can see many interesting changes. For example, the introduction of multi-chain technology. This will make the security of the Defi sphere available to many consumers. But the main blockchain will remain Solana, which the project team continues to support.

>Roadmap release for 2023: [Announcement](https://amulet.org/blog/introducing-amulets-2023-roadmap/)

**What else besides covering financial risks?**  
The amulet protocol is not only a cover for the defi sector, but also a profitable SOL staking. With the aUWT wrapped token, everyone can earn passive income with a high APY. High APY liquidity pools are also available. There are 9 pools available, including Hubble Protocol, Kamino Finance and Orca.

**What is known about the Amulet Protocol project?**  
Amulet Protocol (""**Amulet**"") is a decentralized risk protection protocol (""**RPP**"") built for Rust-based ecosystems, starting with the Solana blockchain. Amulet has designed an innovative and open risk protection model which not only effectively addresses the common challenges of existing decentralized RPPs, but also creates a new paradigm shift for the whole risk protection sector.

Amulet's vision is to offer **Simple, Reliable Cover for everyone in Web3**. With the addition of Amulet, users in the entire Rust-based ecosystem will gain access to a new way to hedge various risks with cover product offerings.

**Where can I get answers to questions about the project?**  
If you are a beginner and do not know anything about the amulet protocol, you can get more information on the project website or come to the discord. The project team is almost always online and will answer all your questions.

Myself and my friend have spent the last year developing our web-based location finding play-to-earn crypto game in the evenings called Proofoftreasure. 

As hobbyist Devs we wanted to have a play around with some crypto smart contract coding, but also thought it could be a way for the game to fund itself and further development.

Would love to know your guys thoughts on P2E gaming. I know there's big ones like axie etc, but seems to me like the coins are either way overvalued, or worth nothing? I kinda think itd be best if the coin value would tie in with the value of the game - so for example the devs being able to make the same amount as selling the game would.

Any thoughts?"

23/2/23,Steps to start with to spread bitcoincash in lebanon,"1. Education and Awareness: The first step in promoting Bitcoin Cash  adoption in Lebanon is to educate people about the benefits of  cryptocurrency and how it works. This can be achieved through workshops,  seminars, and online resources. The goal is to ensure that people  understand what Bitcoin Cash is and how it can benefit them.
2. Partner with Local Businesses: Partnering with local businesses is  crucial to the success of any adoption campaign. We can work with  businesses to accept Bitcoin Cash as a form of payment, and offer  incentives to customers who use it. This will help to increase awareness  and encourage people to start using it.
3. Community Outreach: Community outreach is an important aspect of any  adoption campaign. We can engage with communities through meetups,  conferences, and other events. These events will be an opportunity for  people to learn about Bitcoin Cash and to ask questions.
4. Advocate for Regulation: Cryptocurrency regulations can be a  double-edged sword, but well-thought-out regulations can provide  legitimacy to Bitcoin Cash and increase its adoption. Advocating for  clear and fair regulations can help to build trust in Bitcoin Cash and  make it more attractive to people and businesses in Lebanon.
5. Partner with Exchanges: Partnering with cryptocurrency exchanges can  help to increase Bitcoin Cash adoption in Lebanon. We can work with  exchanges to ensure that Bitcoin Cash is listed and available for  trading. This will make it easier for people to acquire Bitcoin Cash and  increase its adoption.
6. Create Educational Resources: Educational resources, such as videos,  tutorials, and guides, can help to make Bitcoin Cash more accessible to  people in Lebanon. We can create resources in both English and Arabic to  ensure that everyone can access the information they need.

Overall, these steps can help to increase Bitcoin Cash adoption in Lebanon and provide people with greater financial freedom and security. By educating people, partnering with businesses, and engaging with communities and government officials, we can help to make Bitcoin Cash a viable alternative to traditional financial systems.

How late into bull run, have Crypto.com introduced reasonable stake rates and card rewards?

23/2/23,Coinbase Hacked - 80k+ gone,"A family member of mine, whom I led to use Coinbase, was hacked yesterday. 80k+ gone. The worst part is how terribly unhelpful Coinbase support has been. The hacker added several new USD bank accounts (not USDC or USDT). Made multiple ACH withdrawals in the middle of the night to these accounts. The transfers are processing, not even expected to clear for several days and Coinbase is unable to even disclose the routing/account numbers the hacker used.

One of the people on support said they might be able to stop the transactions from going through but it might take up to seven days to get a response back from their ‘specialist’ - they have to elevate your case but it could take a week for them to get into it… so the funds aren’t cleared yet, there is a window of a day or two to obtain the necessary information (routing/bank # since this was ACH) which could enable Law Enforcement (which has been contacted as well) to contact the banking institution and flag the accounts… but we’re going to have to wait until Coinbase has time to look into this sometime in the next seven days.

I’m upset about the hack - but I think I’m feeling most let down by the abject lack of support and effort by Coinbase to deal with the issue. Support said they understand the ‘urgency’ and understand there is a limited window here to potentially turn this around, but then we're met with a total apathetic response and vibe. I’ve personally been with CB for about 10 years - and I’ve probably led anywhere from 15 to 20 people in that time to use CB as their exchange - I can’t believe they don’t have a more streamlined process to deal with these scenarios NOR a system in place to prevent hackers from adding new bank accounts and immediately withdrawing funds (USD not crypto). I understand some people want convenience - but it should require lots of steps to activate convenience, default should be difficult and time-delayed.

The funds drawn weren't in crypto - they did mess with buying some BTC using liquid USD on the account (I am not sure why they did this?) but maybe they were unable to send that off exchange - I'm almost certain I had 'enable whitelisting' on this account for my family member so my working theory is they bought BTC but found out they couldn't move it quick. I had no idea someone could add random ACH or WIRE USD accounts and bypass the safety restrictions around 'enable-whitelisting'.

Family member did have 2FA working through DUO which is also a mystery to me - I’m knowledgeable about this stuff, I know the cesspool of hell that 2FA-SMS leads to. I’m trying to also understand how these hackers were able to not only gain access to the CB login (maybe a spoof email??) but then the DUO as well... I’m frankly stunned by that and of course - CB is not helping in this area as well.

A bit of a vent - feeling really let down by CB more than anything. Appreciate if anyone has any tips for steps moving forward.

&#x200B;

Update: 2/23

Spoke today with another customer service rep and exchanged emails - each time you want to add to your 'elevated' case, you need to contact support or reply to an email, there apparently isn't a dedicated specialist, it's a revolving door, constantly re-explaining everything.

Coinbase won't do anything to stop or flag the outgoing ACH transfers which are due to settle tomorrow.  Speaking with our own bank (to try and get some ideas of what is possible)  - they said it is possible for them to flag and hold an incoming ACH transfer for suspected fraud/criminal activity. It requires the institution which initiated the ACH (CB) to contact them and inform them as  such - Coinbase for reasons unbeknownst, will not do this.

They also stated that any transaction in or out out of Coinbase is a digital transaction and is  irrevocable. They don't distinguish between a BTC transaction out of  their network (which cannot be pulled back in any technical manner) and an ACH USD transaction which takes days to settle.

CB won't disclose the routing/account numbers in which the funds were sent. They will only do so when compelled under law enforcement requests. Then again, only at request of LE, will they submit a letter to the recipient institution to stop and hold an ACH that is criminal/fraudulent. Of course the funds will be gone at that point. So it's like you're just waiting for the crime to conclude before you take any preventable action."

23/2/23,Coinbase stopped paying eth2 rewards for 2 months and have been waiting 5 weeks for a resolution,"Pretty much the title + horrid customer support. 

Coinbase didn't pay me rewards for 2 months with no notification. I don't log into my account often and just trusted them which is why I didn't notice. I guess that was a bad decision. I contacted customer support 5 weeks ago because of it. Now I'm getting my rewards but am still missing the two month gap and have an open case for it. 

&#x200B;

It has been 5 weeks since and I have no answer from them. I have called 3 times to see if my case is even being responded to and they tell me it will be a few days, just wait for an email but nothing has happened. Today I called and asked for a manager and after an hour of waiting they just hung up on me. I am not even sure if managers exist. What can I do here?? It is pretty hard to put faith in a company that stopped paying me without notice, won't give me any information and wont let me talk to anyone.

&#x200B;

If anyone has any idea of how to escalate this or how to solve it I am all ears. Thanks!"

If you lock your account or do something that locks the account, you'll have to go through the whole (automatic) verification process even if the lock was clearly an accident or if the account should not have been locked in the first place. Since that is the case, I am curious why they state 48-72 hours to get the account back. There may be a good reason that I am not aware of."

As part of that launch, Coinbase announced “Base,” a chain built on the OP Stack and joining the Superchain ecosystem.

These announcements start the movement from a world where Optimism moves from just OP Mainnet, to something more. In the short term, mainnet will continue as it exists today. In the long term, the Superchain aims to create an ecosystem of aligned chains, united onto a single network, and working towards a future where launching an L2 is as straightforward as deploying a smart contract to Ethereum is today. The Superchain will bring new communities and contributors to the Optimism ecosystem, like we’re seeing with Coinbase.

Development is underway, so if you’re interested in learning more about the Superchain and its progress, the best way to stay up to date is to fill out this form, and feel free to share it with other projects and developers who are interested!

I knew that I would need to hold the coins for a while so I was moving them to another wallet using the app on my phone and when I copied the address to transfer the coins, it did not overwrite the address for my Coinbase exchange account so I sent the coins there by mistake. Well, the wallet supported the coins and the exchange account did not. So I emailed Coinbase support and they replied saying the coins were safe in my account but I could not see them until such time as they support that coin on the exchange.

about six months later, Coinbase support emailed me saying they created this new asset recovery tool that I could use to get my coins back to my wallet! I was very happy since the coin had increased greatly in value! So I clicked the link to the utility and filled in the required info and they displayed my coins and there was a button to send them back to my wallet. When I pushed the button, I got an error message saying I needed more ETH. I bought $20 of ETH and tried again, but it was not enough. Then I looked at the error message again and they wanted 149 ETH coins for their new 5% fee that they had just invented. The fee was more than$240,000 and .I did not have it. I still don’t have it a month later so my coins just sit there because Coinbase demands the fee upfront before the coins are moved.

WTF, Coinbase?!","When I tried to create an account, I recognized that Coinbase forces users to perform the KYC-process (including video identity check via smartphone app) during the very initial account creation process.

I changed my mind, since IMO there is absolutely no reason to ask for the ID at this early step. So, I wanted to delete my account. But to my surprise, this is not possible at all. Instead whenever I log in, I am redirected right to the process step where I am forced to continue the KYC.

It is not possible to skip this step in order to get to the dashboard.

There is no option to cancel the whole account registration and just delete the account.

Moreover, Coinbase is just lying to the user in order to trick them to do the KYC. Here is why:

First lie: Right before the KYC page, it says ""If you cannot verify your identity, you can abort the step und continue to use Coinbase."" => This is simply a lie, since you cannot do anything unless you do KYC!

Second lie: A couple of weeks later, I received an email from Coinbase saying that Coinbase has now verified my account and that I can start using it now including a link to the offical Coinbase url (so, it was from Coinbase and not just a phishing mail). And again, this was also a lie, since they haven't verified anything for me but instead if I log in I am still redirected to the f\*\*\* KYC page.

&#x200B;

Long story, short - How can I delete (not just ""close"" but delete = delete the account and all data, since I have not used it at all) my account WITHOUT doing KYC / sending any documents whatsoever?"

23/2/23,ELON’S NEW PET $OPTIMUS,"**Musk HAS A NEW PET ROBOT**

Yes you heard it right! Elon Musk recently announced his latest innovative creation, Tesla Optimus - his cutting edge business venture leading the way in the explosive AI meta we’re experiencing right now.

&#x200B;

**But what does this have to do with crypto?**

Bang on trend is hot new token $OPTIMUS, turning influential heads in the crypto sector. Just like Floki, Musk’s pet dog, had an unstoppable run to over $3 billion market cap - creating new millionaires within months - it now looks like Optimus is poised to do the same.

We’ve all seen how a few tweets from Elon can send a coin to billions of dollars.

Well, already Musk has been impossible to suppress on his latest and greatest passion project, tweeting regularly about his new pet bot Optimus.

It’s no secret Musk loves crypto, with his work to bring $DOGE to the mainstream, and tweeting regularty about other key crypto players such as $SHIBA and Bitcoin.

It seems, then, like a no-brainer to front-run the future. After all, Musk loves memes, and now he has robots to sell.

Yep: 2 + 2 = 4, with absolute clarity for once!

**AI Made Flesh: OPTIMUS**

In 2021, Musk announced Tesla would design and manufacture a mass- market humanoid robot.

He called it Optimus.

Musk has said that Optimus will be “a fundamental transformation for civilization”, helping create a “future of abundance” — one without poverty “where you can have whatever you want in terms of products and services.”

Acutely aware of the risks presented by carelessly deployed or harmfully exploited AI, in characteristic fashion Musk has wasted no time ensuring Optimus will be the first and dominant mass-market robot serving humanity – and safely.

No Skynet here, friends...

Musk is clear about the purpose of Optimus: it’s here to serve.

His vision is for a versatile, multi-purpose, AI-driven robot that can perform many of the tasks that humans find repetitive, boring, or are simply unsafe for people to carry out.

Previously only the realm of sci-fi movies and books, Musk expects to have Optimus striding among us by 2027.

And all for the modest price tag of $20,000. Thanks to AI, truly: the future is now.

**OPTIMUS is now...**

Musk currently has 130 million followers on Twitter – not to mention he owns this key communications platform – also crypto’s preferred medium.

Twitter will inevitably become a key platform for promoting Optimus, alongside saturation marketing campaigns, soon placing the name – and by association the OPTIMUS token – at the forefront of human consciousness.

The opportunity to front-run a new meta in crypto comes along but rarely.

But when it does, it has always paid dividends to those who are willing to roll the dice and take a gamble or, as in this case, a well educated, savvy guess.

Providing the essential crypto security you demand, the experienced and well-connected team behind Optimus has KYCed and remains active and approachable in the token daily, as it has since launch.

Take a quick look at the stats below, and tell me they don’t cry “opportunity”:

**• Doge market cap - $11,507,690,426**

**• Floki market cap - $833,087,262**

**• Optimus - $3,000,000**

If a potential 300x-plus ROI opportunity doesn’t excite crypto enthusiasts and memecoin lovers, then what will?

With the near-guarantee of Musk tweeting about Optimus more regularly then any other token... what have you got to lose?

$OPTIMUS – Celebrating Musk’s Vision

At OPTIMUS, we share Musk’s vision of a future of abundance for all.

Like our namesake, we plan to harness AI to carry our project forward for the benefit of investors first, and in turn for the crypto space as a whole.

Following a tried and battle-tested strategy for capturing eyes, hearts and minds, our goal is nothing less than placing OPTIMUS at the forefront of the crypto AI revolution, as it explodes exponentially into the onrushing bull run.

Like Optimus, we’re here to serve, and will be striving continually to make your investing lives easier.

However, blockchain technology has the potential to streamline many of these processes in addition to offering more transparent and secure solutions.

We are currently seeing a growing number of use cases of blockchain technology in the real estate industry. For instance, some companies like Republic are using blockchain to create digital land registries, while others like Landshare are using it to tokenize real estate assets and create fractional ownership.

We also see platforms like Owny creating marketplaces for buying and selling real estate assets using cryptocurrency, while others like Closinglock are using blockchain to create more transparent and efficient property management systems.
