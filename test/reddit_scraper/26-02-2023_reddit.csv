25/2/23,Is a bull run even possible with the current economic forecast?,"With the recent news regarding inflation, the FED likely to raise rates more than we expected and more analysts now saying a recession seems to be the only outcome, is a large sustained rally even possible any time in the not-so-distant future?  If so, what would be the possible driving forces behind it?  After the Federal Reserve’s inflation gauge came in much higher than expected, I did what I told myself I would not do and cashed out while still in the green.  I've decided to wait, hoping prices continue to drop and get back in.  I'm sure I'll end up kicking myself in the ass for it within a few days... and I'm sure many of you hope the same.  Everything just looks very bleak.

Edit:  Thank you for all of your answers.  Also curious about your opinions regarding the  predicted influx of Chinese money to the crypto market in June."

Original post:

As you can see, we have an officially new segment of the rainbow chart coloured purple. You can see on the website that there isn’t even an official tag for this section yet and so it is important that we in the community figure out a suitable name for this new development in rainbow chart history!

Please let me know your ideas and perhaps together we have the power to decide on a suitably hilarious tag to leave this brutal bear market’s legacy on the rainbow chart for the benefit of our future!"

24/2/23,Ultimately its the people who sold that won.,"Believe me when I tell you that selling and taking some profits along the way is crucial. 

It's not that I don't believe in Bitcoin, it's just that the HODL for life mentality doesn't apply to every crypto.

Remember that during the next bull run, when everyone is screaming HODL with diamond hands, take some goddamn profits.

I rode Cardano from $0.6 to $2.52, ETH from $1400 to $4200 and now back down to whatever it is now.

Even MOONs were $0.36 at one point in 2021. 

Only BTC was my early investment in 2017 and that I will be holding for years. 

If I'd sold the hype, I'd have made a decent sum. The unrealised gains sometimes make my stomach churn. Sometimes you should be greedy and take profits.

So next time when you see HODL posts in the hot section. SELL!"

25/2/23,Do you add the worth of Moons to your Portfolio?,"The more moons you guys have, the bigger the problem. Moons have a certain worth and if you own about 12k of them, that is about $ 2.000,-. I have 14k moons now and soon they might be the biggest part of my portfolio. Which feels ridiculous. 

Now there are people out there with bigger numbers, some even have 100k Moons which mean's 20k Dollars... In THEORY.

Because we also know that Moons have a notoriously low liquidity and if you sell too many, you basically crash the market. So it's questionable if you could turn your 30, 40k Moons into the equivalent in Dollar. 

So do you guys and maybe girls add Moons to your Portfolio? Or is that just swindling yourself and telling yourself that your portfolio is bigger than it actually is?"
25/2/23,Do you watch your balance everyday?,"I remember when I started I bought BTC, ETH and a couple more cryptos and that was it. But a week later I found coinmarketcap and coingecko, so i created my portfolio thinking so nice to have a place to track the evolution of my portfolio!! Next day of creating it, I entered again to check if it works as intended, the next day I entered to see how was it going and I did the same for more than a year maybe two years.

Then 2022 and all the bad things arrived, somehow seeing the portfolio bleed made me not want to enter and see it. I already know how much BTC, ETH, stables and other cryptos I have so i started to think in those terms, in how much crypto I have and not how much $$ I have. I realized that I'm a long hodler so what's the point on checking your bags everyday? Now I'm entering maybe 2 or 3 times per month to add what I'm buying doing DCA and that's it.

 I feel that it made me more calm not checking the balance everyday, I have several real life frens that do the same everyday so I guess lot of you prob do the same.
Do you enter everyday?"

25/2/23,"Even the most enthusiastic crypto supporter 10 years ago would not believe if we told him that, in the future, you'd see a nation buying weapons with crypto to defend itself from a foreign invader. Yet, here we are.","I think this says so much about how far crypto has come.

It also says so much about what it can do.

Never let anyone argue otherwise: Crypto has already proven, beyond any reasonable doubt, to be a remarkably useful way to send and receive money across the world. As it develops and evolves, it will prove itself useful in even more ways.

There is very little room for error and waste in war, even less so when you are fighting for survival like Ukraine is right now. War demands almost perfect efficiency. **If Ukraine is using Crypto to fight for their very survival, it is because it works, it is reliable and it is useful.**

...it also says something about how early we are. 

It would be a mistake to say we are early to crypto. Ond could argue that most people still don't use it or that in most cases we still need to exchange it for fiat before buying stuff and I get that. However, it is very clear that crypto is no longer just a mean for some dudes to buy weed on the Internet. It is watched over by financial institutions, it is legal tender in some places, it is helping a nation fight off an invasion.

**We are not early. We are on the threshold of mainstream acceptance.** 

It doesn't mean there won't be hard fights ahead with vested interests of legacy financial institutions and governments. I don't know how long it will take until the dust settles, nor what kinds of regulations will be in place, but I'm sure that, having already proved itself, the cat is irrevocably out the bag and crypto is here to stay, even if it never completely does away with TradFi.

So keep researching, learn as much as you can, plan ahead and stick to it.

As a parting message: Support Ukraine. Fuck tyranny."
25/2/23,Back in 2017 The World Economic Forum themselves said that Bitcoin would consume more power than the whole world by 2020. We are in 2023 and the complete opposite happened.,"Bitcoin has a very long list and history of global organisations, that are often from the governments, spreading news articles and reports to basically “defame“ it you could even say as most of their reports have no source at all or just a very bad sample applied to the reality. One of them has been the World Economic Forum, arguably one of the most shaddy organisations out there.

The WEF tweeted an posted a report in 2017 about the very bad influence Bitcoin could have on the world, their reason is just the cliche: Bitcoin will consume more energy than the whole by 2020.

&#x200B;

[Tweet by WEF, picture from Bitcoin Magazine](https://preview.redd.it/a1xo6rbgceka1.jpg?width=821&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8f58d13551d420811489e557e3c8364e4a3c02fb)

We all and probably even the people associated to Crypto in 2017, know that this is just complete BS on multiple levels and just another lie by the WEF. Now we are in the year 2023 and basically the complete opposite has happened.

&#x200B;

[Picture from Bitcoin Magazine](https://preview.redd.it/gr6bfvfkceka1.jpg?width=1016&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0883f832cbb97fadbe82f5b84ed7029344e2bf84)

Bitcoin mining council has confirmed that at least 59.5% of BTC is being mined by sustainable energy and that is just the data from Q2 2022, today it is likely near 63.8% according to recent estimated. That is a lot more than all countries of the WEF combined probably.

I am not saying that Bitcoins energy usage is perfect, it is far from that but in contrast to all those rich and greedy countries, Bitcoin miners are trying to bring in a change."
25/2/23,Getting into crypto is not too complicated for the average person today. It used to be more difficult. That is great for mass adoption.,"The notion that average people find it hard to get into crypto is more false today than ever before. People argue that mass adoption has been slow because the average person finds it too difficult to get into crypto. Some obstacles to mass adoption include; “average people do not understand how crypto works,” “on/off ramping is confusing and hard,” and “crypto investing is too complicated.” Investing in crypto used to be more difficult but nowadays, for an average non-tech person, getting into crypto is way, way easier.

##”The average person doesn’t understand how crypto works.”

The truth is, most people don’t even understand how their own banking system works, how Paypal or even how stocks work and yet still use and trust those services daily. 

The time learning how crypto works or how to invest in crypto is no more time consuming than learning how to invest in stocks. While topics like mining, and smart contracts do require deeper learning; the average person will probably not need or want to know any these things. 

##”On/off ramping is hard and confusing.”

On/off ramping is easier than before. Obtaining a wallet is just as easy and almost no different than when someone downloads a mobile banking app on their smart phone, and sets up their bank account with a password. In crypto’s case, you just have 1 additional secret phrase to hold on to. Even depositing, withdrawing, and sending crypto in a crypto wallet or on an exchange nowadays is actually very similar to your mobile banking app on your phone.

##”Investing in crypto is complicated.”

Investing is more accessible than ever before. Exchanges have over-simplified the process of investing. You pick your crypto, enter amount to purchase, and then click buy. This process is no different from stock trading or even online shopping. Exchanges even provide instructions and definitions to trading actions as you select your investments to simplify buying. 

Crypto mass adoption is coming and it’s not even a matter of if it’s coming, but more like when. The ease and simplicity in which to get into crypto has increased in less than a decade and it will only keep getting easier. The argument that getting into crypto by the average person is difficult is more of a myth today than ever before. Which is very exciting news for mass adoption. 

TL:DR Investing in crypto has gotten way easier in under just a few years. Any average person capable of using the internet and smart phone can get into crypto. This is great for mass adoption."

25/2/23,The Five People Keeping Bitcoin Alive?,"[The Five People Keeping Bitcoin Alive (Article and Podcast)](https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/the-journal/the-five-people-keeping-bitcoin-alive/5d156987-2868-4308-bc1d-adcb55d22468)

**TLDR**: According to the Wall Street Journal (link above) there is a group of five people called ""The Maintainers"" who are responsible for keeping BTC programming up to date, and basically the network rests on their shoulders.

**EDIT**: the link above includes a podcast which is about 15 minutes long.

**EDIT 2 and 3**: I will highlight some important points below for quicker scanning. For even quicker scanning, pay attention to the Inflation Bug to understand what these five do (highlighted with \*\*\*\*\*)

.

Here is the transcript of the interview:

*This transcript was prepared by a transcription service. This version may not be in its final form and may be updated.*

**Ryan Knutson: If you talk to a cryptocurrency enthusiast, one of the things that they might say is so great about Bitcoin is that it's decentralized. It's not controlled by a government or a company or any single group. But as our colleague Paul Kiernan recently learned, that's not exactly true.**

**Paul Kiernan: Beneath the surface, there is a group of five people currently who have the keys to the software that most of Bitcoin's network uses, who actually do have a lot of influence.**

Ryan Knutson: How well known is it that this group exists?

Paul Kiernan: I don't think it's well known at all. For the kind of general public, yeah, I would say they're totally unknown. Almost everyone I talk to is like, ""What? There's five people?""

**Ryan Knutson: And how important is this group of five people that have these keys?**

**Paul Kiernan: They're critically important to Bitcoin.**

**Ryan Knutson: This group is called the maintainers. They're software developers and they're responsible for keeping Bitcoin alive.**

Paul Kiernan: One of the earlier maintainers once said that, ""Yeah, it's a lot of pressure to have,"" at the time, I think it was like a billion dollar asset, ""resting on your shoulders."" Well, I mean now it's closer to a 500 billion asset, resting to some degree, on the shoulders of these five people.

Ryan Knutson: Welcome to The Journal, our show about money, business, and power. I'm Ryan Knutson. It's Thursday, February 23rd. Coming up on the show, the mysterious coders behind Bitcoin. The first maintainer was the person who created Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi is a pseudonym, and nobody knows who he or she really was, or even if it was a single person.

Paul Kiernan: But Satoshi disappeared from the internet in 2011, I think. Disappeared without a trace, but before they disappeared, they passed control over the software repository to a software engineer named Gavin Andresen.

**Ryan Knutson: Gavin Andresen was an early Bitcoin enthusiast, and he became the second maintainer in charge. And Bitcoin needed someone to do it, because software isn't just code that's written once and never touched again.**

Paul Kiernan: Software is a living, breathing document. It has to be maintained and kept up to date. And Gavin made some important improvements. He brought more people into the development process.

Ryan Knutson: A big change that Gavin made was expanding how many people could access the code behind Bitcoin. He gave the keys to a small number of people who became known as the maintainers. Over the years, though, the group has had a lot of turnover. Right now, there are five of them. And these five people have a lot of power. **They essentially oversee all of Bitcoin's code. They make sure it runs smoothly, remains compatible with the latest version of Windows or iOS, and is free from bugs. And fixing those bugs can be really important.**

**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*Can you tell me the story of what happened with the inflation bug?\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\***

**Paul Kiernan: Yeah. So in September of 2018, someone reported a crash in Bitcoin Core and the developers went in and looked at it and they noticed that there was a bug that if exploited could allow one Bitcoin to basically be spent twice or Bitcoins to be created out of thin air.**

**Ryan Knutson: If people could suddenly create new Bitcoins out of thin air, or spend one coin multiple times, it would've been a disaster.**

**Paul Kiernan: That's like the killer. I mean, the whole reason that Bitcoin has any value is because the supply of it is fixed.**

**Ryan Knutson: The maintainers pushed out a software patch, but they didn't tell the Bitcoin community how bad the problem was. They just said the fix was for something routine.**

**Paul Kiernan: And once enough of the network had upgraded its software, Bitcoin Core came out with a full disclosure of the incident saying, ""So, yeah, actually there was an inflation bug here. The risk is no longer there. We've taken care of it, but we didn't disclose it at the time.""**

Ryan Knutson: That seems like a big decision for such a small group of people to make.

Paul Kiernan: Yeah, I mean, what a number of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency skeptics have said, I'll quote Angela Walsh, who is a law professor. She said that, ""A good rule of thumb is that if one group of people can keep things secret from another group of people, it's not decentralized.""

Ryan Knutson: Maintainers and other developer is often push back on this critique. They say they aren't forcing anyone to use their version of Bitcoin software, even though 99% of Bitcoin does. Being a maintainer is an important job, and it's a hard one.

Paul Kiernan: Talking to different people, or seeing different people speak, you get a different kind of sense of how much pressure they feel. The joke among the maintainers is that nobody really wants this job. It's kind of a thankless job.

Ryan Knutson: And they don't even get paid that much, at least not by tech industry standards. The maintainers aren't employees of Bitcoin. Bitcoin has no employees. So they don't get a salary or benefits. Instead, crypto companies and wealthy investors pay maintainers through grants, usually about 100 to $150,000 per year.

Paul Kiernan: And that's not great by software engineer standards. If you work at Google, you can get over 200,000 or $300,000 often.

Ryan Knutson: Yeah, or more.

Paul Kiernan: Yeah, easily. So I don't think they're living large, and I don't think that most of them are Bitcoin millionaires or billionaires.

**Ryan Knutson: So why do they do this? What's motivating them to work on Bitcoin's code like this?**

**Paul Kiernan: Well, I mean, I don't think it's money, but in the cryptocurrency world, there is an ethos, for a lot of people in crypto, and this goes for developers and entrepreneurs and also investors. It's not just about buying something because you think it's price is going to go up. It's about buying something that you think is going to change the world, getting in on a project that you think is going to revolutionize finance, democratize it, disintermediate banking. There's all these kind of purported objectives in crypto beyond just making money. And from everyone that I've spoken with in this group, I mean they really believe in what they're doing.**

Ryan Knutson: After the break, who are these maintainers? To the average person, the work that the maintainers do can feel mysterious, but in some ways it's very transparent. **If you're free on a Monday afternoon, you can literally watch one of the maintainers code on a Twitch livestream.**

Andrew Chow: All right, let's get started.

Ryan Knutson: I tuned in this past Monday.

Andrew Chow: So today I wanted to take a look at our address book and specifically how-

Ryan Knutson: This is a maintainer named Andrew Chow. I was one of a handful of people who watched him talk as he coded. It kind of reminded me of a college lecture, on a topic I completely did not understand.

Andrew Chow: The way we store metadata about addresses is kind of ad hoc.

Ryan Knutson: Chow doesn't give many interviews, but he'll sometimes answer questions from his Twitch viewers.

Paul Kiernan: At times, there will be a chat to the side of the screen where people can ask questions and be like, ""Whoa, what are you doing?"" And some of the questions are really technical, by people who are obviously working on their own offshoot of the Bitcoin software, but sometimes it's like, ""Whoa, you work on Bitcoin? I had no idea."" And he just kind of sits there typing away and answering people's questions.

Ryan Knutson: Chow livestreams every week, but he doesn't share much about his life. Like a lot of maintainers, he got the job because he was really enthusiastic about Bitcoin. He started tinkering with it when he was in high school. And before he even had a bank account, he set up a website that said, ""I will work for Bitcoin."" But there isn't much more that's publicly known about him. All the maintainers are secretive like this, but Paul managed to talk to a few of them.

Paul Kiernan: I've been poking around in this world for more than a year. I spoke with a couple of them kind of on background, or off the record. Several of them do give interviews. It's usually with crypto native publications or on the website of a crypto exchange, but a couple of them really don't. A couple of them, I don't know what they look like.

**Ryan Knutson: Here's what Paul was able to tell me about the current crop of maintainers. They're a motley crew hailing from all over the world. Andrew Chow graduated from the University of Maryland and appears to be from the US. A second maintainer, Michael Ford, occasionally posts photos on Twitter of his parents' farm in Australia. A third maintainer, Hennadii Stepanov, is a Ukrainian who fled his country last year when the war broke out.**

**Paul Kiernan: And then there's a fourth, named Marco Falke. He has told me that he grew up in Germany, but he's kind of roaming around Europe, and he said he works mostly from a laptop so that he can be mobile and he listens to music when he codes, he told me.**

Ryan Knutson: What kind of music? I'm imagining like Neo from the Matrix or something, grinding it out to heavy metal.

Paul Kiernan: No, it's like electronic.

**Ryan Knutson: The fifth maintainer is a woman named Gloria Zhao. Zhao is the most recent addition to the group. In 2020 Zhao was a senior at the University of California in Berkeley. She was an active member of a club called Blockchain at Berkeley. Back then, she wasn't a maintainer, but she was starting to suggest code for Bitcoin software**. In an interview she did with a fellow student, she talks about how she got into coding for Bitcoin. It gives you a sense of how seriously the maintainers take their work.

Gloria Zhao: I mean, for the past six months-ish, I've been contributing to Bitcoin Core. And I think it's the only meaningful thing I've done in my life. I can't remember what held my life together before six months ago, but, yeah, my whole life is centered around this. Oh, it sounds like I'm in a cult, but it means a lot to me.

Ryan Knutson: I asked Paul, how does a person like Zhao go from a contributor who suggests code, to a maintainer with the power to actually implement changes? When they are trying to add a maintainer, how do they go about doing that? Do they just put up a post on LinkedIn that says like, ""Hey, you want to come manage Bitcoin, this multi-billion dollar cryptocurrency?""

Paul Kiernan: Well, who would put up the post? There's no formal organization here or at least they deny the existence of a formal organization.

Ryan Knutson: When it came to hiring the latest maintainer, Zhao, her name was nominated over a public group chat that included maintainers and other prominent contributors. In Zhao's case, there was some disagreement over her inclusion in the group. Some people wanted there to be a more formalized process for selecting new members. For instance, one person asked why there wasn't a job description. Others said that all that would be too bureaucratic. Paul says the argument in the group chat got pretty heated, but Zhao eventually got the position. A lot of the decisions that the maintainers have to make are done in this very informal way.

Paul Kiernan: There's no manager or organizer behind them who has the authority to tell any one of them, ""Hey, look, the graphical user interface needs more work. You, Andrew, go work on that.""

Ryan Knutson: The ad hoc nature of this work means there's a lot of turnover. Several of the group's members have turned over in the last year and a half. And Marco Falke, the guy who listens to electronic music while he codes, announced this week that he was planning to transition out of the role. This whole operation seems like very informal given how important it is.

Paul Kiernan: Bitcoin aspires to be the future of money, and for that to happen, the network needs to be able to process a lot of transactions. For Bitcoin to replace the Visa or MasterCard network, it would have to be able to process a lot more transactions. And they're going to make policy decisions in the future to make that possible, because right now, as a currency, it's not super easy to use.

Ryan Knutson: And the maintainers, even with their informal practices, are the ones with the power to change it.

Paul Kiernan: And so software development, really for Bitcoin to reach the potential that its biggest believers believe it has, further development of the software is really critical. And if that doesn't happen, then maybe other cryptocurrencies kind of eat away at its market share. Or maybe it just kind of fades.

25/2/23,"An in-depth yet simple guide to help you understand ""Impermanent Loss"" (Moons/ETH) and a few ways you can profit separate from any other rewards","I recently created an [in-depth guide](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1140y3e/the_complete_and_extensive_guide_for_getting_your/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for how to provide liquidity on SushiSwap to take advantage of CCIP-051 which will pay out extra Moons to liquidity providers.

Naturally there were some concerns about Impermanent Loss, the idea of losing money providing liquidity. However the concept isn't fully understood by everyone and doesn't account for how you can actually profit from liquidity if you start with one asset.

\-----------------------------------

This guide will help you understand how you can make or lose money providing liquidity outside of: **trading fees/sushi rewards/CCIP-051 rewards**

**Example A.** Buy into liquidity with ETH and price of Moons go down. **(Impermanent Loss)**

**Example B.** Buy into liquidity with ETH and price of Moons go up. **(Gain extra ETH)**

**Example C.** Buy into liquidity with Moons and price of Moons go down. **(Gain extra Moons)**

**Example D.** Buy into liquidity with Moons and price of Moons go up. **(Impermanent Loss)**

\-----------------------------------

# Part 1: Buying into Liquidity with ETH

For Example, A and B we will look at buying with ETH: If you are buying into liquidity with ETH, you will be selling your ETH and buying Moons. Once you've done this you'll add an equal value of **bought** Moons and ETH in the liquidity pool.

* **Example A.** If the price of Moons go down, your ETH will be sold and you will get even more Moons, this is a form of impermanent loss as the value of your bought Moons are dropping and you are losing even more ETH which gets sold for more Moons. So you are losing money compared to the starting value of your ETH.
* **Example B.** If the price of Moons go up, your Moons will be sold at a profit and you will be getting more ETH compared to what you paid for your moons. You will end up with more starting ETH as the Moons get sold at a higher price and the value of your liquidity increases relative to what you started with.
   * You can think of this as using ETH to buy Moons and then selling the Moons at a higher price through liquidity.

# Part 2: Buying into Liquidity with Moons

This one is essentially the opposite of the first. If you are buying into liquidity with Moons, you are selling your Moons and buying ETH. Once you've done this you'll add an equal value of Moons and **Bought** ETH into the liquidity pool.

* **Example C.** If the price of Moons go down the Eth you recieved from selling Moons, will be used to buy Moons back at a lower price. Doing this will end up in a net increase in the amount of Moons you hold (you end up with more Moons compared to what you started with).
   * You can think of this as selling Moons at a higher price and buying them back at a lower price through liquidity.
* **Example D.** If the price of Moons go up the Moons you put into liquidity will continue to be sold and you will get even more ETH. Because you sold Moons at a lower value, relative to the later increased price of Moons this is another example of impermanent loss - as the total value of your investment dropped since the price of Moons increased after you initially sold them.

\-----------------------------------

**Important:** Because the primary trading pool for Moons is currently SushiSwap with a Moon/ETH pairing. The price of ETH changing doesn't really impact the calculations for impermanent loss above.

* If the price of ETH drops and nothing changes for Moons - the price of Moons will drop.
* If the price of ETH increases and nothing changes for Moons - the price of Moons will increase.

Adding Equal amounts of ETH/Moons into liquidity makes it more complicated to understand impermanent loss as you have to account for more variables. However you can run through some hypotheticals using this impermanent loss [calculator](https://dailydefi.org/tools/impermanent-loss-calculator/).

\-----------------------------------

TLDR:

**If the price of moons drop** \- you could have profited off of liquidity if you sold Moons for ETH and then added the Moons/ETH pair into liquidity.

**If the price of moons go up** you could have profited off of liquidity if you sold ETH to Moons and then added the Moons/ETH pair into liquidity.

Note: By providing liquidity you become eligible for: Sushi Rewards, Trading Fees, and CCIP-051 Rewards\* all of these help decrease the likelihood of a realized loss after accounting for impermanent loss.

Yesterday, I decided to scroll through the toxic subreddit known as r/Bitcoin and saw a photo post of someone using Cash App holding their Bitcoin. Companies like CashApp and PayPal have the ability to freeze your account, and if you're account is frozen their is nothing you can do. I suggest doing research on **Hardware Wallets** such as **Ledger** or **Trezor.** You can even use wallets such as **BitPay, MetaMask, Trust Wallet ect.** 

Remeber

**""NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR WALLET""**

Same can goes with Crypto Exchanges, though you have a better chance with them than you do with PayPal or CashApp. I still suggest you use a preferred wallet. 

Also, never post a photo of how much Crypto you hold. That's a great way of getting scammers, getting hacked or even doxxed.

25/2/23,Is Solana Down? Network TPS Drops To 100. Here's a Breakdown for Everyone,"In the early hours of today, the Solana network began to suffer from degraded network performance. The network's TPS dropped from around 5000tps to just 100tps around the time of writing. You can [check the Solana explorer.](https://explorer.solana.com/)

I peeped into the Solana Discord channel to give you a breakdown of what's going on.

**WHAT REALLY HAPPENED?**

Solana Labs and independent validators are still investigating the root cause. However, the earliest assumption is that the downtime is linked to a recent Solana software upgrade.

The Solana Foundation released Solana 1.14 and encouraged validators to update to it. However, it appears this upgrade featured a bug that engineers didn't discover during testing. Earlier today, majority of validators had upgraded to the new software, and this may have triggered the bug which led to the underperformance.

Just to be clear, the network is not OFFLINE. But it is barely managing to stay online until a fix is found.

**WHAT'S THE WAY FORWARD?**

Validators have proposed that everyone downgrade to the previous version, which worked just fine. This process is already underway, but Solana has over 3000+ validators, explaining the delay. In my opinion, this is a little bit of downside for running a decentralized POS chain.

Another alternative is for validators to restart the network. This appears to be a last resort option and will only be used perhaps if the network eventually goes offline.

I hope this post gives you a breakdown of what's going on, and yeah, SOL price hasn't reacted too negatively to the news. Investors seem to have gotten used to these kinds of things happening on Solana."

25/2/23,Institutions are returning to Bitcoin again.,"Regardless of whether it is decentralized or not, big investors generally have a say in Bitcoin (BTC). One of the important places where the original cryptocurrency is traded, but which is often not talked about much, are Over The Counter (OTC) platforms. On-chain data indicates that there hasn't been this much BTC under the addresses of such platforms for seven months.

Institutions active in cryptocurrencies again.

OTC trading platforms are widely used by wealthy individuals and large institutions. They are burdened with low transaction costs. Tokens sold in such places do not necessarily enter the open market. As a result, sellers do not have to worry about price manipulation.

As analyst James van Straten reports, these companies have not had as many BTC on their balance sheets for seven months. Currently, they hold 5.6 thousand BTC in their wallets. This is almost twice as much as during the slump in the fourth quarter of 2022. The data comes from Glassnode, which owns three of these firms.

[https://twitter.com/jimmyvs24/status/1628086176845377536?s=20](https://twitter.com/jimmyvs24/status/1628086176845377536?s=20)

Van Straten suggests that these are positive developments as they indicate that large institutions are returning to the market, as well as an increase in liquidity. However, Glassnode does not confirm whether the Bitcoins held in these addresses are available for sale or not.

It is possible that institutions bought the tokens, which could mean that they may also be quickly sold. Alternatively, they may be available for sale, and these companies may decide to liquidate them on a regular cryptocurrency exchange. In any case, it suggests that institutions are active in cryptocurrencies again.

Stablecoins being converted back to BTC.

 In a separate analysis, it is reported that traders are converting their stablecoins back into Bitcoin. This trend seems to have started since we hit the bottom in December, according to Glassnode data cited in the report. When we hit the bottom, the volume of sales turned into a volume of purchases almost overnight.

25/2/23,Is Getting Paid Salary in Crypto a Good Idea?,"* Crypto is still not widely accepted to use for bills and expenses
* The value of crypto varies significantly
* Income from crypto may be taxed twice

* The option to be paid in crypto for your work is spreading. You can find a few companies offering the ability to take some, or even all, of your salary in cryptocurrency. But it's the freelance market that really seems to be driving the trend, particularly when it comes to international payments.
On the one hand, it makes some sense. Crypto payments are relatively easy and low cost, especially compared to dealing with foreign banks and international transactions. Plus, there's a level of security and, arguably, anonymity, with crypto that isn't possible with more traditional payments.
But despite its growing prevalence and popularity, crypto is not the same as cash.

For the vast majority of workers, their salary is used to, well, live. You need to pay your rent or mortgage, buy food, and manage your utilities. With a traditional cash salary, this is easy. Everybody takes regular currency.
But that's not the case with crypto. Chances are pretty good your landlord isn't going to take Bitcoin, nor will your utility company. And while some retailers are starting to open up to the idea of crypto as a payment method, getting groceries with your Crypto will likely require jumping through some hoops.
All in all, to actually buy the things you need for your everyday life will require cashing out for your local currency. Depending on the crypto exchange you use, this can add various fees, wait times, and general inconvenience you wouldn't have with a traditional paycheck.

But if the unexpected does happen, and if Ethereum is classed as a security, what do you think that would mean for the wider crypto market?

Naturally I expect huge amounts of volatility - but the key question for me is what would institutional investors do? They have their fat fingers in cryptocurrencies - would they be deterred if crypto is classed as a security?

25/2/23,2000 private keys compromised on Edge mobile wallet,"Most of you are probably thinking, ""What's Edge wallet?"" It was actually my first ever crypto wallet (previously called Airbitz I think) that I used back in 2017. 

I have most of my funds in a hardware wallet, but still kept some crypto on Edge which I hadn't touched since I bought it in December 2018- until yesterday that is. When I opened the app I got a message warning about a major security issue. Here's the [article](https://edge.app/blog/company-news/edge-security-incident-urgent-notice/) where they explain what happened. 

>On Feb 20, 2023, Edge senior staff were made aware of a security incident whereby a user had experienced an unauthorized transaction which swept the full amount of their Bitcoin wallet. All other funds on their Edge account were intact. Since Edge uses individual master private keys for each wallet, we determined that the user’s account was not logged into by an attacker, but that only the private key of their Bitcoin wallet was compromised. After further investigation, we determined that the Edge application contained a vulnerability that would leak private keys.

It goes on to say that only users who used certain functions in the app were effected (0.01% of total private keys), and they estimate that ""low 5 figures in USD"" of users funds went missing as a result of this. No mention as to whether or not these users have been compensated for this breach.

So the majority of user's funds are still there, and thankfully that included mine (I did have a brief panic when my balance didn't load). They say the vulnerability has now been fixed, but I won't be using it anymore that's for sure.

Curious if anyone here has ever used this wallet, or is still using it? If so, you might want to go take a look and consider using an alternative"

When I told them that they said it must have slipped under their radar but this was always their stance as it is risky for customers.  I said I will spend my money how I wish and they cannot tell me what I can and cannot use it on as long as it is not illegal.  They tried to argue it is for my protection.  Like lol, what.

I use MetaMask and Binance for this and have been using this approach for several days.  Each time it costs less $0.15 to transport even large (for me) amounts of ETH.  

1. Choose to withdraw Ethereum from Binance and select the Arbitrum Network (now available).  Your Reddit Wallet in Meta Mask is the target address.  I suggest using copy/paste or your QR code to enter it.  Click to send and handle authorization.  
2. Head to [Orbiter.Finance](https://www.orbiter.finance/) in your browser where you have MetaMask and choose the settings below.  After you choose the amount of ETH and click 'Send', that amount will move from Arbitrum to Arbitrum Nova (Reddit chain) and show up in your Reddit Vault.

For about a year now, the federal funds rate has been increasing at a rapid speed. During this time, many people here have stated that we just need to wait for rate cuts (i.e., a decrease in the federal funds rate) because then crypto will moon. **Historically, however, rate cuts have actually been very bearish as rate cuts were followed by a major crash in the stock market (2000, 2007, 2009) and crypto (2019).**

The three most recents times when the rate cuts happened were, in order: 

1. **November 2000** \- from here the stock market fell \~47% in 23 months (S&P 500) and \~35% in 23 months (Dow Jones Index) - a long bear market
2. **July 2007** \- from here the stock market fell \~57% in 20 months (S&P 500) and \~53% in 21 months (Dow Jones Index) - a long bear market
3. **July 2019** \- from here -after an initial rise- the stock market fell \~28% (S&P 500) and 33% (Dow Jones Index) in 7 months - a shorter bear market

These three periods are visualized in the graph below (shows Dow Jones Index, S&P 500 is the same story). 

* The three periods are highlighted with a black number and a rectangle. 
* Yellow = interest rates
* Green box = moment interest rates is stable (i.e., no increase or decrease)

**What about Bitcoin?** Well Bitcoin typically follows the stock market. The correlation has never been stronger. We have no data on 2000 and 2007, obviously. During 2019 the following happened we saw a -71% crash during that time period. Obviously, COVID happened here too, so that time period has a serious confound.

# To sum up

Historically, a pause of the interest rates is good. However, **the rate cuts everyone is asking for are historically very bearish for the markets. Once the interest rate cuts end, though, the true bull run typically starts.** 

So, **dont let people here convince you that rate cuts = moon.** It is possible, but the opposite might very well happen.

25/2/23,Best website or app for tracking total coin/token performance across different wallets?,"I'm looking for recommendations on a good all in one performance tracking website or mobile app. Bonus if it also does tax calculations. 

I've looked at CoinTracker, and it works well so long as your coins are sitting on an exchange wallet like Coinbase, but there are several major tokens that their platform doesn't accommodate or can't track including Polkadot and Algorand once those items are moved into a cold wallet like Ledger. For instance it allows you to input your public key for Bitcoin, Eth, Sol, or many other prominent ones, across different wallets/exchanges and it accurately tracks them fine, but it doesn't support or recognize Dot and Algo addresses once they are moved onto a cold wallet like Ledger. (I'm sure there are many more). Not sure if Im explaining this well...it's probably hard to follow unless you've actually tried using CoinTracker in the past.

I'd like to have one app that can track total performance of all assets and wallets. Is there one that does this well? It doesn't have to also be a tax app, but that would be ideal. CoinTracker promotes itself as both, but when it doesn't support or recognize many tokens (or requires manual input of transactions as to those tokens) it becomes pretty useless."

25/2/23,Crypto assets tied to $320 million Wormhole hack retrieved by Oasis exploiting own wallet software,
25/2/23,If they will ever ban crypto or cash it won't be the first time when something like this happen in our history. Between 1933 and 1974 owning gold was illegal in the USA.,"5th April 1933 Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed ~~order 66~~ order 6102 forbidding private citizens from owning gold bullion, coins and bars. All citizens were obligated to return all gold with NO compensation under punishment of 10 years of prison or $10k fine (today around $226k, but in reality much more, since  1933 was peak of great depression with 24.9%  unemployment rate). That shameful prohibition was removed by Gerald Ford after 41 years, in 1974.

Stolen gold was used by US government to build Federal Reserve. If you are american big chance your country current economical system is build on gold stolen from your great grandparents. Personally I can't even imagine how sick and greedy monster you have to be to stole lifesavings from the poorest during  Great Depression, when millions lost their whole lifesavings, homes and jobs. But that's exactly what banks and US government did. They kicked someone lying on the ground by taking their last savings. Taking gold let US government build Federal Reserve and increase control over citizens and banks were able to took away even more homes when people were unable to pay their bills or mortages. It was mutually benefitial to both sides. Politicians& Government made a profit, banks made a profit, just average person was fucked...

Many people  in US especially in 1930's, were actually prosecuted and send to prison for hiding their legally earned gold. Courts treated cases like this with no mercy. Additionaly we need to  also remember that back then  gold standard  still was a thing, every  dollar was equal to it's price in gold, so it was more common to have most of your savings in gold. Many people had kilograms or even tens of kilograms of gold in bank deposits or home safes. Attorney from New York,  Frederick Barber Campbell lost savings of his whole life, when  5000 ounces (160kg) of gold were taken away from him by the government. He tried to fight in court, but he barely was able to avoid prison. His gold  was worth $175k back then ($3.65 mln today). If his kids  would be able to keep all that gold till 1974 it would be worth $915k ($5.1 mln today) and  if his grandkids somehow  were able to hold that gold till 2023, they could sell it now for $9.15 mln. He wasn't alone, there were literally hundreds thousands people in simmilar or even worse situations, 1930's were terrible times for everyone. Just imagine being a Jew from  war-torn  europe, seeing your family getting murdered, running away from nazis and arriving to US in  1939 just  to have all you savings in form of gold confiscated by supposedly ""good guys""...

Gold price in 1933 was around $35 per ounce (around $730 in 2023 ), in 1974 after it was legal again $183 per ounce ( around $1020 in 2023), today one ounce of gold cost around $1830. So not only people lost their gold, they lost chance to make long term profits or gave gold in their wills to their kids and grandkids. Some gave up their gold voluntarily, scared of heavy prosecution, some  others lost it, cause they kept savings in banks and had no choice to took it away. Many smart ones that kept gold in homes hide it for decades, cause they new it is key to their financial freedom in long term. Were they doing something illegal? Yes. Was it morally good or bad? Everyone should answer it themselves.

It wasn't only time it happened. Simmilar things happened also in  few other countries, owning gold was banned in Australia between 1959 and 1976 and in UK between 1966 and 1971. In Soviet Union or Eastern Block not only owning gold, but also  owning USD was illegal and prosecuted for whole communist era and punishments were even more severe. For owning dollars you could get accused of treason or being a spy and in worst case scenario received death penalty.


Will something simmilar happen to cash and crypto? History teach us that those that don't learn lessons from it are doomed to repeat it. We live in bad times - covid, war in ukraine, huge inflation, so also great times for banks and governments to take away cash and crypto. Which they try to do already by passing anti crypto laws and making plans of introducing CBDC. People now are already struggling for survival  so are less likely to even fight back. Maybe it won't happen now, but who know what future will bring in 5 or 10 years?"

Boost allocation to DeFi rewards by 5MM, from 15MM to 20MM Algos  
**Measure 1 options:**   
A. Boost DeFi rewards to 20MM Algos  
B. Keep DeFi rewards at 15MM Algos   


**Measure 2:**

**Measure 2 options:**   
A. Allocate the 5MM “Boost from Measure 1 to the Target DeFi Rewards Program.  
B. Do not allocate the 5MM “Boost” from Measure 1 to the Target DeFi Rewards Program

Personally, I am sitting on the fence but not sure increasing DeFi rewards without a proper DeFi infrastructure is the right way forward but what do I know, I am just a degen like the most of you. 

&#x200B;

>Overview  
>  
>24 February 2023 - As announced in Q4/2022, the Algorand Foundation will begin moderating the amount of rewards distributed through the General Governance program, or Governance 1.0, for the purpose of shifting the ALGO distribution to programs that focus on ecosystem growth, such as: the on-going DeFi rewards program, the xGov Program, or Governance 2.0 (which will kick off in Q3) as well as other programs that might come to fruition later in the year.  
>  
>The total amount of rewards for Q2 2023 (GP7) will be 60 MM Algos, of which at least 15MM Algos will be distributed via the currently established DeFi rewards program.  
>  
>We will evaluate the impact of next quarter’s moderation before defining rates for future periods.  
>  
>The community sentiment across various platforms is mostly pro-moderation, agreeing that we should be slowing down ALGO inflation and using these funds for more productive uses. Amongst the community sentiment there is also support for enhanced and more timely disclosure of resource allocation generally, which is underway with the use of disclosed structured selling activities (complete) and more frequent transparency reporting (beginning in Q2 2023).  
>  
>The two measures below are still in draft mode, the wording may still change based on community input.

>  
>It helped move users from more passive holding towards more active participation; and  
>  
>It has attracted users from other ecosystems to our protocol.  
>  
>This measure proposes to boost DeFi rewards by 5MM, from 15MM to 20MM, via re-allocation from General Governance Rewards to DeFi Rewards.

>**Measure 2**  
>  
>*This measure is conditional on Measure 1 passing. Governors must vote on this measure, even if they voted “No” on measure 1.*  
>  
>This measure proposes that the extra 5MM Algos (“Boost”) from Measure 1 be given to DeFi protocols that fit the criteria below, to be used in targeted activities to attract new DeFi users from within and outside the ecosystem. The goal is to give Defi projects more flexibility in how these rewards are structured and distributed among their user base, targeting rapid growth, deeper DEX liquidity, and incentives for users who come to Algorand in the middle of a governance period.  
>  
>Rewards under this program will be distributed to projects at the beginning of each governance period, and the projects must distribute at least 95% of them to their users by the end of the period, with the rest distributed in the following period. Projects that fail to distribute rewards directly to users will be ineligible for subsequent periods, until they’ve distributed all the rewards received under this program.  
>  
>To be eligible to apply to receive ALGO under this program, projects must have high enough TVL comprised of the white-listed assets below. Specifically the TVL of white-listed assets, denominated in ALGO, as counted on March 15, 2023, must be at least 500K Algos. The DeFi Advisory Committee will review applications to ensure the protocol reported TVL is accurate. Approved projects will receive 7500 Algos for each 500K Algos TVL as above, rounded down. Rewards per project are capped at 33% of the total rewards distributed under this program for that period.  
>  
>White-listed assets: ALGO, gALGO, USDC, USDT, STBL2, goBTC, goETH, PLANETS, GARD, OPUL. The Algorand DeFi advisory committee can add to this list from time to time, by unanimous consent.  
>  
>In the event that 5MM Algos are not enough for all the projects, the DeFi committee will distribute ALGO to each protocol based on their weighted contribution of TVL to Algorand DeFi. If the entire 5 million are not needed, any remaining funds will be distributed as regular DeFi governance rewards.  
>  
>See the [Terms of the Program](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WLHD42wME_mOtBd63mhHYeUlDF-pXrtiZeA54X7H5sk/edit?usp=sharing) for the complete set of rules.

25/2/23,"So, when can we expect crypto be usable by the average person ?","I love the power of crypto and it's technology, decentralized web in general is an awesome concept, but in the years i've now been using crypto i realize that every time i need to use something there is a learning curve that is more or less easy, but always there.

&#x200B;

We all talk about crypto going mainstream, but how can we expect the average person, to deal with having assets on different chains, knowing how and where to bridge them , knowing the fees associated with each transactions, knowing the number of confirmations / adding / removing chains etc... i've used crypto to buy hardware second hand with people and as long as we're both on the same chain and want to transfer money, it's pretty easy and straight forward, but then it stops there.

Using defi in general is super unintuitive to the average person that is unfamiliar with crypto i've had friends tell me things such as:  
""why can't i use trustwallet for that ?""  
""\_well trust wallet doesn't support arbitrum nova so\~""  
""so you're telling me i have to setup another new wallet just to use X...""  
""welll yeah""  


Why is crypto still so complicated after so long being there, i love the technology but we can't expect it to go mainstream as long as there is not a simple standard way to interact with all chains, and i'm honestly thinking as long as crypto stays that way, it will always be a niche people thing.

&#x200B;

What are your thoughts on that, i feel like crypto elitists would attack me for saying that, but surely i can't be the only one seeing crypto from that perspective ?"

Our latest project is DCTA’s #StoptheSEC Action Days 2023, aimed at getting cryptocurrency consumers engaged in the national legislative process in order to reign in the SEC. Our goal is to connect consumers with their federal representatives so they can communicate how much the SEC has hurt their investments.

As you all know, the SEC continues to refuse to proactively issue regulatory guidance for the sector and instead prefers to set policy through enforcement actions. This doesn’t help consumers - the SEC’s inaction harms us by not tackling bad actors when it is needed and their overreaction after the fact.

Take 30 seconds out of your day and contact Congress using our free and easy tool at [https://joindcta.org/advocacy/stop-the-sec/](https://joindcta.org/advocacy/stop-the-sec/).

The influx of great news of the Microsoft and Tencent partnerships from ANKR hit a brick wall after ANKR openly admits they do not want the value of the token to go up simply due to hodling. Now public token investors are directly calling out the company on reddit and twitter asking for an official response from the company saying this is either not true or is going to change. In my opinion a lot of people are going to abandon the token if the company just acts like public investors in the token don't matter.

This happened before to other countries such as Iran. Independently where you stand politically, from a pure business point of view this is scary: one country could cut off a whole country from most of the world's money transactions. Even legitimate businesses are affected by this.

Like the point of this isn't to bypass KYC. It is to live the life you want without being forced to put your money in a system you don't trust.

&#x200B;

Anyways, hands down it will be far easier to use a bank account. And many times quicker. But there is ways.

1. Obviously you can do something like earn moons, airdrops, get paid in crypto, etc. And then trade that for crypto. 
2. You can buy crypto with a prepaid gift card. Here is a guide, but note you likely will need to jump through things. Like buying on one exchange, transfer to another exchange with crypto you actually want, swap, and so on. [https://usethebitcoin.com/buy-bitcoin-with-prepaid-card/](https://usethebitcoin.com/buy-bitcoin-with-prepaid-card/) Note this method can cost you more depending on who you use and what not. 
3. Crypto ATM 
4. P2P (trade cash for crypto with someone)

It's been interesting monitoring things in a much more passive way (I was headfirst down the rabbit hole that year). Did you find it easy to accumulate more in the following bear markets, or find yourself not checking your accounts every 3 seconds? I can certainly say for myself that I don't check my accounts in an unhealthy way anymore, but I won't lie and convince myself I still don't have a mild fascination with the market movement and state of adoption. 

The cyclical nature of conversations from doom and gloom to absolute euphoria based on the market has been entertaining (?) in many ways, especially with the rise and fall of so many shitcoins, rug pulls and bad faith developers.

Did the mass attention to the crypto market serve to bolster your faith in the tech/financial possibilities since then? Obviously the FOMO and confirmation bias would have affected tons of folks who have been around for at least 5-6 years, but I'm interested in hearing people who were around at that time's general thoughts and opinions, especially since we've seen extreme fluctuations in the space."

Moons. How do we treat this? I assume it’s the same as airdrops and mining rewards in that we are expected to report  the USD value the day we obtain moons each month. This USD value is then taxed at our individual income tax rate. 

But 2 things seriously affect the real value of Moons. 

1: Lack of liquidity prevents people from selling larger volumes at 1 specific price. So we are taxed at a USD value that isn’t entirely true? Seems like the wrong way to treat this.

2: The 25% rule. We can only sell 25% of what’s in our wallet. So it’s not fair to value the other 75% if it can’t be sold. That portion is in essence worthless. Am I understanding this wrong? We shouldn’t be taxed on something that can’t actually be sold. 

To me, this is a huge overlook by the current tax law. 

What are you all doing with your moons as far as taxes go? I feel I should report it the same as mining rewards but it’s not the same in that you can sell your mining rewards while you can’t sell your moons."

Apart from restructuring debt, regulating cryptocurrencies is another priority area for India, which Georgieva agreed with.

""We have to differentiate between central bank digital currencies that are backed by the state and stable coins, and crypto assets that are privately issued,"" Georgieva said.

""There has to be very strong push for regulation... if regulation fails, if you're slow to do it, then we should not take off the table banning those assets, because they may create financial stability risk.""

Yellen said she had not suggested the ""outright banning of crypto activities, but it was critical to put in place a strong regulatory framework.""

1. **Bitcoin core developers**

There are around 14.5K nodes. These nodes ‘act’ in accordance with the software known as **‘Bitcoin Core’**. The software is written by and controlled by the **‘Bitcoin Core Developers’**. Therefore the nodes act in accordance with what the developers impose.

But who are these developers?

“*In essence, there is no single individual or company that governs the development of the Bitcoin project. Instead,* *individuals or teams across the globe propose or initiate upgrades**, which are subsequently* *peer-reviewed by hundreds of developers* *who are actively working on the Bitcoin project. The outcome of these reviews determines whether the implementations are accepted or rejected.*” 

(source: https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/who-are-bitcoin-cores-developers)

Is this as decentralised as we want it to be? 

If not, is it even possible to make this even more decentralised?

And, as I understand it, there are other software clients in addition to Bitcoin Core, but these clients don’t have the same influence as Bitcoin Core or aren’t as used as much compared to Bitcoin Core.

2. **Mining**

As I understand it, it’s not profitable anymore to mine BTC on yourself. The mining is now done by **‘mining farms’**. The Bitcoin hashrate has become highly centralized, as the following figure shows:

  The numbers are a bit outdated (28th of January), but you get the point.

Is this to be considered a problem? Does this make Bitcoin less decentralised in your point of view?

25/2/23,Will we ever see sub $800 ETH - a short analysis,"In June of last year, there was a huge dip across all DeFi, including ETH. Three Arrows Capital was a massive forced seller of primarily ETH but also other coins like AVAX and SOL

As we know now ... there are some speculations that that dip was fabricated by FTX to liquidate 3AC and some other big players. The dip conveniently stopped just $50 above the massive DeFi liquidation cascade.

[ETH Weekly chart with liquidation levels](https://preview.redd.it/wyby1jsasaka1.png?width=1336&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=01ec13bc27281874fb5fa71eaa94e9ce301863aa)

Many thought that the price would dip down there sometime in the future to ""finish the job"" before finally going up... but it didn't happen.

All those liquidations did not happen and AAVE and MakerDAO survived.

Almost **TWO MILLION ETH** resides at those levels.

[Liquidation levels in DeFI - Source DeFi Llama](https://preview.redd.it/dyg9j8qkqaka1.png?width=1167&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=92d062097c96145ef6b57f7783844a9be201105a)

Liquidity drives the price so these should be kept in mind for the future price action. Should we drop below $1000 I believe $800 will get attacked... 

Do you think these levels will stay protected or we make this juicy dip before we finally start the bull market? Bear in mind... if this thing occurs for whatever reason.. it will likely be a once in a lifetime opportunity :)

https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2023/pr23002.html

Joint Statement on Crypto-Asset Risks to Banking Organizations 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)
(collectively, the agencies) are issuing the following statement on crypto-asset1
 risks to banking 
organizations. 
The events of the past year have been marked by significant volatility and the exposure of 
vulnerabilities in the crypto-asset sector. These events highlight a number of key risks associated 
with crypto-assets and crypto-asset sector participants that banking organizations should be 
aware of, including: 
 
• Risk of fraud and scams among crypto-asset sector participants. 
• Legal uncertainties related to custody practices, redemptions, and ownership rights, some of 
which are currently the subject of legal processes and proceedings. 
• Inaccurate or misleading representations and disclosures by crypto-asset companies, 
including misrepresentations regarding federal deposit insurance, and other practices that 
may be unfair, deceptive, or abusive, contributing to significant harm to retail and 
institutional investors, customers, and counterparties. 
• Significant volatility in crypto-asset markets, the effects of which include potential impacts 
on deposit flows associated with crypto-asset companies. 
• Susceptibility of stablecoins to run risk, creating potential deposit outflows for banking 
organizations that hold stablecoin reserves. 
• Contagion risk within the crypto-asset sector resulting from interconnections among certain 
crypto-asset participants, including through opaque lending, investing, funding, service, and 
operational arrangements. These interconnections may also present concentration risks for 
banking organizations with exposures to the crypto-asset sector. 
• Risk management and governance practices in the crypto-asset sector exhibiting a lack of 
maturity and robustness. 
• Heightened risks associated with open, public, and/or decentralized networks, or similar 
systems, including, but not limited to, the lack of governance mechanisms establishing 
oversight of the system; the absence of contracts or standards to clearly establish roles, 
responsibilities, and liabilities; and vulnerabilities related to cyber-attacks, outages, lost or 
trapped assets, and illicit finance.
It is important that risks related to the crypto-asset sector that cannot be mitigated or controlled 
do not migrate to the banking system. The agencies are supervising banking organizations that 
may be exposed to risks stemming from the crypto-asset sector and carefully reviewing any 
 
1 By “crypto-asset,” the agencies refer generally to any digital asset implemented using cryptographic techniques.

proposals from banking organizations to engage in activities that involve crypto-assets. Through 
the agencies’ case-by-case approaches to date, the agencies continue to build knowledge, 
expertise, and understanding of the risks crypto-assets may pose to banking organizations, their 
customers, and the broader U.S. financial system. Given the significant risks highlighted by 
recent failures of several large crypto-asset companies, the agencies continue to take a careful 
and cautious approach related to current or proposed crypto-asset-related activities and exposures
at each banking organization.
Banking organizations are neither prohibited nor discouraged from providing banking services to
customers of any specific class or type, as permitted by law or regulation. The agencies are 
continuing to assess whether or how current and proposed crypto-asset-related activities by 
banking organizations can be conducted in a manner that adequately addresses safety and 
soundness, consumer protection, legal permissibility, and compliance with applicable laws and 
regulations, including anti-money laundering and illicit finance statutes and rules. Based on the 
agencies’ current understanding and experience to date, the agencies believe that issuing or 
holding as principal crypto-assets that are issued, stored, or transferred on an open, public, and/or 
decentralized network, or similar system is highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound 
banking practices. Further, the agencies have significant safety and soundness concerns with 
business models that are concentrated in crypto-asset-related activities or have concentrated 
exposures to the crypto-asset sector. 
The agencies will continue to closely monitor crypto-asset-related exposures of banking 
organizations. As warranted, the agencies will issue additional statements related to engagement 
by banking organizations in crypto-asset-related activities. The agencies also will continue to 
engage and collaborate with other relevant authorities, as appropriate, on issues arising from 
activities involving crypto-assets.
Each agency has developed processes2 whereby banking organizations engage in robust 
supervisory discussions regarding proposed and existing crypto-asset-related activities.3 Banking 
organizations should ensure that crypto-asset-related activities can be performed in a safe and 
sound manner, are legally permissible, and comply with applicable laws and regulations,
including those designed to protect consumers (such as fair lending laws and prohibitions against 
unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices). Banking organizations should ensure appropriaterisk management, including board oversight, policies, procedures, risk assessments, controls, 
gates and guardrails, and monitoring, to effectively identify and manage risks

2 See OCC Interpretive Letter 1179 “Chief Counsel’s Interpretation Clarifying: (1) Authority of a Bank to Engage in 
Certain Cryptocurrency Activities; and (2) Authority of the OCC to Charter a National Trust Bank,” (November 18, 
2021); Federal Reserve SR 22-6 / CA 22-6: “Engagement in Crypto-Asset-Related Activities by Federal Reserve-
Supervised Banking Organizations,” (August 16, 2022); and FDIC FIL-16-2022 “Notification and Supervisory 
Feedback Procedures for FDIC-Supervised Institutions Engaging in Crypto-Related Activities,” (April 7, 2022). 3 Entities seeking to become regulated banking organizations will also be expected to adopt and demonstrate 
appropriate risk management processes and controls to mitigate risks associated with planned activities, which 
would include any crypto-asset-related activities, before receiving a charter or otherwise being authorized to 
commence business. The entities should discuss all planned activities with the appropriate regulator prior to filing an 
application.

Currently, the golden key has a 690 ETH offer on Opensea. To which Mongraal has refused to accept it just yet.

If he does, it would make history in the Web 3.0 gaming space.

There's no magic metric but in a pile of thousands of coins, ways of identifying coins worth researching is a help.

Combining Coingecko API data with twitter data. This metric is twitter followers divided by age where age is estimate based on the oldest date of all time high and low.

The idea being looking for projects of low mc significantly higher up which may indicate projects with potential growth where popularity is a substitute for potential aka *wisdom of the crowd*.

It was that but I had a conversation with chatgpt about this metric potentially punishing older projects and it suggested using logs before dividing.

25/2/23,How crypto fixes money: Properly controlling the inflation rate.,"We all agree that the current financial system is simply unsustainable. And we also agree that crypto can fix it, but here is how I envision how:

First, let’s examine the basic flow of money in our current system. Let’s say there are X dollars currently in circulation. Where does that money go? Well as I see it there are four types of transfers. 

1. Purchases: Transfers to businesses (large or small) in exchange for goods or services.
2. Peer to peer: Transfers between individuals for any number of reasons
3. Donations: Transfers to charities.
4. Investments: A. Storage (in a bank or mattress) B. Purchase shares of stock C. Loans like bonds

In this 4th type, an individual is building wealth, by either saving their money, lending it for interest, or becoming what I will refer to as an “owner”. 

I think everyone will agree that Type 1 transfers are by far the most common. In fact almost, every dollar in circulation will eventually be used for a type 1 transaction. Money from type two can go to 3 or 4, but the charity will need to buy goods or services eventually. And money in type 4, unless stores in a mattress, is not taken out of circulation.

The point being, the flow of money is a whirlpool into the mouths of businesses. The question is what happens to it once it gets there? 

I will make a simple example of a pizza shop. Let’s say 4 people work at the shop and one person (not one of the 4 workers) “owns” it. The money spent at the shop all goes to the “owner”. The “owner” then spends some of it at other businesses to buy ingredients, pay utilities, etc. and then gives the agreed fixed amount to the workers. The rest remains with the “owner”.

Now expand this to the international scale. One can see that eventually all the money will end up with the “owners”. They also need to spend obviously, but they bring in more than they spend. In that way eventually they will get all the money. With a fixed X dollars in circulation one can see how this would present a problem. Once no one had anymore dollars to spend at businesses they would need to use other forms of payment. Eventually no one would use dollars and all those X dollars amassed by the “owners” would become worthless.

Here is our current solution to that problem: all the “owners” created and named themselves policy makers at a money printing company! This way, when the money supply amongst the “buyers” begins to dwindle and inflation starts to grow too fast, the money printing company can just print more money. But here’s the catch, the amount of money they print, and the way they inject it into “the economy” is designed such that the poor “buyers” are kept in a healthy band between:
1. Too poor to buy stuff 
And 
2. Rich enough to stop working for the “owners”

Well, I think we will all agree that system sucks. One way to fix it would be ban the “owners”. If you don’t contribute to the labor, you don’t get any of the profits. To do this we would need effective and progressive political leaders, so that won’t work.

BUT! There is another solution. As laid out by satoshi. Fix the supply of money! “But OP, won’t that just reintroduce the original problem?” Yes imaginary audience member, it will! But it will force the “owners” into submission. If the “owners” are not allowed to control the supply of money, they will not be able to direct all the flow of money towards themselves without mutually assured destruction. Any system they try to poison and steal from will be destroyed.

That was Satoshi’s vision. But one more problem exists. Even if the “owners” and other bad actors are cleansed from the system, eventually as population grows, a fixed supply of money will be spread too thin.
The decimal in Bitcoin can only move so far.

This is obviously a problem for future societies. But, my guess is, a crypto could be created with a growing supply, where the supply growth is algorithmically linked to population size. This way it cannot be manipulated by any central party.

Let me know your thoughts! This is how I envision the future of money, but I’m curious what other people see!"

Alan Turing is the father of modern cryptography.

The crypto he advanced is neatly woven thru protocols that safeguard our digital assets today.

Modern computing was born when he realized that only a machine could defeat a machine. Turing, Welchman, and the Bletchley Park team built the Universal Turing Machine and cracked the Nazi's Enigma code.

***On Computable Numbers*** presented Turing's most enduring idea: His mathematical theories made it possible to build a machine that could compute anything a human could. The machine decided what to do next.

That was a revolutionary concept in the late 30's. 

We're left to imagine further advancements he could have pursued if left in peace. Sadly, he died young. 42 years old. A cyanide-laced apple took his life. 

It's up to you to decide if it was suicide or not.

His attorneys urged him to settle. Phil knew the actual stakes. 

He fought. And he won.

25/2/23,Why banks and governments might not want you to buy or own cryptocurrencies?,"I often see this question and I have decided to write an explanation based on research I have done. Also I want to mention that it is not my own opinion so please do not hate me for publishing this :)

# Why your bank might not want you to buy cryptocurrency?

&#x200B;

There are several reasons why a bank might not want you to buy cryptocurrency:

1. Regulatory concerns: Banks are subject to strict regulations and oversight from government agencies. Many countries have not yet developed clear guidelines on cryptocurrency transactions, and banks may be hesitant to facilitate these transactions until there is more regulatory clarity.
2. High volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for their high volatility, which means their value can fluctuate rapidly and unpredictably. Banks may be concerned about the risk associated with holding or investing in cryptocurrency, which could result in significant losses for the bank and its customers.
3. Money laundering and fraud risks: Cryptocurrencies can be used for illicit activities such as money laundering and fraud. Banks have a responsibility to prevent financial crimes and may view cryptocurrency transactions as high-risk activities that could expose them to regulatory and legal sanctions.
4. Reputation risks: Banks are cautious about their public image and may be hesitant to be associated with cryptocurrency due to its reputation as a speculative and unregulated asset class. Banks may be concerned that being involved in cryptocurrency could harm their reputation and credibility.
5. Operational risks: Banks may not have the necessary infrastructure or expertise to handle cryptocurrency transactions securely and efficiently. The technology underlying cryptocurrencies is complex, and banks may not have the resources to develop the necessary systems and processes to handle these transactions effectively.

Overall, while some banks are beginning to offer cryptocurrency-related services, many banks remain cautious about getting involved in this emerging asset class.

# Why your government might not want you to buy cryptocurrency?

There are several reasons why a government might not want its citizens to buy cryptocurrency:

1. Lack of regulation: Cryptocurrency is a relatively new and unregulated asset class, and some governments may be concerned about the lack of oversight and regulation in the industry. They may view it as a potential risk to financial stability and investor protection.
2. Money laundering and illegal activities: Cryptocurrency has been associated with illicit activities such as money laundering, tax evasion, and terrorism financing. Governments may be concerned that cryptocurrency could be used to facilitate these activities and could undermine their efforts to combat financial crime.
3. Consumer protection: Cryptocurrency is highly volatile and speculative, which could result in significant losses for investors. Governments may be concerned about protecting their citizens from financial harm and may view cryptocurrency as a high-risk investment that should be avoided.
4. Sovereignty and control: Cryptocurrency operates outside of traditional financial systems, which could undermine the government's ability to control its economy and currency. Governments may be concerned about losing their ability to regulate their financial systems and may view cryptocurrency as a threat to their sovereignty.
5. Taxation: Cryptocurrency transactions may be difficult to track and tax, which could result in lost revenue for governments. Governments may view cryptocurrency as a potential source of tax evasion and may be concerned about its impact on their tax base.

Overall, while some governments have embraced cryptocurrency and developed regulatory frameworks to govern its use, others remain sceptical and may view it as a potential risk to their financial systems and economies."

Here is a good site to find a crypto ATM near you [https://coinatmradar.com/](https://coinatmradar.com/) and it list limits and what not.

&#x200B;

Major thing to note is the limits. For example pulling up a random ATM.

Notice it isn't a 1 size fits all.

Also note

# NOT ALL ATM ARE BTC ONLY

Most have many different types of coins.

Note each machine might be from a different company, and this means a new account. Also fees are different from place to place. That first link should help.

&#x200B;

# NOT ALL CRYPTO ATM WILL GIVE YOU FIAT 

Some of them are a 1 way. That will take fiat and send you crypto.

&#x200B;

Here is a good video on how it works [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpBPwcPQVD4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpBPwcPQVD4) About 4:22 min in it shows him physically using it.

# But it really comes down to several steps

Step 1: you will need to have your wallets prep. Basically you want to be able to have the machine scan a QR code so it knows where to send the crypto. It's not smart to manually type your address in.

Step 2: check if the machine will need KYC stuff. If so bring that.

Step 3: you need to setup an account, do KYC, and so on. It's best to get all that out of the way if you will do it often.

Step 4: depending on the machine you might do it prior or after KYC. But select the coin, amount, tell it where to send (use the QR code), and agree to whatever terms.

Step 5: Give it money. This could be physical fiat cash, or some card.

Step 6: Collect your Receipt. Sometimes it has important info you need for later on. 

&#x200B;

That's pretty much it. The biggest thing is watch out for the fees and what not.

  My situation is directly related to the CB debit card. When it first came out, I was excited about using crypto payment so I opened an account and put some money into USDC. I used it for about a year and then the novelty wore off for me. Long story short, after more than a year or inactivity, I was woken up by a message that said my balance in my Coinbase account was low.  So, I opened the app and low and behold, someone made a charge to a company I've never heard of and then they tried to run another charge with Discord but it was declined due to insufficient funds.  
 Now, I have 2FA on all of my accounts. I've had them set up for years at this point. And if I am able to link the image of transaction history, you can see there was a giant lag in time of use on the card.  Please keep an eye on your transactions or even skim through your histories, because 2FA did not prevent fraudulent charges and I honestly think it was an internal security issue.

25/2/23,How do you go about investing in shitcoins?,"I was a complete degen having a nearly all-alts portfolio. I recently started ditching them and going for a more solid portfolio with a big btc/eth pourcentage, but I'm not really sure what to do with my remaining shitcoins, especially those I accumulated during the bear.

For instance, I invested in shitcoins related to the new speculative narratives that emerged during the bear, like the ZK one. They currently account for a large chunk of my bags. Should I:

a) swing trade them, selling when BTC tops and buying in with the profit when it tanks.  They mostly follow its large movements anyway. I'm quite decent at TA so I do this by following BTC's supports and resistances.

b) DCA out and just keep selling when my shitcoins make new ATHs, while holding if they dip

c) Hold  my shitcoins  and keep DCAing into them until BTC reaches its new ATH. It kind of makes sense because new coins always have the biggest surges when btc breaks its last ATH.

I'm currently doing a bit of those three, which is really stressful because some of those strategies directly contradict each other. I would like to follow a more coherent strategy by sticking to one of them. Which do you think is the best?"

Option 1) all in on day one because ‘time in the market beats timing the market’. The logic here being that the earlier you get all of your funds allocated the more time all of them spend in said market.

Option 2) Daily DCA, say $2000 a day over the course of 85 days, obviously with the idea of levelling out the variance/ short term volatility as much as possible 

Option 3: Weekly DCA of $14k a week but on a predetermined day each week, on whichever has historically been the weakest day on average, price-wise?

Are any of these mathematically more optimal than one another? Is the DCA strategy really just more of a psychological less stressful way to move into a market rather than an upside optimisation strategy?"

Realistically speaking, stable coins are the only crypto coins where you can truly make an argument of them being digital currencies. However, when we're referring to the mainstream coins such as BTC, ETH, XMR, that's not exactly the case.

We judge these coins values based on their utility. Similar to Gold, BTC's utility is that it is a store of value, hence why we call it the digital gold. Ethereum's utility is its smart contracts, Monero's is its privacy.

Commodities work the same way in the sense that their value is based on their utility, Oil's utility is fuel, Gold and Silver utility is being a store of value.

As we approach a more digital world, there will be a demand for digital utilities and that's where crypto comes along

Some of you probably heard that new numbers from the US Federal Reserve indicate inflation is not winding down but instead rising back up.  This can hurt high-risk investments (most of cryptoland if not all).  

Ben offers a good breakdown of the ""PCE Index"" this all recently stemmed from in a [recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLdbypYhZds).  This stands for ""Personal Consumption Expenditures"".  Even though it sounds like it's about people, PCE is a measure of the cost of goods and services for businesses.  The people one is CPI, or Consumer Price Index, and it focuses on the cost of goods and services for households (e.g., ""the cost of eggs is too damn high"").  

TLDW; while there is a recent uptick in PCE, which suggests inflation is back on the rise, Ben thinks it will start drifting back down within a month or two and that we are still on a good trajectory in terms of inflation.  A concern is that the fed will overreact and make a big rate move in response to this PCE report.  That or any further rise in inflation can hurt any high-risk assets (the crypto we ❤️)."

25/2/23,Did the US Government promote Crypto by blocking the Safe Banking Act.,"“SAFE Banking Act, a bipartisan measure that would undo federal restrictions that make it difficult for legal cannabis businesses to access financial services.”

Looking at correlations between cryptocurrency and cannabis. 

Cryptocurrency designed specifically for the cannabis industry: There are some cryptocurrencies that have been created to cater specifically to the needs of the cannabis industry. These cryptocurrencies aim to provide a secure, decentralized, and transparent way for cannabis businesses to conduct transactions without the need for traditional banking services, which can be difficult for businesses in this industry to access.
 
Cryptocurrency used to buy and sell cannabis: While the legality of cannabis varies by jurisdiction, in some places where it is legal, there are people who use cryptocurrencies to buy and sell cannabis. This is because cryptocurrencies can be used for anonymous and secure transactions, which can be useful for people who are looking to purchase cannabis without leaving a paper trail.

Cryptocurrency as an investment opportunity in the cannabis industry: There are also some investors who see potential in the intersection of cryptocurrency and the cannabis industry. This could mean investing in companies that are working on blockchain solutions for the cannabis industry, or it could mean investing directly in cryptocurrencies that are designed for this purpose.
It's worth noting that the legality of both cannabis and cryptocurrency varies widely by jurisdiction.

That being said, cutting off the ability for cannabis companies to bank with the Fed is creating a need that cryptocurrency is filling. Its either that or fail.

“Untold numbers of smaller cannabis companies that were waiting for SAFE Banking and don’t have easy access to capital may soon go out of business, industry executives warned.”"

I really want to be a part of this financial revolution, but **I need to spend much less time on price-checking** while still being on the train to the future.

One perspective that got to me was this one: 

The definition of **envy** is to want something that others have; on the other hand, the definition of **jealousy** is that you're afraid of losing something.

I've heard from someone much wiser than myself that you can live with some envy ^((most people do, for example those who spend hours downvoting the daily general discussion post)), but you can't live with jealousy because it will tear you apart. By this logic, I should either learn to a) not let my emotions control me or I should b) quit crypto altogether. As if I could quit now that I've been orange-pilled.

Should've listened to r/CryptoCurrency from the start, but oh no, I'm smarter than all of you combined.

I was dabbling with crypto for about two years before I made any plan. I've burned my paper hands so often.

>!I've purchased crypto on a P2P platform and learnt my lesson to not take the trade off-platform.!<

>!I've dabbled in crypto games like Axie and STEPN and had considerable losses.!<

>!I've dabbled in top 10 coins like Matic, ALGO, LRC, DOT and Polygon and managed to buy high sell low so many times that I must have lost about 80% of what I've put into these.!<

After these lessons, I decided to make **the plan**. 

# The plan

1. Get hardware wallet
2. Choose one crypto to stick to (ended up choosing BTC)
3. Buy crypto on CEX weekly
4. Transfer to wallet monthly

I followed **the plan** for two months. It gave me peace of mind and I was starting to go outside again, talk to people and enjoy music again. It was a good time, really. I know that it can be hard to see in writing if a person is being sarcastic, but I'm not.

# ... the plan changed

Now I find myself in the same unhealthy pattern that I was in before. It all started one evening when I read an article about grid trading, and it sort of rolled from there.

After two days, I'd set up a grid trading robot with the BTC/ETH pair.

A few days later, I decided to use what I would DCA for ~~one week~~ two weeks to margin trade.

Now, a few weeks later, I keep thinking about going into futures.

That's why I'm writing this post.

25/2/23,"How about we let the FED raise rates, buy even more of the dip at dirt-cheap prices and then the inevitable rate cuts happen and we lift off?","The past year and this year, it has always been the when we talk about the BTC price and the next move we have the FED in our conversation. This is due to a lot of factors: The FED raising rates makes it difficult for many of the retail to take loans and the invest those in the stock market or Crypto but also the high positive correlation with the stock markets that Crypto has especially during sideways-movements.

&#x200B;

[Bitcoin correlation with other asset classes](https://preview.redd.it/5a8ozcfmhdka1.jpg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6b454ff9e06c34aa41ea44de372150affeb851d4)

That correlation is undeniable and especially during bear markets Crypto usually follows the Stock markets a lot which act according to the next FED decision. Obviously we also have periods of negative correlation to stock markets as right now but its rather rare.

Crypto is acting like a risk-off asset for this bear market and thus lets imagine that the FED even raises rates higher because they actually want to achieve 2% inflation or because inflation is re-accelerating. Now that would cause for BTC to drop further or just have sideways movements as we would be too much under pressure to have any power to move up.

What does this mean? Well, you will be able to buy even more Crypto at dirt-cheap prices for a longer period, I am sure that people just dreamed of buying at the current prices in 2021. Then the FED will have to aggressively cut rates anyway as they can not risk a recession or too bad of a drop for stock markets (look at 2008 and 2018).

So what do you think about this idea of rather embracing the FED rate hikes than fearing them because we will be able to buy Crypto at cheaper prices for longer?"

This follows a charge from the New York Attorney General’s office to get the exchange to cease operations in New York. Nothing else is clear right now, so CoinEx might just be taking preemptive action before any federal bodies get involved.

Customer locations were determined by IP address and the affected users will have 60 days to withdraw their crypto from the exchange.

Most people here won’t use CoinEx, but this is another blow to the crypto space in the US and is indicative of a hostile environment to crypto. Unfortunately, some coins will be hit by this news too; Banano for example is only available to trade on CoinEx, meaning the project will lose out on a large chunk of the American market.

The US government’s approach to regulation of new technology is depressing to say the least. With the smaller CEXs unable to grow, it drives the industry towards a CEX monopoly in which only the biggest players can exist. As always, those worst affected by these decisions are the small retail investors like your or me."

According to a report from  the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (USA), there are about 136 american banks promoting crypto.

25/2/23,Does Nakamoto coefficient match your assessment of projects?,"A recent project going down again makes me think about decentralized concepts that are over my head, it’s weird, every aspect of Solana screams “centralized” but supporters always quote the Nakamoto coefficient . Either it’s the wrong metric, not applicable or I’m wrong. My general take is that the many Bitcoin nodes help keep it decentralized. I think Cardano has less institutional influence, less centralization because I know people running stake pools and everyone seems to have a bag of Ada staking. I understood Eth until POW and I feel it’s sacrificing centralization for speed and energy savings, which I think will work out great but censoring is now a thing. Thinking of other top 10s like polygon, it’s been great for me but so much whale ownership also scream “centralized”.  
I know I’m not breaking this down systematically and sometimes it’s nice to take a step back and squint your eyes and just examine the vibes each project is giving off and if it’s consistent with its technicals. When I do that I feel it explains and shows my biases and why I might stray from technicals. I’m not looking for shills, maxis, and haters, but have you ever just examined how you feel about chains. Specifically, how centralization may need a new metric, because it doesn’t feel right but I’m not sure why."

For a newbie trader, you are told to buy and hold and wait for the next bullrun to profit, religiously following the famous DCA. However, your greed sets in and influences you to try and make more money ASAP! 

**1) Influencers:** You learn about TA, strategies, patterns and whatnot, you implement some and start winning! But comes the time of tweets, when Elon Musk tweeted about Doge and your short position has been instantly liquidated. Or you buy the hype and get sold the news, with your new bag already losing value. Let me not get started at other influencers shilling coins and exchanges for their benefits.

**2) ICO and Rugpulls:** After getting excited about a new coin being listed, you want to get in on it fast! Only to notice that it already pumped before even being listed. Your hard earned money is quickly losing value as your clarity starts increasing, you have been rugpulled. My experience was recently with Hiseals after being listed on Kucoin, as we speak it is trading at 0.015, down from 0.039 usd. Only people who have bought at a ridiculously low price are sitting comfortably. I bit my wound and sold at a loss, hoping that this shame have enlightened me. 

**3) If it's too good to be true, then it's not true:** Ranging from scams, private DMs, needing more people to enter in order to be sustained, having a shady group of people running the coin, and my favourite of them all, the ""Dude trust me"" sources.

25/2/23,Hot take: I think the fact that Russia is using crypto to circumvent sanctions is exactly why we need crypto and it's to powerful,"Hey everyone

Ok, so before you click that downvote button, hear me out on this

Even though many of us around here are not fans of the actions of Russia, that is not the point of this post, and I certainly don't want this to turn into a discussion about politics

So imo this is a huge win for crypto as a whole and a very much real life scenario proving it's worth

 - You have a situation where a centralized entity is cutting off access to a global payment network as a result of the actions taken by governments
 - the majority of the people affected are not high ranking government officials, just regular people
 - Crypto is unphased. Those controlling can hoot and holler all they want, but those people are taking their own finances into their own hands and standing their ground, and I can't blame them
 - The more news coverage of crypto use there is in Russia, the more bullish on the technology I get

Just some good old fashioned decentralized, censorship resistant, trust-less money

Really don't know what the point of this post was, but hopefully we have a good discussion instead of knee jerk reactions due to Russia being the subject probing the awesomeness that is crypto.

Have a great weekend everyone. I hope you all get your lambos soon

Let's cut right to it, I may not have much time: A Bitcoin, or any other Crypto that is dormant, is not necessarily dead. We do not know if Satoshis Bitcoins won't move again. They could be considered dead, but they could also be sleeping. A seed phrase passed on for 100 years could open a vault of Crypto that was considered dead, but can raise again.

And if the ""old ones"" awaken, the Satosh-Coins and all that Crypto that apparently is lost, this occurrence might indeed trigger apocalyptic consequences for crypto. Like the awakening of cthulhu. Cthulhu is the fear of the unknown, the fear not to know if the dead Crypto is really dead.
Also Cthulhu means Domus sunt krip to in Proto-Latin. Or it could mean that. Think about it.

*""With strange eons even death may die""*. That is basically now. We had a President Trump, we have now Biden, we could have a President Trump again, we had a Pandemic, we have war in Ukraine we have 6000 Genders and everyone is mad and offended all the time. And we have Al emerging. Times ARE strange.

When we upload our consciousness into the cloud, ""Death"" will die. But when we go to the other side, we can't take our Dollars with us. Neither our Euros, Pounds or Clams. But we can take Bitcoin and Crypto to the other side and we can own it in a way, so that the outside world can't take it away from us.

25/2/23,Bull market. My perspective.,"This could be the ""bull market"". It went from 16k to 25k that's pretty close to 2x. It doesn't have to go past it's ATH to be a good run. That's why I don't like terms like bear market and bull market because they give everyone the idea that it's supposed to be high but the reality is that Bitcoin started at 0 not 100k. Anything above 0 is good. Each bull run we see how high it can reach. Gradually over time it will increase in value, but it's ATHs isn't where it should be it's just how high it reached. You got in at the wrong time and you cant enjoy the bull run because it won't reach the price you bought in at and now your waiting for the ""bull market"" but you missed it. You should have kept throwing in and you could have evened out but now things are too uncertain.

Alts go up with Bitcoin so if you want to make money invest in those. In my opinion those will always outperform Bitcoin in terms of gains

End of rant.

Here's hoping for continued upward movement from the market.

25/2/23,Convince Me to Buy Bitcoin over Other Cryptocurrency,"I’ve been digging a lot deeper into cryptocurrency this year. One question that I constantly ask myself is “why buy Bitcoin?”.
Bitcoin tech seems to be antiquated, developer base seems to be trying to fit a square peg in a round hole, other blockchains offer way more benefits than Bitcoin. Compound that with the fact that five developers have the master keys to bitcoin core and these developers are compensated via grants, it doesn’t feel as solid/reliable as people say.

Please prove me wrong. I want to buy bitcoin. But my intellect/logic is telling me no the more I learn and read.

I feel like everything I see or hear from people talking about bitcoin are talking points but they don’t really know what they’re saying. It feels very cultish."

Remember to take breaks from crypto. You have to clear your mind or you will be stressed all day and go in depression.

I am 19 and I felt like 70 because of crypto. I took a break in summer and I feel much better now. I plan to take another break this summer too.

Maybe its time for you to take a break too. Its bear market anyway, so you probably wont sell anything right? Maybe do some DCA and give yourself a little rest. You have to be mentally ready for the next bullrun.

25/2/23,100k EOY 2021!,"I’m bored, let’s smoke some hopium and make price predictions. 

The last three cycles we saw gains of roughly 10x, 20x, and 7x respectively.  As we know, these correlate with the BTC halvings resulting in new all time highs in 2013, 2017, and 2021.  We are on track for another halving in 2024, which could see new highs by 2025.  Obviously, whatever, no one can predict what’s going to happen, but the halving is like a festival now.  Smart people buy extra tickets early and scalp them later. 

Anyway, the moving average is about 20k, so anything less than that is an accumulation zone.  Let’s be super bearish for a second and say 16k is the accumulation zone.  Let’s also say we see even smaller percentage gains than any cycle, maybe a 6.25x.  That puts us to 100k!  

I really do believe 100k could be the low end of a 2025 prediction.  This is why some people really don’t care, even when we hit super low numbers.  Keep accumulating and hide in your bear cave!"
25/2/23,Confession: I hate Bitcoin...but...,"For years now, I've been anti-crypto.  I've called it a Ponzi...I've compared it to tulips...I've found pleasure in the markets grinding down over the past year.  I've hated all the cryptards with their rocket emojies and asking ""wen moon?"".  I'm a metal stacker.  I love gold and silver.  But despite all of this, I just bought some Bitcoin, and here's why.

First off, I want to give a shout out to my man [Jerry on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_VEbZRk9LeDItX_uphKqhA).  He too is a metal stacker.  He too is a patriot.  But unlike me before today, he owned Bitcoin and considers himself a Bitcoin ambassador.

While I still do not think that Bitcoin has intrinsic value, it's not really the intrinsic value that is important here.  Like gold and silver and other hard assets, the premise behind Bitcoin is to opt out of the ""doll hair"" system.  Objectively, it makes little to no sense to hold any substantial amount of money in cash/dollars.  The government excess and debt policy will inevitably fail.  This is a massive alignment with the metals community, and common ground on which I can build.

And though I love metals, we do and will continue to live in a digital age.  The longer I've stacked metals, the more obvious it has become that that we will not transact in metals again.  Bitcoin makes me uneasy because I cannot physically touch it, but I see its transaction value.  And while I do foresee CBDCs and overregulation/restriction by the government, metals and Bitcoin together can provide a risk-diversified portfolio that enables individuals to protect their wealth from multiple possible scenarios that spell doom for the dollar.

For that reason, I will be moving towards a 50/50 metals/Bitcoin portfolio outside of 401k/Roth/HSA investments.  All other income not directed to tax-advantaged accounts will go to metals and Bitcoin (and no other crypto).  Diversification is important as we must prepare for all outcomes.  We do not know how long the dollar system will remain, thought we do know that it is eventually going to fall and must prepare for that, as well.

Anyway, this is a long-winded way to say, I've spent a lot of time shitting on crypto, and most of that is still valid.  However, there is a laudable goal in Bitcoin, despite the clownery of the rest of the crypto world.  There is greed in every asset, but many of us are just trying to make it through the awful mess we see coming.  Thank you."

I bought a significant amount of bitcoin DCAed from 1/4@60k 1/4 @50k 1/4 @ 40k 1/8 @ 30k 1/8 @ 20k (I did buy at 16k but not much) I was told I could sell my bitcoin and immediately buy it back and I would be able to write off (apx $125k ) off my capital gains taxes. I bought the bitcoin through Coinbase institutional with my businesses treasury reserves. My question is (and yes, I have asked my accountant but I want to hear if anyone has actually done this) do I get to offset these losses with the profit my business makes or is capital gains a different revenue source (like stocks )what is considered capital gains? if my business makes 125k in 2023 do I essentially pay zero taxes?? Also would it be wise to buy back the entire amount in one shot or should I DCA back into BTC? if it does down from 24k I make about 9k for ever 1k BTC goes down. Forgive my ignorance I should know more about this especially with the amounts I have invested but I guess it's never too late to learn"
25/2/23,After Bitcoin Core synchronizes. You need to confirm it’s online!,"This post is for the noobs who just like me synced their nodes very recently. Also I want to admit that I was an idiot thinking my Bitcoin Node was ""online"" supporting the network for a whole month, when in reality it was just sitting there. 

I was trying to connect a widget to my node to read some data over my network. that's when I realized I can’t access it. 

After a little of research, I found a way to check if my node was online (which is on the Bitcoin Core website: https://bitnodes.io/#join-the-network) and it kept returning errors. 

After some more research I realized I need to configure my router to forward port 8333 and allow my firewall to pass through inbound connections. 

tl;dr, after you sync your node, confirm it’s actually online. Peace."
25/2/23,Immutability as a weakness,"Debating with my brother tonight - he argues that immutability is a weakness in the real world because we don’t want mistakes or fraud to go unaddressed. 

He’s saying that the risk of fraud through our regulated legacy trusted intermediaries (banks, visa, law firm trust accounts etc) is a lot lower than the risk of mistake or fraud for the average person transacting on an immutable blockchain.

25/2/23,"Let's Talk About ""FUD"" )Not what you think... )","Let's talk about the term ""FUD"".   

I think the reaction of calling every idea about about Bitcoin you don't like as ""FUD"" is ridiculous.  It's the same intelectual laziness by which liberals attribute any type of disadvantage to racism or sexism and the way conservatives dismiss any information that doesn't align with their world view as fake news.  

They are all just excuses of self-righteous defensiveness. 

I know even the biggest Bitcoin influences throw this term around, but I would urge you to have deeper thoughts when questioned about bitcoin. By not leaning on the knee-jerk reaction of ""FUD"" you will provide a better understanding to the person asking the question and it will also force you to deepen your own understanding and philosophy of why Bitcoin works. 

And that is exactly why the term is unnecessary and lazy, because all the typical arguments ""FUD"" against bitcoin have very clear explanations that anyone willing to learn how money works can easily understand. And if that person doesn't what to take the time to understand bitcoin, that's fine. They will just have to buy bitcoin at the price they deserve.  

I've often posted here that Bitcoin does not care about semantics, but I think this idea is more than just semantics. It's about promoting a more intelligent discussion around bitcoin, which also requires the respondent to also improve their own understanding.  

Cheers!"

25/2/23,Hey guys. I need some help. I always buy bitcoin in centralized apps so was thinking move to my own wallets. What you think is a good wallets? Need some recommendations. Thank you.,
25/2/23,Bitcoin is already better than gold and wire transfers. Why not to push the narrative on this fact to start?,"We all know Bitcoin is way more than gold 2.0, but basing on the current state of the art (high fees and verification waiting time), the network is not (yet) capable of fully substitute FIAT as a time/cost efficent medium of exchange.

That said, BTC can already outperform metals as a store of value and the FIAT system as a medium of exchange for large amounts. With an average cost of 1,80$ per fee and a 10mins average for payment delivery, the Bitcoin Network can fully replace conventianal investment assets like gold and silver with nothing but advantages, and also be a more reliable and efficent way to send large quantities of money **wherever**/**whenever/to whoever** needed, as opposed to the traditional banking system. 

So why is people so reluctant, at least this is my impression, to promote Bitcoin as a substitute for gold or wire transfers? High volatility is obviously something one doesn't want to deal with when talking about saving purchasing power, but after all this is ""just"" a matter of adoption. 

If the ecosystem was more eterogenous and wide, whales wouldn't be able to have such an impact on fluctuations as they have now. This is exactly why metals prices are more stable than BTC.

I've always thought that the main problem of the Bitcoin industry is the lack of a coordinated (not centralized) marketing and promotion net, with the ambition of tackling on/debunking the mainstream narrative. What we have achieved until now is just an annuity life on the undeniable disrupting features of this technology, a passive approach. I'd like to see more ""aggressiveness"" for those about presence on media, sponsorships and promotion. Something professionally managed.

We, the Bitcoiners, need to talk to people in a different way, addressing more tangible facts already observable, rather than the future prospects inherent to Bitcoin mass adoption.

Not saying YOU should do it, I'm saying the Bitcoin Organization, for example, should."

25/2/23,Fees and shrimps. Question about small money moves and large fees.,So I moved $30 (0.00121 sats) USD from CB to ledger and the transaction fee says it was $18.462 USD (0.00079608 sats). I'm wondering if that's accurate and where it drew the fee from? It has to come from the receiving wallet right? So I tried to send myself $30 and CB took a fee. Then sent the transaction and My wallet paid the $18.426 and I really only got like $10 out of it?
25/2/23,How can I buy and send btc to wallets quickly?,"Used to use cakewallet but it’s been buggy lately. Are there any good ways?

24/2/23,Bitcoin is supposed to be decentralized money of the future. And yet it will fail and get centralized eventually.,"Yeah I said it. But it's for a completely different reason than you might think.

Let's go straight up sci-fi:

It's April 20th, year 2420. The Empire of Mankind finished terraforming Mars almost a century ago and you are living there. You send a video message to your mom, and leave for lunch. Right now the distance from Earth to Mars is the average 225 million kilometers, so the message will reach her in about twelve minutes. She has to record her own message, that will take her about ten minutes. And then twelve minutes that her message travels back to you. That's 35 minutes before she'll respond. Hell 25 minutes is the absolute minimum thanks to speed of light.

You might already know where this is going.

The Bitcoin block time is ten minutes. Each new block is based in the previous one (hash). That means to be at least slightly capable of mining BTC you need to be within ten light minutes away from from the propagating nodes of the previous block to be able to receive info necessary to calculate the new block before someone within the distance does it before your machine. Average distance from Earth to Mars and Venus is 12.6 and 3.75 light minutes respectively. That time is what you are losing mining wise compared to those physically closer to the machine that mined the previous block. Oh yeah, and if you calculate the block you still have to deliver the block to other nodes to get them confirm your block. Good luck beating the laws of physics. The Earth is now the 'central mining bank' of the interstellar financial world of The Empire of Mankind thanks to speed of light limiting it's spread.

25/2/23,Alex Pertsev has been in jail 198 days.,"While we all are hopefully enjoying a relaxing weekend let’s not forget that Tornado Cash developer Alex Pertsev has now been in arrested for over 6 months! 

According to Dutch authorities, Alexey Pertsev is “suspected of involvement in concealing criminal financial flows and facilitating money laundering through Tornado cash”. Hmm.

Where this story goes is anyones guess but remember that at least in America we are all innocent until proven guilty. This doesn’t seem to be the case in Netherlands. 

I feel the crypto community has fallen asleep on this case and our support and anger towards it has toned down massively. Really hope this sub and other crypto communities on reddit, twitter and other platforms raise their voice loud again about this situation and the way it was handled. Really feels like this was a slap in the face to privacy and open source code. Plus I really liked and miss 🌪️💵

If you’d like to learn more about Alex and what some people are doing to inform others and help his cause I am including the link to the official site. Hope this is ok.

The rise  of Bitcoin and other digital currencies have brought the world a step  closer to a decentralized economy. However, with so many digital  currencies out there, it's hard to tell which one is right for you. In  this post , we'll explore why BitcoinCash is more than just a  cryptocurrency exchange. It's a complete solution.

25/2/23,"Seriously, lock your card.","Seen a couple reports of suspicious activities in this thread already so just adding to list here... I receieved a scam email that my phone number has changed, click this link to update blah blah blah(5 other random recipients along with me were CCed in the email). Also incurred a fraudulent charge from botomak.biz (very small amount, likely just a test transaction to fish for a sucker). Luckily my card was locked but I went ahead and reported this card and ordered a new one out of abundant caution. No links were clicked, no fraudulent charges were successful... THIS TIME!


Seriously, if you have a CB card it should remain locked until right before the moment you intend to use it. We are under attack from this apparent data breach, defend yourself.



P.S: 3 scammers DMed me within 10 minutes of posting this, keep them coming... my ""mark as spam""  skills are unmatched."

25/2/23,2-step auth: stop in a never ending loop with support,"I´ve had issues login into my account for many months now and finally decided to contact support. My problem is that I am not recieving the 2-step authentication SMS to my phone, and with the help of Coinbase support I have tried EVERYTHING to fix this, but keep on going around in circles and getting the same messages from them over and over again. I have literally done everything they have said 5 times at least. 

After doing account recovery, verifying with ID etc etc, I try to change the 2-step to Google Authenticator, but to accept this change, it wants me to verify via SMS - which is the original problem - that I am not getting the SMS. How on earth is this system built so bad? 

Support just keeps emailing me the same stuff over and over again, and I keep explaining over and over again that im doing everything they say but THAT IT DOESNT WORK.

I feel like im going insane and that im never gonna get into my account again.

Is there anyone that has managed to work out a solution for this?"
25/2/23,Can’t Send From Coinbase Wallet?,"I’ve been making weekly buys on coinbase and have been sending these weekly buys to a different wallet. Today when I went to send my most recent purchase, coinbase tells me I do not have the minimum amount of coins in the wallet to send however my wallet displays well over the minimum. This hasn’t happened to me before in the year of DCA’ing I’ve been doing. Anyone else having this issue?"
25/2/23,Worst support I've ever encountered,"A couple of years ago I moved to Switzerland. In the interim, I lost my phone and my authenticator app for coinbase.   


Now I can't log in because I don't have the 2FA app, and I can't verify using my Swiss ID because my account is originally based in the UK. The automated authentication doesn't give me the option to use a passport, and I don't drive.   


So the ID verification process doesn't work. I've spent nearly two months trying to get the Coinbase support people to disable 2FA so I can login via SMS, but they seemingly can't comprehend this and keep sending me the exact same email about doing the validation step. It's like talking to a chat bot or something, the don't seem to even read my emails. 

All I need is for coinbase support staff to switch my account back to SMS based 2FA. I've provided copies of my passport, government ID and even bank statements, but they still are seemingly unable to even grasp the nature of the problem.

They recently suggested that because the account is set to a different country they could only change it if I agreed to forfeit my entire fiat balance! NOT ACCEPTABLE. 

I am so tired of dealing with this, I have send around 100 emails and been in contact via twitter, tried the helpline (which is apparently out of commission), all to no avail.   


Any suggestions?"
25/2/23,Looking for information about recovery process,"The account unlock/review process is 100% automated, no human involved. So I am curious what is going on behind the scenes in the hours/days before an account is unlocked. Edit: Was told there apparently is a human factor..?? I was told before a human could not unlock it even though it should never have been locked in the first place."
24/2/23,Error making purchase using Coinbase,"This is my first time making a purchase using Coinbase but I've had my account for a while. I enter my email address under ""enter customer details,"" and then I get an error that says ""Checkout Error: Sorry, we couldn't generate a new charge."" And then a retry button. Tried a few times on different browsers, still nothing. Is this likely to be an issue with Coinbase, or an issue with the merchant?"
25/2/23,Coinbase account locked out after new phone,"I recently got a new iPhone but did not know that it would affect my ability to get into my coinable account via the google authenticator. 

&#x200B;

I've tried updating my authenticator app multiple times with my driver's license however it keeps getting kicked back with an ""unspecified error."" The photograph is not blurry and completely legible. I've sent a trouble ticket with coinable support. Case #14711329. However, they just email me back with  the same troubleshooting steps listed on their website. 

&#x200B;

I suspect the issue may be the fact that my driver's license does not have a expiration date. I am active duty military and the state of TN has issued be a case 30 exception. This is clearly denoted on the back of the driver's license. Is there a way to submit these documents to a human for a manual review so that I can get back into my account?"

25/2/23,How can you use a crypto wallet with weekly limitation of only €300?,"Just a bit frustrated... I was making a purchase for a blockchain TLD which required me to make the purchase with cryptos from a crypto wallet. The purchase is about $550. The whole transaction can only be made at the full amount in either USDT or BUSD. So I opened a Coinbase account and a Coinbase wallet, but Coinbase will not allow me to buy crypto currency for more than €300 per week, which is not enough to cover the purchase. What's the point with a wallet you're not even allowed to fill up using your own money? Now I have to wait a week to make the purchase, if it's still available... 🥺"
25/2/23,Purchase on hold,"Purchase is on hold and I have not been charged yet. The status says completed, and yet my account has not been charged. My crypto is already down almost 100. Because I can’t send/transfer I’m stuck in limbo. Never had this before. What would happen if my bank doesn’t accept the charge from Coinbase because I go to another exchange? I want my money/Crypto now. Not 2 weeks from now. Not possibly have my bank charged two weeks from now."

25/2/23,Not receiving device verification emails,"As the title says, not receiving emails. Tried multiple browsers and the mobile app, requested emails multiple times. 

Tried using coinbase ""message us"" feature on the help page, but of course you need to be signed in to actually get help. 

I've reached out to Coinbase support by creating a case,, but I just got the standard email (*check spam folder and trash .."" - yeah I did that already...)

25/2/23,What makes an account recovery be canceled?,"Tried for the third time to recover my account which should not have been locked in the first place.

25/2/23,Sustainability in the Crypto Space,"The growth of the crypto industry has raised a good amount of concerns around its environmental impact. This space requires a significant amount of energy consumption for activities like mining. However, there are a number of upcoming blockchain solutions that are aimed at addressing these concerns.

Sustainability in regards to the crypto space is about reducing the carbon footprint of mining and transactions. Traditional proof-of-work (PoW) blockchains like BTC require a significant amount of energy. However, we have seen an increase in sustainable blockchains that use alternative consensus mechanisms such as proof-of-staking (PoS) or delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) which require significantly lesser energy to operate.

In this thread, we explore sustainability in the crypto space further with the help of some examples of sustainable blockchains and the work they're doing.  

1) Cardano (ADA):  Cardano is a PoS blockchain which uses a consensus mechanism called Ouroboros. This mechanism has a much lower energy consumption than traditional PoW blockchains allowing its network to process transactions faster and more efficiently than traditional ones.

2) Algorand (ALGO): Algorand is a PoS blockchain which uses a consensus mechanism called Pure Proof of Stake (PPoS). This mechanism has been designed to be more secure and energy-efficient than which in turn allows for fast transaction processing and low fees.

3) Elysium (PYR): Elysium is a sustainable blockchain which uses a DPoS consensus mechanism, making it more energy-efficient than traditional PoW blockchains. Elysium also has a strong commitment to sustainability beyond its mechanism- this blockchain is carbon-negative, meaning it removes more carbon from the atmosphere than it emits. Additionally, their blockchain uses sustainable energy source, which further reduces its carbon footprint. 

4) Harmony (ONE): Harmony is a DPoS blockchain which uses a consensus mechanism called Effective Proof of Stake (EPoS). This is designed to be more energy-efficient than traditional PoW blockchains, and it allows for fast transaction processing and low fees.

To summarise, sustainability is an important aspect to consider when talking about the crypto space and sustainable blockchains are emerging as solutions to address these concerns. As the industry continues to evolve, its important to prioritize sustainability to ensure its long-term viability. 

What are some other interesting sustainable blockchains or their mechanisms?"
