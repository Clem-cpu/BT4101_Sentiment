5/3/23,I am happy crypto has finally decoupled from Elon Musk Tweets and news.,"Since Elon started buying crypto, any tweet from him either brings the market down or up.
In the case of Doge, Elon helped in making the price soar by his tweets.

It was unhealthy when his tweets was affecting the price at time.
If he sells market sees red moment,
If he says he is not buying bitcoin the market goes down.

But guess what, this time Elon actually said "" i used to be in crypto but now interested in AI"" 
After that tweets that even suggest he is out of crypto, the market never crashed.

5/3/23,"Don't forget that during the bull run, everyone begged for these prices to buy","In 2021 when Bitcoin hit $70K, everyone regretted the fact that they hadn't bought before the surge and wished that the prices would go down so they could keep buying and making returns by then. Everyone was begging for these prices that we are really scared at right now. That it would only go down once more so that they could buy it. 




Instead of being scared if you believe in Bitcoin, this is the real time to stock up for the next bull run. Paying attention to every news and every event to predict prices isn't the way to go about when investing. 






If you had browsed the sub then, you already know how when it just kept going up, everyone did regret the fact that they hadn't bought before even though they did believe in it. A little patience goes a long way.


Not chasing the highs and the lows but instead DCAing seems like the best strategy in a market that's so random and acts as volatile."

5/3/23,"5 years ago, the founder of LTC sold and donated all his LTC","As Litecoin grew in popularity, [Charlie Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Lee_(computer_scientist)) (creator of Litecoin) became more involved in the cryptocurrency community and began to realize that his personal holdings of Litecoin could be perceived as a conflict of interest. He was also concerned that his large stake in the cryptocurrency could affect its price and stability, which could ultimately harm its users.

So, in December 2017, Charlie Lee ( u/coblee ) shocked the cryptocurrency world by announcing that he had sold all of his personal holdings of Litecoin. He explained that he wanted to ""de-risk"" his personal investment in Litecoin, and that he believed that the cryptocurrency was strong enough to survive without his personal influence.

5/3/23,"The entire Silvergate Situation explained and why the Fiasco is so fascinating. How they lost $1 Billion, and how [SERIOUS] the risk is for Silvergate is to fail.","First off, let us make clear what Silvergate it. Silvergate is, by all accounts, a bank i.e., they accept deposits from customers and use the deposits for loans to other customers. Of course however, they accept cryptocurrency deposits and although they only allow lend USD-denominated loans that that *backed by Bitcoin collateral.* They also allow customers to transfer funds to each other just like a bank does.

Now, we need to establish a base. In 2021,Silvergate reported 1,381 customers on the platform, an increase of more than 400 from 2020. Additionally, SEN transfers totaled $787.4 billion, up significantly from $135.7 billion in 2020. So 2021, was a good year. We know and remember this from the 2021 bull run.

Now for 2022, there are some hiccups. And these hiccups lead up to where we are now. Silvergate has recently stated it would not be able to file its annual report with the Securities and Exchange Commission on time. The report specified is actually for 2022, as the actual report is typically released a several weeks after the actual timeframe in question as accounting simply takes a fair bit of time. But why would Silvergate miss their deadline. Well this is where it gets really interesting.

Remember, for 2022, i said there were hiccups. Well, firstly, we don't have an annual report for 2022. But we do have quarterly reports for all four quarters. Here's what it reveals.

Skipping some accounting stuff, Silvergate has experienced consistent and significant growth throughout 2022.

\[Their amount of customers increased by 15% and 6.6% between Q1-Q2 and Q2-Q3 respectively. Net income increased 64% or $15.1 Million and 14% or $5.3 Million between Q1-Q2 and Q2-Q3 respectively. \]

But Q4 was...bad. Silvergate took a loss of 1 Billion in Q4 and lose 3.3% of customers. They profited **only** 43.3 ***Million*** the prior quarter of Q3 but lost 1 ***Billion*** in Q4.

But why did they lose so much? Well, remember what happened in Q4. The whole FTX saga? Technically, Bitcoin ""only"" lost 20% of its value in Q4 due to that saga. Silvergate had 1.5 Billion in BTC-backed loans in Q3. Assuming an 100% or more collateral ratio, which is very common in crypto, this means that Silvergate should have only lost $300M on the BTC collateral. Then, Silvergate reported having to sell $718M in assets at a loss to allow 8.1 Billion in withdrawals in the wake of the FTX collapse. Thus, we come to $1B loss, through collateral losses and assets sales.

At the end of Q4 their loans dropped from 1.5 Billion to 1.1 Billion and some customers almost definitely defaulted. In the worst case, Silvergate had $400M in forced liquidations, but from which they held onto the BTC collateral.

***But here's the really fun part.***

Whatever losses Silvergate took on customer default, they held onto the collateral. Since the beginning of this year 2023, Silvergate BTC collateral has increased 30%. This means that Silvergate would be in significant profit of 30% of more on a few hundred million up the presumed worst case $400M BTC collateral from liquidations. And this profit is **not** reflected in the Q4 2022 financial report. The extra $700M or so should be covered due the the previously reported assets in Q3  Additionally, typically the largest expense of a business is employee wages, and 40$ of staff was cut in January. The financial statement reports that \~50% of their expenses was due to ""Employee Salaries and Benefits"". Again, these savings would **not** be reflected in the Q4 2022 report. They also yesterday reported cutting the SEN Exchange network, which allowed customers to transfer deposit funds to each other, which was probably a non-performing asset anyway as customers could simply use native crypto networks to transfer without paying Silvergate fees. This lowers Silvergate costs even further.

If you want to argue that they over-hired, they already cut 40% of stuff to reduce costs. If you argue on their loan losses, that those have already been erased  as BTC bounced back. If you want to argue their loss of deposits and customers, their losses and amount of customers, their deposits and customers are FAR higher than it was the previous year even after accounting for those related losses they faced in 2022. Basically, 2023 is much healthier than 2022 Q4 Silvergate.

Severely underestimating the recovery Silvergate made from their BTC collateral, and assuming the only broke-even on the $300M loss, Silvergate should have had somewhere around at least $1.2 Billion in assets that allowed them to absorb the excess $731 Million in losses from their asset sale. Thus, discarding customer deposit, their worst case should leave them with around $400 M in free fully-owned assets to date, even after accounting for the \~1.4% losses on their morgage backed securities, which accounts for about half their assets.

However, the make or break is that very recently a number of big exchanges have scaled back operations with Silvergate in the wake of these fears, which would reduce their deposits. To cover withdrawals $8B in withdrawals, they were forced to sell assets at a 14% loss. If there is another bank run, Silvergate would have very little free cash and assets left, to the tune of a few dozen to maybe a few hundred million, which is essentially almost nothing.

But even then, Silvergate still has the option of going into debt to keep the business running, and use profits to pay off this debt over time. There won't be the largest pool of willing lenders, but banks are extraordinarily well-connected to obtain credit/to borrow, especially for just a few hundred million, a pittance for large financers, which will be all Silvergate needs to weather through. They also still have the option of raising collateral requirements on current borrowers.

TLDR: Outside of actual and large-scale financial misconduct/fraud, nothing shows Silvergate is likely to surely fail, but they are certainly heavily stressed. They should be in, a worst case, a small profit or more likely in huge profit from early 2023 gains on loan collateral from any borrowers that failed to repay. They have already cut 40% in employees that amount to half their expenses. And between their high total loans, healthy loan-to-deposit ratio and dynamically adjusting their collateral ratio on borrowers, and the option of going into debt, it in unlikely for them to fail.

5/3/23,We just became the second largest pool on SushiSwap for the Arbitrum Nova Network. With rewards from CCIP-051 currently sitting at 45% APR and total APR at 57%.,"Moons/ETH just became the second largest pool on SushiSwap for the Arbitrum Nova network, after flipping the USDC/DAI pool.

[https:\/\/www.sushi.com\/earn\/arb-nova:0xd6c821b282531868721b41badca1f1ce471f43c5](https://preview.redd.it/o40nvznuqyla1.png?width=1479&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0e3cf6ab99da0e529f6d7035ede05ec79b407f8a)

Liquidity has been growing since CCIP-051 was announced. We had 23 WETH in liquidity when rewards were first announced and we're now up to \~76 WETH in liquidity.

[Graph provided by \/u\/maxx3141](https://preview.redd.it/g1oejzoiiyla1.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5241fb0e2eaed9488319a93644f23f66c28c3f16)

We need TVL to grow another roughly 50% to surpass the ETH/USDC pool and become the largest Pool on Sushiswap for the Arbitrum Nova network.

The APR for the [Moon/ETH Pool](https://www.sushi.com/earn/arb-nova:0xd6c821b282531868721b41badca1f1ce471f43c5) is 57% and is broken down by the following rewards:

* **CCIP-051 rewards:** 45%
* **Sushi rewards:** 2%
* **Trading Fees:** 10%

\--------------------------------------------

If you want to provide liquidity ~~(to help Moons flip the ETH/USDC pool)~~ to take advantage of the rewards, you can check out out [this guide](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1140y3e/the_complete_and_extensive_guide_for_getting_your/).

If you want to provide liquidity but are worried about being wrecked by impermanent loss you can check out [this informative post](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/11b6a6g/an_indepth_yet_simple_guide_to_help_you/) to help understand impermanent loss, and what you can do to minimize the risk/impact.

\--------------------------------------------

**VERY IMPORTANT:** If you are currently providing liquidity make sure you are staking your liquidity tokens to be eligible for CCIP-051 rewards and Sushi rewards. Currently 20% of liquidity on SushiSwap is not staked and therefore is not earning CCIP-051 rewards and Sushi rewards. Step 6 of [this guide](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1140y3e/the_complete_and_extensive_guide_for_getting_your/) will tell you how to stake your liquidity tokens.

Of course APR from set rewards will drop as more liquidity is added.

\--------------------------------------------

EDIT: APR for CCIP-051 is so high because liquidity is so low. The rewards provide an extra 1,260 Moons a day  - That's an extra 459,900 Moons over a year. ^(If leftover mod rewards don't change.)

With the circulating supply at 106M Moons. **That's less than a .5% increase from the liquidity rewards over the course of a year.** It's 46% because liquidity is so low. If liquidity quadruples rewards will drop to 11.5%."
4/3/23,Do you actually have a plan for the next bull cycle?,"Or do you just tell yourself that you will take profits?

Without a written down precise plan you will most likely be tempted to ride the wave higher and then feel stuck on the way down bag holding. 

A couple of things that I took into account last cycle that really helped me:

1. Previous resistance zones heading back to ATH. Yes we can argue all day whether or not TA is real or astrology for men, but it can’t hurt to set levels to take profits before the big ones.

2. Take into account the fomo and absolute excitement of the next bull cycle. Set sell targets at realistic prices that will genuinely make you happy you made that money and feel less fomo.

3. Journal every time you feel fomo as it’s going up and how much you “regret selling”. You’ll be able to have a good laugh at yourself in the next bear market and remember for next time.

4. Pay attention to what price targets YouTubers and influencers are aiming for, take some profits well before.

5/3/23,Sushiswap Moon Liquidity Rewards now live,"As per recent governance poll CCIP-051 - Moon liquidity rewards are now active. 

Liquidity providers have currently contributed 527411 moons and 65.2942 ETH to the pool.

**7.50 SUSHI** and **1.26k** Moons are currently being divided up between liquidity providers **per day**

Naturally the amount of rewards will diminish over time as more users add to the liquidity pool, and less moons are available to be dispensed as rewards, but this appears to be a great opportunity for the early birds.

This is allowing advertisers to more easily purchase moons for renting out the subs banner.

It takes a community to raise a moon afterall.

5/3/23,"Did you know that when transferring on Ethereum, it costs ~40% more gas to send tokens to a zero-balance account, and also 10% less gas to empty out an existing account's balance.","####**TL;DR**

There is a little-known secret about Ethereum gas fees that you probably won't know unless you're an EVM dev or have studied Ethereum's [Yellow Paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf) of fee schedules.

* It's **~40% more expensive** to send tokens to a zero-balance account than to positive-balance account.
* It's also **~10% cheaper** to empty out an existing account's balance when transferring.

Some exchanges like Coinbase already take advantage of this rule to save on gas fees.

####**Here's why - Let's get technical:**

**In Appendix G** of the [Yellow Paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf), you can find the **fee schedule**:

* **Gtransaction**: 21k gas - Paid for every transaction
* **Gnewaccount**: 25k gas - Paid for a CALL or SELFDESTRUCT operation which creates an account
* **Gsset**: 20k gas - Paid for an SSTORE operation when the storage value is set to non-zero from zero
* **Gsreset**: 2.9k gas - Paid for an SSTORE operation when the storage value's zeroness remains unchanged or is set to zero
* **Rsclear**: 5k gas - Refund given (added into refund counter) when the storage value is set to zero from non-zero

Thus if you create a new balance, it costs ~20k gas extra. If you destroy a balance, you get a refund of 5k gas. The reason the fee schedule is set this way is to reflect the cost of storing additional account data.

Here's an example of this for the CRV token:

* To an old account while emptying the sending account: [29449 gas](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x10384ce3e3afe2ab00d4ea0174ed7ca8d64cd55d3f1593dec6352fe974eaffc2)
* To a new account and NOT emptying the sending account: [51349 gas](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x69040134761c179dd4e3d54eddfbb58f09636ca0f4a3bbfac2902b5153f45a8e), a 17.1k + 4.8k = 21.9k gas increase

If you look at the GETH debug trace, the difference between sending to a zero and a non-zero account is that **SSTORE** costs **2900 to send to positive-balance accounts** and **20000 to zero-balance accounts**, which is a 17.1k gas difference. On top of that, emptying the account is 4.8k gas cheaper due to **Rsclear**.

Every token is different and has slightly-different gas fees. But you'll find the same differences everywhere.

**Examples of sending USDC on the Goerli testnet**:

* Account to non-zero account: [**48424 gas**](https://goerli.etherscan.io/tx/0xe2523bb6daeaf9e0053751ed1bc20da8d8cc8f508f3e6503baad5e2b3b22da17)
* Account to zero-balance account: [**65524 gas**](https://goerli.etherscan.io/tx/0x08fb724ef3906b812902874463aabae557ed8b042cdfd607f75fe986ccc2f648), 17.1k more
* Emptying account to a non-zero account: [**43624 gas**](https://goerli.etherscan.io/tx/0x5702db4d596116598645cbe034e6cadc6e530e0674ac004edaa3134323bd9cea), 4.8k less
* Emptying account to a zero-balance account: [**60724 gas**](https://goerli.etherscan.io/tx/0xe131605e4a690c31d5f8cc457707eed6691d631fc9538949f9cff0d4368093a6), 12.3k more

Thus it's always cheaper to send to an account with an existing balance, and also cheaper to clear an existing balance. Note that this only applies to transfers that use a smart contract. A normal ETH transfer that doesn't use a smart contract will always cost 21k gas regardless of existing balance.

####**How centralized exchanges already take advantage of this**

**Coinbase is a great example of an exchange that exploits this gas fee rule.** Coinbase uses different processes when sending to positive-balance accounts vs zero-balance accounts.

* [Coinbase 10](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa9d1e08c7793af67e9d92fe308d5697fb81d3e43) makes batch transfers to old accounts with balances
  * The more transfers they batch at once, the cheaper per transfer.
  * Here's a 17-batch that [cost only **12k gas** per transfer](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2c24800927df435f393eeb7290db10e88cb072012206feb78753e96164ec08d1)
* [Coinbase 2](https://etherscan.io/address/503828976d22510aad0201ac7ec88293211d23da) makes single-transfers to new accounts without balances
  * This is always **21k gas** for a normal transfer. If they tried to batch-transfer these using a contract, it would actually cost them 30k gas due to Gnewaccount.

**Thus, for ETH transfers, it's better to use batch transfers to send to positive-balance and normal transfers to send to new zero-balance accounts.**

Extra side note: Coinbase usually charges withdrawal fees at ~10x their actual cost of network fees. So they're totally ripping you off on withdrawal fees.

####**How can you take advantage of this?**

Realistically, I don't expect of you to change your bad habits. And most of you aren't making enough transfers for this to matter.

But here's what you can do:

1. For Bitcoin, the best privacy practice is to spin up a new address for every transaction and never reuse addresses. Do NOT do this for Ethereum-like networks for tokens transfers. You will end up paying ~40% more for every transaction.
1. If you can avoid it, don't leave token dust when transferring from your wallet accounts. Just empty your old account for a small gas savings."
5/3/23,"finally got some of my coins off exchanges, Because of moons!","I was really afraid of using hot wallets cuz of the big initial learning curve and the fees were too much for a small holder for me, but last moons distribution changed everything! .... I can no longer ignore the amount of moons I have right now, according to current price, they are worth 2x my current salary (3rd world country citizen).

So after I got so many moons , coincidentally many great guides for accessing moons were shared in the subreddit, i followed the instructions and was able to see my moons ! Horray! ... Now next step was getting in some eth for gas fees and the transaction fees for arbitrum one were soo low i decided now is the time to get all my eth of the exchange and took some of it from ARBITRUM ONE TO ARBITRUM NOVA and bam now i am ready to buy , sell , provide liquidity with moons.

Thanks guys for the knowledge you guys shared, cuz of which i finally got my majority of folio off the exchanges while also learnt a lot about moons

5/3/23,"17.4M ETH are staked right now, which will be open to withdraw after the Shanghai update. Majority of them are also at loss right now.","Last years biggest and probably the most anticipated crypto event ever, The Merger for Ethereum, is indeed a milestone for possibly all of Crypto. Here you can see a post where I talk about the immense energy reduction due to the Merger. But obviously it was not all done yet, while investors lock their ETH on a PoS contract to stake there was no way to withdraw it, yet.

This will be changed through the much-awaited Shanghai update which just as the Merger had been delayed a couple of times. Now it is scheduled to come out this or next month as the Testnet was successful in early February.

A massive 17.4M ETH have already been staked and 4M of that were just staked after the Merge. Here is an outlook on the average price of ETH when they got staked:

We can see that the Realized Price (average deposit price) for ETH2.0 stands at about $2.1k and we are below that right now meaning that most of the staked ETH were staked at a loss. This could have several effect:

1. A wider sell-off as many would just get rid off their losses and get the best out of them as possible.
2. Surprisingly no sell-off at all after the Shanghai Update as people would much rather like to sell once they are back in profits which the majority will not be.

Let‘s see how this all unfolds, nevertheless the Shanghai Update will be another big milestone for Ethereum."

5/3/23,What is your end game?,"Do you have a plan for your crypto? 

I feel like we all get into crypto for a reason. That reason is different for every person. 

Personally, I do have a plan. My goal is to use crypto to max out all tradition investments to the point where I just live off of dividend payments. Most of my profits go towards this goal. 

This plan has been in the works for 4 years and it’s a 10-15 year plan, with any luck. I will be one step closer to that goal at the end of this cycle. 

I’m tired of working and honestly, I just want to buy my freedom and continue living a frugal, simple life. No fancy cars, houses, just less work. 

Oh, and the most important thing, get out of bed when I want to get out of bed. No more alarm clocks! 

I will always have some exposure to crypto and I’ll continue to stack sats and increase my stack, but I like to take the more traditional approach with the bulk of my investments. If crypto doesn’t work out, the other plan will.

5/3/23,Here are the top Moon tippers for each month since 2020,"Moon tipping has got a lot of attention recently, so I decided to calculate the top tippers since May 2020, when Moons were launched.

For the data below (which is all public data), I define a tip as a transaction that:

1. Is between two Redditor vaults
2. Is an integer amount between 1 and 100 (larger amounts are often not tips)

After my post, two weeks more of stats were made public by CoinDance.

23 BTC and 7 BTC (the real ""final"" week), so even when people knew it was shutting down some people were still using it (remember it was measuring only the trades, to the withdraws).

Just wanted to share that!

I wish Binance, Reserve, AirTM would make public their stats :(

Situation? The same, exchange rate 25 Bs. (Bolivares) / USD, monthly minimum wage 5 USD and average wage around 120 USD monthly. 

And yes, moons have been a really nice income (I just used some of mine to provide liquidity, lets see!)

5/3/23,What will it take for a bull to return,"Do you think its as simple as a historical halving cycle and we should reach ATH about a year after the next halving as we have in past cycles?

Do we need regulation to assist with risk and have more institutional money flow in to blast off?

Does something like the end to the war in Ukraine and shipping obstacles for grain to ease so the global economy can ease inflation?

Curious what other factors need to happen for the bear to end.  While I personally think we will need global conditions to improve and the halving isn’t enough.  As long as there are layoffs, high inflation, wars, poverty, people struggling, there just isn’t money to flow into risk on assets.  And I fear the direction the US is taking with regulation will move everything offshore so exchanges don’t have to deal with it and that will be even less money allowed to enter the market."
5/3/23,Tipping has been an important part: The dogecoin tipping incident (2014),"As my first and only 10 moons that I have has been tipped by another user for which I'm very thankful.

While I was doing some reading on crypto I stumbled upon some interesting information from 2014.

The Dogecoin Tipping War was a fun and quirky event that took place in early 2014 within the Dogecoin community on Reddit.

It was a spontaneous competition among users to send each other large amounts of dogecoin in an effort to outdo each other.

The dogecoin community was known for its friendly and generous nature, and the tipping war was a way to showcase that spirit. The tipping war quickly became a sensation, with users tipping each other thousands of dollars worth of Dogecoin.

The tipping war gained media attention and was covered by news outlets around the world, helping to raise awareness of dogecoin and the cryptocurrency market as a whole.

During the tipping war, one user even tipped another user over $11,000 worth of Dogecoin, which was a massive sum at the time.

The tipping war continued for several weeks before eventually dying down, but it had already helped to establish dogecoin as a fun and friendly cryptocurrency with a strong community.

That event is now considered a seminal moment in the history of cryptocurrency, as it demonstrated the potential of cryptocurrency to bring people together and create a sense of community.

It also highlighted the power of social media in promoting and popularizing new technologies.

Now coming back to our own homegrown boy ""moon"" tipping has really inspired some people like me to get involved in this community in a meaningful way.

So if you can please do tip moons to people who have like ""0"" or next to nothing moons to inspire them the way I got inspired.

I don't know if tipping is good or bad here, but all I can say is that it will bring our sub get united under one front called the ""moon""."
5/3/23,Reminder that you could suffer 'impermanent loss' when staking / providing liquidity on SushiSwap,"Some of you might not be aware that you can actually miss out on gains [while staking your Moons](https://www.reddittorjg6rue252oqsxryoxengawnmo46qy4kyii5wtqnwfj4ooad.onion/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/11ckvml/a_complete_beginners_guide_to_staking_moons_on/) or maybe you don't know how it works (just like I didn't know until today).

# How does impermanent loss happen? (easy example)

Let's imagine two guys. I've chosen typical US names because most of you are from the US: Cleetus and Tyler. Both will invest $3200.

* Cleetus buys ETH along with his Moons because you can only provide liquidity with two Tokens that are being traded on SushiSwap. He holds **8,000 Moons and 1 ETH,** which is both the same amount in USD (1,600USD). He will earn **x% APY** for providing liquidity.
* Tyler decides to hodl. He buys **16,000 Moons** instead.

# One year later

ETH didn't make any big moves and is still around 1,600USD, while a **Moon is now worth $0,80.**

* A liquidity pool has to hold equal worth of Tokens. Arbitrage traders took advantage of that and exchanged Moons for ETH. As a result, **Cleetus now holds 2,000 Moons and 4 ETH.** That's $9,600, nice! He also earned 5% APY.
* Tyler still has his juicy 16,000 Moons, they are now worth **$12,800**

As a result, Cleetus missed out on gains. Still, it is called *impermament* loss. As long as they don't sell, it's not realized. But if you believe in the future of Moons, you will also believe that they will do better than ETH in a bullrun. ETH already has almost 9,000x of Moon's market cap!

# tl;dr

Your staking reward has to be high enough to cover for impermanent loss in the future. If Moons climb much faster than ETH, you will suffer impermanent loss."
5/3/23,Starting again with an empty account after being into crypto for 5 years. What I learned.,"I got into crypto during the bear after the 2017 bull run. Btc had reached its top at approx 20k and it had started falling. I got in when it was around 10k. I used coin base, not even coin base pro. I purchased some and I watched it fall more and more. 


At some point I discovered coin base pro and was fascinated with the trading aspect. I was looking at charts, order books etc all day long, but it made a small difference to my account since I had a small account and there was no leverage, nor low market cap coins which could make big movements. 


Then I discovered Binance. When I discovered Binance the price of btc was around 4k. I started experimenting with trading a lot of alt coins. Some days were good and some days were bad. I managed to make some profit trading alt coins and I had 0.9 btc. 


At that point I discovered BitMex and margin trading. I started making bets with 100x leverage. That 1 btc, gone. Very quickly. I kept putting more money and I kept blowing up my account. Overall I have gambled around 100 ETH (I used ETH whenever I wanted to fund my account on Binance and then I would swap it for btc and then xbt (BitMex btc). 100 eth, today is worth around 150k. During its all time high, the total eth that I chose to gamble instead of save, was worth half a million dollars, but I was not in possession of it anymore. 


Recently I started investing in agix cause I believe that it will get big. And it did really well. I got in before the pump of the ai coins. I said to myself that I will set it and forget it. I wasn’t able to do so. I wanted more agix before I set and forget. I sold it all and opened a 20x long on btc thinking that with the profits I will buy more agix. And this brings us to the last dump that occurred which liquidated me for one more time. I was thinking that I had learned my lesson. I didn’t use 100x. Only 20. Well…still dangerous as it seems. 


Now I have decided to start again. But I won’t gamble. At least that’s what I say at the moment. You never know with problem gamblers like myself. I will try to stick to my new plan, which is to dollar cost average into the Binance and CMC Index (the top 10 cryptos, the blue chips). That’s it folks. 


TLDR: leverage bad, gambling addiction real, trying a new approach"
5/3/23,Just how early are we?,"We see a lot of “we are early” or “ mass adoption is so far away”…. But what do the numbers say for Crypto usage, adoption or actual users? 

To start with the actual users or wallets for crytpo…

As of August 2022, the number of crypto wallet users reached 84.02 million worldwide, from 76.32 million users in August 2021. The increasing growth in crypto wallet usage can be attributed to the growing use of cryptocurrency.  Soon those yearly growth numbers will be 100 million or more per year…

Source - https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/crypto-wallet-market-report

With a population of approximately 8 billion people this is .0105 of the population…. 1%!!

Now thinking that a lot of us have multiple wallets, a lot of institutions, business, exchanges who have many wallets and that number goes down even further, less than 1%..

Think about that, less than 1% of the world population is involved in Crypto vis a wallet.  Now I wasn’t able to confirm what number of these wallets include people holding on exchanges, not your keys not your crytpo, but to keep it simple we can keep the math.

The first Bitcoin was released in 2009,  so 13 years since inception.

December 2013 there were approximately 890,000 users or wallets

December 2014 2.71 million

December 2015, 5.34 million

December 2016 10.69 million

December 2017 21.51 million

December 2018 31.91 million

December 2019 44.51 million

December 2020 63.48 million

December 2021 80.24 million

https://www.statista.com/statistics/647374/worldwide-blockchain-wallet-users/

So we can see that the number of wallets, and hopefully users is steadily increasing year over year.  Simple case uses like nfts have driven larger gains in users or wallets over the past years and Reddit is sure to drive this growth even harder which helps the entire crypto industry.

We are still in the birth stage for crypto,  it’s new, it’s whacky, and people are mostly taking a wait and see.  There is a lot of scams, it’s the Wild West.  The hiccups we seeing are needed to shape the market and industry.  As things mature and calm down, more will jump in. 

The early adopters are now fully in I suspect and things should be moving into the second phase of growth very quickly.  This comes as case uses grow, real world usage and adoption grows.  Think of countries, open seas, or the Reddit marketplace when and if it’s launched. More uses more users.

There is an old saying that the tipping point for adoption of any product or thing is normally 25%.  Once 25% of a group have grown to like, use and trust something, it will then grow to the rest of the population.

https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-25-revolution-how-big-does-a-minority-have-to-be-to-reshape-society/

Seeing the numbers above and how small a percentage of people have adopted or are using.  We are early.  Amazingly early.

I will dca, I will Hodl in projects I believe in, and..

We…. Are….Early…"
5/3/23,How often should you claim your Liquidity Rewards for Maximum Yield?,"Let's face it, we are all hyped about Moon liquidity rewards right now, so let's further hype it by checking how we can maximize our yield!

In theory you would want to claim rewards as often as possible and add them to the stake. However in reality this will quickly saturate, and simply not be worth the effort once you reach a certain rate. More important: You pay a fee for each time you claim and add to liquidity, so if you do it too often your yield will drop.

Luckily Nova has super low fees. Considering you harvest your reward, swap half of it for ETH, add it to liquidity and stake it again, your fee should be about 0.0000073 ETH or about 0.011$. Pretty amazing for 4 onchain transactions.

Let's look at 3 examples with 100, 1k and 10k moons in liquidity with the current numbers. For this I took **ETH @ 1570$**, **Moons @ 0.203$** and rewards **APR @ 43%**:

&#x200B;

[APY with 100 moons in liquidity](https://preview.redd.it/w343wiu3rzla1.png?width=1484&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d47b0c1c6726f4c58ef24254b9e7988c2d94ecac)

&#x200B;

[APY with 1k moons in liquidity](https://preview.redd.it/283obtv7rzla1.png?width=1484&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cd43981ffa788fef24fcfe20feabcd2c4956291f)

&#x200B;

[APY with 10k moons in liquidity](https://preview.redd.it/yt9dbq19rzla1.png?width=1484&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9cae8ee64d207c09ee26458bc4349e439655b97c)

With an APR of 43%, you can in theory reach an APY of over 53%.

If you hold only **\~100 moons** in liquidity, you shouldn't claim too often. **Once or twice per month** will be close to the best performance.

With **\~1000 moons** in liquidity your performance is best at **claiming weekly.** If you have \~10k moons in liquidity, you could even claim daily, but weekly will almost have the same performance.

But no matter how hyped you are right now, please don't claim your rewards every minute!"
5/3/23,YSK: You can earn crypto donating your computer's spare computational power to science. Feel good and stack coins at the same time.,"Who says proof of work has to be a bunch of otherwise meaningless hashes? Maybe we could put all that computer power to good use?

Folding @ home and BOINC are two platforms for volunteer computing which are incentivized by cryptocurrencies. Folding@home works on protein folding (which is relevant to many areas of medical/biological research) and BOINC is a platform with 15+ projects in areas from protein folding to finding black holes and drug discovery.

You don't need to be a computer expert to earn coins doing this, in fact I'd say it's way simpler (and more rewarding!) than traditional mining.

Folding @ home is rewarded by Banano, Gridcoin, Dogecoin, and Curecoin. Gridcoin can be earned at the same time as Curecoin which is nice.

BOINC is rewarded by Gridcoin, they reward about a dozen of the available BOINC projects. If you're interested in learning more about BOINC, check out /r/BOINC4Science. BOINC has more CPU-only projects so you can make the most efficient use of your hardware (no need to compete with other users who have GPUs/graphics cards).

Both of these programs can be configured to run only while your computer is not in use so they don't slow anything down. Or you can run them while it's in use, just give them a little less resources than normal to keep things running smoothly.

It's a fun way to give back and stack some coins, I've been doing this for years and it's nice knowing that I helped scientists working on new cancer treatments.

PS If you're interested in learning more about how crypto can help science, /r/cryptoforscience is the sub for you. It's a coin-neutral space to hear the latest from the DeSci movement."

5/3/23,The UK government is hiring for the head of their CBDC programme. The pay is dreadful and the project is doomed.,"The UK government is/was hiring for a role entitled ""Head of Central Bank Digital Currency"", evidently a hiring to accelerate their mission to release a digital CBDC version of the British Pound, as suggested [here.](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2023/the-digital-pound-consultation-paper)

There is one problem however, the position's pay caps out at £66.5k. Admittedly, this is more than I earn, but it is nowhere near sufficient to hire a competent senior software engineer, let alone an engineer sufficiently skilled to lead a major project in a nascent field. 

I believe the UK government has completely underestimated the scale of the project a CBDC will require and unless something radically changes, the project is doomed to fail.

5/3/23,Coffeezilla vs Radio Shack DEX/Tai Lopez,"Tl;Dr: Radio Shack DEX teams are non-responsive, Coffeezilla is finally on the case.

Here's some background: Last year, Radio Shack Twitter sprung to life with raunchy, off the wall tweets. We're talking NSFW content. At one point, they even scored a ""viral"" post about ""If you find a squirter, marry her."" People had no idea why this iconic American electronics brand had gone off the rails, so to speak. 

Crypto was the answer. It had to be crypto... Radio Shack launched a Decentralized Exchange, and not one, not two, but FOUR tokens. This was all for their ""Starfish Liquidity"" protocol outlined in their whitepaper. 

I had been following prior to the infamous ""squirter tweet"" and, like many, had fond memories of shopping at Radio Shack brick and mortar stores as a kid. I thought the idea of a Radio Shack DEX would be a big hit for a few reasons. The weight of the brand, the support of the retail stores, the revenue offline... it just like it should work. 

Where are we today?

The socials for Radio Shack DEX are locked up. Coffeezilla is finally taking notice. There's a lot of liquidity that was supplied by listed projects that needs to be accounted for, and the dev teams can't get a response from anyone on the team anymore. 

Now, the other brands under the same ownership are in trouble? Yikes. The link to the Coffeezilla thread is below. 

Is anyone else tracking all this? Never a dull day in crypto.

5/3/23,Anyone still interested in ALGO?,"Where is the Algo hype?

I bought my first ALGO a couple weeks ago, after doing some research on it. I heard about the project just recently, from a friend. Also, I'd like to mention that I've only been in the crypto space for about 4 months.

I really consider Algo to be a very solid project. The fact that it's a purely proof of stake coin makes staking your tokens really easy. The wallet is also very easy to use and intuitive and I've just joined their community and it seems to be one of the kindest subreddit on the platform.

A couple of months ago, I kept seeing a lot of posts about this topic. I didn't mind it as it helped me learn more about it. I'm just curios where are the Algo fanboys since it seems that besides the price going down(sadly), everything is going well. The smart contracts are there and the fundamentals didn't change.

Also, I'm looking into XLM since it seems to be more stable compared to other coins and I might use it to transfer some money from a wallet to another and I didn't find any better coin to do that. Do you have any advice?

Thanks and have a great day!"
5/3/23,White Paper(s),"A couple years ago before I really started to take this seriously I had a friend as me a simple question when we were talking about some potential investments down the line. 

He asked “have you read the white paper?”

I honestly had no freaking clue what he was talking about. After a few seconds of awkward silence I swallowed my pride and asked him “wtf is a white paper?”

As found on google: 

A cryptocurrency whitepaper enables projects to explain their products and goals to their audiences. Projects can freely choose what kind of information they want to provide, but whitepapers usually include an overview of the project's goals, tokenomics, products, features, and information about the team


I’m not here to shill any project in this post but any potential investment in this space has a white paper. Some white papers are more lengthy than others. I encourage you to read a coin / tokens white paper before pressing that buy button. 

Thanks for taking the time to read. I hope this post can help someone out or at least start a healthy conversation."

5/3/23,The People of Page 9; Part 1: Wei Dai,"# THE PEOPLE OF PAGE 9 (Part 1)

Satoshi Nakamato achieved in two years what most can't during a lifetime. But even accomplished people seek inspiration. Satoshi was no different.

Who are the people that Satoshi looked up to? I know of at least ten.

Each will be post-featured individually throughout the week. Let's get started.

▔▔▔

**Wei Dai**

[Wei Dai](https://preview.redd.it/9ojqo69ymxla1.png?width=637&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a5424741022751aa924b6a705fb5edbf5cee8af2)

Wei Dai is the most influential figure in crypto that you don't know about.

He prefers it that way. His concept project, **B-Money**, presented ideas that would inspire Satoshi to work on Bitcoin.

Satoshi communicated with Wei during the summer of 2008. He informed Wei that he would soon release a paper that expands on his ideas and invited him to read the advanced white paper draft.

This passage from Dai's 1998 paper formed the seedbed for Bitcoin, 10 years later. It showcases key ideas that Satoshi would later refine and actualize with the release of Bitcoin.

**B-MONEY; 1998**

I am fascinated by Tim May's crypto-anarchy. Unlike the communities traditionally associated with the word ""anarchy"", in a crypto-anarchy the government is not temporarily destroyed but permanently forbidden and permanently unnecessary. It's a community where the threat of violence is impotent because violence is impossible, and violence is impossible because its participants cannot be linked to their true names or physical locations.

Until now it's not clear, even theoretically, how such a community could operate. A community is defined by the cooperation of its participants, and efficient cooperation requires a medium of exchange (money) and a way to enforce contracts. Traditionally these services have been provided by the government or government sponsored institutions and only to legal entities. In this article I describe a protocol by which these services can be provided to and by untraceable entities.

I will actually describe two protocols. The first one is impractical, because it makes heavy use of a synchronous and unjammable anonymous broadcast channel. However it will motivate the second, more practical protocol. In both cases I will assume the existence of an untraceable network, where senders and receivers are identified only by digital pseudonyms (i.e. public keys) and every messages is signed by its sender and encrypted to its receiver.

In the first protocol, every participant maintains a (seperate) database of how much money belongs to each pseudonym. These accounts collectively define the ownership of money, and how these accounts are updated is the subject of this protocol.

**1. The creation of money.** Anyone can create money by broadcasting the solution to a previously unsolved computational problem. The only conditions are that it must be easy to determine how much computing effort it took to solve the problem and the solution must otherwise have no value, either practical or intellectual. The number of monetary units created is equal to the cost of the computing effort in terms of a standard basket of commodities. For example if a problem takes 100 hours to solve on the computer that solves it most economically, and it takes 3 standard baskets to purchase 100 hours of computing time on that computer on the open market, then upon the broadcast of the solution to that problem everyone credits the broadcaster's account by 3 units.

**2. The transfer of money.** If Alice (owner of pseudonym K\_A) wishes to transfer X units of money to Bob (owner of pseudonym K\_B), she broadcasts the message ""I give X units of money to K\_B"" signed by K\_A. Upon the broadcast of this message, everyone debits K\_A's account by X units and credits K\_B's account by X units, unless this would create a negative balance in K\_A's account in which case the message is ignored.

**3. The effecting of contracts.** A valid contract must include a maximum reparation in case of default for each participant party to it. It should also include a party who will perform arbitration should there be a dispute. All parties to a contract including the arbitrator must broadcast their signatures of it before it becomes effective. Upon the broadcast of the contract and all signatures, every participant debits the account of each party by the amount of his maximum reparation and credits a special account identified by a secure hash of the contract by the sum the maximum reparations. The contract becomes effective if the debits succeed for every party without producing a negative balance, otherwise the contract is ignored and the accounts are rolled back. A sample contract might look like this:  K\_A agrees to send K\_B the solution to problem P before 0:0:0 1/1/2000. K\_B agrees to pay K\_A 100 MU (monetary units) before 0:0:0 1/1/2000. K\_C agrees to perform arbitration in case of dispute. K\_A agrees to pay a maximum of 1000 MU in case of default. K\_B agrees to pay a maximum of 200 MU in case of default. K\_C agrees to pay a maximum of 500 MU in case of default.

**4. The conclusion of contracts.** If a contract concludes without dispute, each party broadcasts a signed message ""The contract with SHA-1 hash H concludes without reparations."" or possibly ""The contract with SHA-1 hash H concludes with the following reparations: ..."" Upon the broadcast of all signatures, every participant credits the account of each party by the amount of his maximum reparation, removes the contract account, then credits or debits the account of each party according to the reparation schedule if there is one.

**5. The enforcement of contracts.** If the parties to a contract cannot agree on an appropriate conclusion even with the help of the arbitrator, each party broadcasts a suggested reparation/fine schedule and any arguments or evidence in his favor. Each participant makes a determination as to the actual reparations and/or fines, and modifies his accounts accordingly.

In the second protocol, the accounts of who has how much money are kept by a subset of the participants (called servers from now on) instead of everyone. These servers are linked by a Usenet-style broadcast channel. The format of transaction messages broadcasted on this channel remain the same as in the first protocol, but the affected participants of each transaction should verify that the message has been received and successfully processed by a randomly selected subset of the servers.

Since the servers must be trusted to a degree, some mechanism is needed to keep them honest. Each server is required to deposit a certain amount of money in a special account to be used as potential fines or rewards for proof of misconduct. Also, each server must periodically publish and commit to its current money creation and money ownership databases. Each participant should verify that his own account balances are correct and that the sum of the account balances is not greater than the total amount of money created. This prevents the servers, even in total collusion, from permanently and costlessly expanding the money supply. New servers can also use the published databases to synchronize with existing servers.

The protocol proposed in this article allows untraceable pseudonymous entities to cooperate with each other more efficiently, by providing them with a medium of exchange and a method of enforcing contracts. The protocol can probably be made more efficient and secure, but I hope this is a step toward making crypto-anarchy a practical as well as theoretical possibility."

5/3/23,What are you doing?,"I’ve seen people like Benjamin Cowen say that in bear markets, it’s foolish to buy alts because they’ll bleed against BTC and ETH. While there’s some truth to this, it’s also a great time to accumulate alts which are thought to outperform BTC and ETH when the bull market comes. We know that it’s usually silly to time the market so wouldn’t it make sense to accumulate both to be ready for all scenarios?

I’m not asking for advice because I already know what my plan is. Buy cheap alts. However, I love talking about crypto so I’m wondering what your plans are? 

Bear market is still in full effect so stay safe out there everyone!"
5/3/23,"To redeem or continue earning BAT from the Brave Browser, you will soon need to connect a custodial account","TL;DR: Brave is sunsetting the old rewards system, and to redeem and continue earning BAT you will need to connect to a custodial account. Either Gemini or Uphold. I'll summarize below, but you can read the details here: [https://brave.com/rewards-changes/](https://brave.com/rewards-changes/)

Basically, BAT earned without a custodial account was really ""virtual BAT"" (vBAT), which isn't on the blockchain and is just a virtual reward. When you connected a custodial account, this vBAT was redeemed for BAT.

The most relevant paragraphs from the article is:

>At the *earliest,* vBAT will go away sometime in April 2023. However, we want to ensure users have time to adjust to this change, so we will share more exact dates soon.  
>  
>...Once the sunset deadline for vBAT is reached, vBAT will no longer be considered valid, and will be removed from the Brave Rewards experience. This means that even if you’re on an old version of Brave that still shows a vBAT balance, that vBAT can no longer be redeemed after the deadline. 

I haven't seen this announcement spread widely, so thought I'd give any users a heads up. 

Personally, I already had a Gemini account, so was pretty quick to redeem both my vBAT earned from the browser and from tips to my creator account. I'd guess that for many users with only a few cents or dollars in vBAT it might not be worth it to set up a custodial account."
5/3/23,Staking crypto is amazing investment strategy even if the price does not skyrocket.,"I feel like in this sub we always talk about price prediction and how different projects can make an easy 10x. And although I am pretty sure that will happen, **staking is an investment strategy** on its own and it is a great source of **passive income** and most of the time we don't even realise it.

When we talk about investment strategies, most people recommend investing in an index fund or ETF because in the long run they have always provided a good return. I am not saying that it is false but what is the purpose of it? To get a 5-7% anual return at best. I know I know, everyone will come saying that S&P 500 has had an amazing performance during the last 40 years, but here we are revolutionising the industry with cryptos.

My point here is the next one. **There are many great projects that offer a simple 5-7%** (or even much more) anual reward in exchange for contributing to the network's security. So even if the price drops a little or stays the same, I will happily keep investing for this stable return which is much better than investing in bonds or keeping the money in the bank. **I will be investing in a project I believe in and get additional rewards.**

Of course I expect my coins to increase in value as more money comes into the crypto space, but still I am very happy staking my coins and get juicy rewards, and obviously compounding it. **Even though the project does not skyrocket** like the others. :)

This is my point of view because I think we don't talk about how high the returns of staking actually are compared with other investment strategies.

Incredible documentary!

Shares the story of the Bank of Japan.

The US appointed Central Banker, Eikichi Araki, to the Bank of Japan and was tasked to rebuild the economy.

Except Araki had a personal problem:

He informed US handlers

* he's a war criminal
* was being indicted for crimes against humanity
* unable to carry out Bank functions if executed

US denied his resignation. They made him Japanese Ambassador to the US. Once the heat passed, he was sent back to the Bank.

Doc covers the history of Japan's post-war economy. It gets creepy & unsettling when it reaches the 80's. Particularly if you aren't familiar with the events that took place in Japan during that time frame and the lengthy impact.

On the other hand, there is no denying the fact that LTC has yet to live up to the price expectations set for it early on. If you had told me in 2018 5 years from now LTC would be trading under $100 I would have laughed and called you a shill but that is our reality now.

Overall, I still hold LTC on Cold wallet and wish to get a few more under $125. But what do you guys think?"

5/3/23,"In what phase do you think we are right now: “They laugh at you“, “They fight you“ or did they already “accept“ Crypto?","Probably one of the most used quotes when it comes to crypto mass adoption from the beginning to now is: “First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, they you win“ by Gandhi. He used that quote during his peaceful revolution against the british empire.

One similarity between Gandhi and crypto today is that both are peaceful “revolutions“, Crypto can be seen as a technological revolution but also a ideological revolution agains centralized entities such as banks. Here is a try to show that development in Crypto over the years:

But now the question would be where we are right now, it is usually easy to say where we once were in retro-perspective but talking about the present state is very difficult. So that is why I hope for a better discussion here about that.

If you ask me personally I would say that we pretty much still in the “They fight us“ phase even if we get so much crypto adoption news. We still do have a lot of governments spreading FUD on crypto and even trying to ban it, the US is just one example for that."
5/3/23,"There are 2 Million Fewer ETH in Circulation Today, than if the Chain Remained Proof of Work.","Since Ethereum migrated from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake, the issuance has dropped dramatically. With the on-chain activity picking up from the depths of the bear market, the burn rate is now outpacing the issuance. So since the peak supply of ~120,520,000, in-circulation coins has dropped by a bit more than 47k, leaving about 120,476,000 today.

Additionally, since POW was inflating the supply, there would be about 122,480,000 in circulation today, meaning that these moves have decreased the supply by about 2 million from where it would have been. It's been 171 days, so this is really only the beginning."

5/3/23,Q: What is the MAXIMUM percentage of your investible net worth you feel comfortable keeping in crypto?,"I know that reddit and r/CryptoCurrency tends to swing younger and poorer than other online communities but I'm genuinely curious here about how much people actually invest. I know there's always a lot of DCA and 'stack those sats' discussions when the price of crypto dips but at some people, there has to be an internal mediator that says ""I have enough (crypto) for now"".

* To make sure everyone is on the same page, I'm talking about the **max percentage** of  your **investible** **net worth** you are willing to place into **crypto**. This means all of your money in equities, bonds, cash, retirement accts, pensions, etc. and other assets but NOT including your home equity (one of the single largest stores of equity most people have but you gotta live somewhere) or depreciating assets like cars. As far as crypto is concerned, I'm talking about BTC/ETH/alts/NFTs/etc.
* To start off, I'm a big believer in the asset allocation strategy and have adhered to it for the last 20+ years. At this point, outside of one or two exceptions (say RSUs from my employer and real estate holdings),  my goal has been to keep my investments in any one investment (esp speculative ones like crypto) to <5% (often 3%).
* I could dump more money into crypto now today while  its down.. but I'd rather not just yet given the uncertainty around several big players (ahem Tether and Binance).

Q: What about the rest of you folks? Are the majority of you folks really ""I'm never going to get rich unless I YOLO everything into BTC/ETH or GME"" (an actual sentiment I read here a while ago). Or, are there some folks like me who are willing to stack BTC/ETH and maybe a few promising alts along with the rest of your portfolio?

EDIT:

To get a good idea of where the denizens of /r/cryptocurrency sit, take a look at the # of votes vs. # of moons in the poll results. Observations

\- As of 6 hours from when I started the poll, there seems to be a decent split between categories.

\- There DOES seem to be a large contingent of voters who allocate the majority of their investable net worth (it not ""all in"") into crypto.  This isn't surprising to me that they exist but (to me at least) the % still seems notable.

\- Finally, for those people who are most active on CC (aka those with the most moons), they seem to be both ""all-in"" on crypto AND have a fairly low investable net worth (at least by US financial community standards). THIS correlation doesn't seem surprising at all.

5/3/23,This is a discussion about how TA is not looking very bright to me.,"**I tried to post this under funny flairs, to not offend anyone, who is working on TA and follows TA experts, but it was removed and removed again, I don't find anything that offensive here and I think it is a total legit post, that should be in the biggest cryptocurrency community in the web space.**

**So that social engineering didn't went really well, so I will discuss this subject here, with you, guys.** ***I hope MODERATORS are not offended by such post, thank you for keeping this subreddit live, for years.***

I think TA is getting ridiculous and I see many similarities with charlatans from another **space**, pun intended.

In TA they look at the charts of how the tops and bottoms line up, RSI,  MA, what happened in the past, and they are trying to guess the future.  In Astrology they look at the stars and planets, how they line up with  each other and  what happened in the past, and they try to guess events  that would happen in the future.

[ TA chart UP, Astrology chart DOWN](https://preview.redd.it/9z5oh2asvwla1.png?width=913&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ad1bf0d7b92bbf887157b01e933de20b49e92d4e)

In TA they are using some forms and giving them names, with lines drawn  on the chart, Head and Shoulders, Triple Top, Cup with Handle and so on.  In Astrology they are drawing line on the stars and giving them names,  like Taurus, Gemini, Aquarius etc.

[ TA forms LEFT, Astrology forms RIGHT](https://preview.redd.it/ncd051eyvwla1.png?width=922&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ffe071f842589001c7ab1bc19fc8277f56369dc5)

You will find similar professionals in both areas. TA that will guide for  the right trades to become a successful millionaire. Astrology that  will tell you what you exactly need to do to achieve success in your  life. That mascaraing what they are saying like it is  true truth.

Do you guys think that this can be taken seriously? After I watched some TA experts from YouTube, I thought they were full of nonsense and I got annoyed watching them. Like it happens when I hear someone talking about astrology, like it is an exact science.

So many people become fixated on what one person at a project does that they’re missing a key point: 

If a project lives and dies based on one persons words or decisions, it was never truly decentralized or an ideal cryptocurrency. 

The entire ethos of crypto is a trustless and non-corruptable currency that can’t be manipulated or abused by one person or a small group of people with power. 

Who cares what Vitalik, Charles Hoskinson, Elon Musk, Charlie Lee, Gavin Wood, or Jed McCaleb have to say or do? If their projects live and breathe based on their words/actions alone then that’s a massive red flag."

The survey involved 300 payment leaders from around the world, who revealed that the main motivation behind their decision to adopt Bitcoin is the need for faster and more secure payment solutions. As more merchants integrate Bitcoin into their payment systems, the currency should become more widely accepted as a legitimate form of payment.

No. Some may get lucky few times, but sooner or later especially if more money gets involved you will meet an wall. This wall is called exchanges don't like losing fucking money, so they manipulate prices to make you lose everything. It is pretty common (unfortunately no common enough) knowledge and even or maybe especially biggest exchanges do that. It is easy to manipulate price if you have so much crypto as them.

Many people don't understand leverage is not about skill, it is not trading. Good traders ( maybe 1% or 2%)  have  skills to make money. It is also not like buying shitcoins, where you may have insane  luck and find coin that do x1000. Leverage is not a poker, it is like playing on slot machines.

5/3/23,Why the Bitcoin halving will play out similar to every other time.,"I have been noticing a lot of comments about the Bitcoin/Litecoin halving lately. It’s quite interesting from a psychological stand point. 

The current idea is that every 4 years we get a halving. Historically this causes Bitcoin to run. History is usually a fairly reliable indicator, but not always. 

I’m seeing a lot of posts that are saying that:

“Bitcoin always pumps during a halving, but this time it won’t. The whales will dump on us”

Now we have a real dilemma. Since the whales are going to trick us for the first time ever, we should not rely on the halving. 

Sell, sell, sell!!!

WRONG!!

This is human nature. We always think “this time is different” and we somehow manage to convince ourselves that it will actually be different. This is our fear and anxiety working against us. The big “what if”

By allowing these thoughts to take control, we set ourselves up for failure. This is a trap that we set up for ourselves that is fuelled by fear and anxiety. 

The FOMO that happens during the halving will drive the price so high that it will provide the whales with far bigger profits then if they were to just dump before the halving and take our tiny dollar cost averaged coins. 

The halving pumps are not initiated by us shrimps dollar cost averaging up to the halving event, they’re initiated by whales putting up massive buy walls, spreading massive amounts of hopium through media outlets and creating huge FOMO. 

The money that flows in is HUGE! 

The time frames or fractals might not be the same as last time, they will try to trick us, and they will shake some of us out, but you better bet on the halving still happening. It’s in the whales best interest and it’s in your best interest to bank on it happening. 

Do not give into your thoughts that “it’s not going to happen this time” 

We all know nothing is ever guaranteed in crypto or in life. 

The only thing we can rely on is that the game never changes, people never change, psychology never changes and that humans are predictable."

5/3/23,r/FortniteBR’s community points (BRICK) was just released to open market and can now be traded on RPCswap,"The ability to trade BRICK on mainnet from testnet was just allowed several days ago.  With only a $1,000,000 marketcap, I believe this native Reddit community point token has huge potential.

You can now trade all Reddit community points (tokens) including BRICK using RCPswap.com.  The current rules *do not* allow you to trade BRICK you’ve acquired in the r/fortniteBR subreddit, however as I understand it rules are voted on by the r/fortniteBR community and may be changed in the future to allow this.  You can however *trade* BRICK via the method below.

To put this into perspective, the ability to trade cryptocurrency MOONs has been available for several months now and currently has a marketcap of $20,000,000.  At the present time BRICK only has a marketcap of $1,000,000.  If BRICK ever gets to the same Marketcap as MOON, this will be a 20x return on investment, meaning a $100 investment now would be worth $2,000.  

Reddit has been aggressively expanding their community points recently, and Epic Games is constantly evolving and shows no signs of slowing down.  This to me is an incredibly bullish sign. 

The process of buying BRICK is a bit complicated, but I can break it down.  It took me several hours to figure it out, but the whole process should only take you about 10 minutes following the step by step below.  Feel free to comment with any questions.

Step 1. Download the MetaMask Wallet App. 

Step 2. Make sure you have Ethereum in your MetaMask wallet.  You can purchase this right in your MetaMask wallet with a debit card. 

Step 3.  In your MetaMask wallet browser, visit chainlist.org, scroll down and search networks for “Arbitrum Nova” then select “connect wallet”.

Step 4. In your MetaMask wallet browser, visit orbiter.finance.  “Token” at the top should be “ETH”.  “From” should be Ethereum.  “To” should be “Arbitrum Nova”.  Input the amount of Ethereum you’d like to swap and press “Send”. 

Step 5. In your MetaMask browser, visit RCPswap.com.  The top token should be “ETH” and the bottom token should be “BRICK”.  Input the amount of ETH you’d like to swap for BRICK, and press “swap”.

You now own BRICK!  Follow the same steps in reverse whenever you want to sell. 

Again, a bit complicated, but if you follow the step by step instructions you’ll see it’s pretty self explanatory.  Comment with any questions and I’ll help walk you through."

I'm curious what this community thinks about and has to say about this subject.  A lot of what crypto stands for is escaping from the control of central banks. So what would it mean if part of their backing assets are cryptocurrencies? Would it highly affect the value of the assets they currently own to back their financial strength? Would banks adopt current crypto projects like BTC, ETH, another project or maybe make their own coin? Would it be better for banks to own something they have no control over? Currently I've read in 2025 the cap will only be 2% of their holding, is that enough to make a large impact in their overall values, uses and utility in the economic ecosystem?"
5/3/23,"Selling if needed is completely fine, in fact I would recommend selling your investments once you think it has fundamentally lost its value.","It is probably very well known that the basic mentality here during this bear market was to just “HODL“, “DCA“ and basically not look at any charts to never sell as that is supposed to be the mantra that could make you very wealthy once the next bull market comes by. But it is not this easy at all.

Sometimes it is very important to pull the trigger and actually sell, not because you are too scared but simply because the reason you invested in the first place does not exist anymore. This can happen if a project just dies out during a bear market which happens often or if they get exposed as a scam, which we also saw last year happening.

Here are a few examples where selling may actually have been a very good strategy instead of just holding because you once believed in it:

There are probably a lot more examples that show this “never sell no matter what“ mantra may not be so good because sometimes it is just very good to sell and makes completely sense."
5/3/23,You need to be a multi-millionaire to simply have a chance of being a validator on Binance Smart Chain network. And it gets worse from there. [SERIOUS] ly how did we ever accept this?,"Let's look at the steps to be a validator.

1. Meet the necessary [hardware requirements](https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/validator/guideline.html#hardware). This consists of 8 cores CPU, 16GB of RAM and 500 SSD storage. This is not a cheap machine, but if you have several hundred USD lying around, it is buyable. However, some guides really recommend 32GB RAM and 1TB SSD which I tend to agree with which will cost you a fair bit more. But still doable *I guess.*
2. Run a [BSC full node](https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/validator/guideline.html#2-install-bsc-fullnode). A basic step to run some software.
3. Stake at least 10,000 BNB.

Hold on. Let's pause at step 3. Today, 10,000 BNB amounts to almost $3 Million USD. To be a validator. On BSC. First off all, you can simply be a millionaire to be a validator. You need to have several millions as you can't simply have be worth $3 Million and dump your entire net worth and be left with nothing to live on. Further, you have to account for the volatility in crypto where you could face violent swings of a few percentage points, to up to half of your stake in market losses. This *minimum* $3 Million has to be *disposable income.* Remember when we thought 32 ETH was too high? 

And then, the minimum of $3 Million only gives you a *chance* to become an elected validator. BSC has 21 elected validators. The 21 largest stakes decide the 21 stakers who will be elected validators. You have to have, at worst, the 21st largest stake every BSC candidate validator in the world. I like to compete but I don't like to enter something I know I'd lose. You'd literally be up against multi-billion dollar coorporations. Oh, because of the 21 validator limit all other delegated(non-elected) validators have to pool their funds with an actual elected validator and pay them commissions. And currently the validator with the highest voting power currently has a pool of BNB amounting to $529M.

What's worse, it's very probable that Binance is one of these validators, or at least some affiliate of Binance is. So that's at least one spot already gone, likely more more. I'll fully admit this is my speculation, but let's think realistically about this. Do you really believe Binance would relinquish control of BSC to 21 randoms?  What is insidious about that is Binance first gatekeeps validator positions by keeping the entire cost high and then gets to keep significant control of their own network that they call ""decentralised"". BEP131 has actually changed the protocol so only 19 validators are selected out of the 21 and 2 are randomly selected from the candidate validators. This just *potentially* gives Binance more power to choose any two they desire. Crypto Researcher [Wilson Withiam](https://twitter.com/WilsonWithiam/status/1381420705187831810) asserts at *least* 5-6 validators have close ties to Binance.

And we even have precedent for this. Remember the time Binance was hacked for 600M back in October? Binance quickly managed to freeze their network. CZ claimed on his Twitter that they ""asked"" validators to halt the network. Not impossible, but certainly sketchy, especially with how fast the network freeze came. Coincidentally, this hack occurred exactly a month before the FTX collapse.

Now firstly, Binance has two chains: BNB Chain(governance layer) and BSC chain(regular transaction/execution layer). Further, these are also assertions about BNB chain(not BSC) that acts as a governance layer for BSC. These state that BNB chain only has 11 validators. I've seen statements that Binance intend to improve this number to 100 but there as been no advancement yet on this proposed BEP-159. Binance has even [endorsed Twitter statements](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/blog/bnb-chain-a-decentralized-response/) that say that BNB chain has kept the some of the same validators who were individual devs present from the early days of BNB. I have been able to verify this. But statements have also been made that these 11 validators determine the 21-member validator set on BSC. I have not been able to verify this myself BUT Binance endorsed statements that did not *directly* deny the claim. The most discomforting and irritating part is that the facts about this is so hard to find to prove or disprove that it *almost* seems like the information is intentionally buried. Compared to Ethereum docs, Binance docs feels like digging for life in a graveyard. But of course, that's my opinion.

Frankly, the more I read about BNB Chain and BSC chain the more disturbed I get and we'd be going on and on. This post is long enough as it is. And I think I've said enough. Remember this is supposed to be decentralized. This is supposed to be crypto for everyone rich and poor. I don't know what this is, but this is not that.

5/3/23,What are your (non financial) crypto related goals?,"Most of us are here for the money/ financial freedom/ improving our living conditions and everyone already knows that. But now I am not talking about money, debts, homes, cars, retirement or anything like that. I ask what else  you want to achieve thanks to crypto? 

Personally for me one of my main crypto goals in networking/ socializing. In cc I  have met a lot of amazing, intelligent people from many different fields and countires and I hope most of those friendships will last and one day we will meet on party on  some private island. Thanks to them I learned a lot and hopefully one day all of us will be rich, successful and influential people. If not crypto I would never met those amazing friends, I would have to waste time on people around me in real life that have neither goals, ambition or different perspective. Irl I have friends in one age (I am uni student), from ome  country, mostly in one city, that are also quite boring.Thanks to crypto  I met people from all around the world, im different ages, from different cultures, that speak different languages, and they  are very fascinating. I learned a lot  about crypto ( and not only crypto) by just talking to them.  

My other non financial crypto related goal is not getting left behind in new technology and actually improving my tech and programming knowledge. I am not much of a tech guy, I like it but not enough  to have knowledge about any details, it never was my thing. I am uni student, so I wouldn't like to be already left behind and in 10 or 15 years become boomer that can't use any modern devices or apps. Thanks to crypto I am up with even newest tech, learn more about using apps, wallets and  general tech research. If not crypto I would probably have no idea about things like Chat GPT or AI. Crypto also gave me motivation to start learning programming. When almost everyone here have at least basic knowledge about programming and you see how  important skill it is you feel it is actually valuable thing to learn. Before being in  crypto I never felt any need to learn programming,  now with knowledge about blockchain and  crypto  I think even if it won't be  my main job it will definitely be something I will want to use.

And what are your crypto related (non fianancial) goals?"

And the 401(k) market represents literally trillions of dollars...obviously it can't be that easy, so what am I missing here?"

One major benefit i see with crypto firms being required to register with the SEC as securities and assets is added protection. Cash is an **asset** and is insured by the FDIC. If Crypto is considered a currency therefore its an asset, under law should be insured by the FDIC($250K). The other benefit is securities protection. If the SEC wants to classify crypto as securities they have to insure them as well, by law.   **SIPC covers brokerage accounts up to $500,000 in securities** **. EMPHASIS ON Securities.**

FINRA would also need to add an exam and license for registered financial advisors. Same way Insurance or stock brokers have to  get approved to sell securities. This will unlock ALOT of wealthy investors, institutional investors  and create growth in the sector. 

Most importantly people need protection. There's too many scams out there and too many people have lost money or handed it over to bad actors.

I get the whole purpose of crypto is to get away from the government but lets all be real, this will never happen in a country that has a reserve currency for the whole PLANET. There will always be a blockchain out there that is ""off the grid"" but it will never be a mainstream one."

In the discovery process we learned that her mother made a substantial crypto purchase at gate.io. Out of everything we have had to go through with this for the estate, gate.io has been the worst. They won't recognize the letter of administration nor the death certificate. They are insisting that my lady submit a birth certificate. 

The more and more I look at this, the more it seems the MIL got scammed at some point. 

Have any of you had any experience with gate.io and do you have any suggestions for us?

Edit: my lady emailed the estate attorney. The attorney requested all information she has for gate.io. The firm will handle all further communications with gate.io. 

Thanks everybody. So a little more detail, the MIL got some financial advice in late 2021 and in that advice it was suggested she invest in crypto. So she did. In January of 2022 she put a sizeable chunk of her retirement into crypto with both gate.io and Coinbase. It appears to me as though she maybe forgot about it, was holding onto it in the event of a recovery, or didn't know what to do with it and just let it there. Neither the mil or my lady were really on speaking terms when she died so neither my lady or I had any knowledge of this. 

I personally have a Coinbase account and was mining ETH with my desktop rigs for a couple years. Coinbase has been much easier to work with and we should have full access to the mil's Coinbase account within a week. At that point, any crypto that is in her wallets there will be cashed out and the money added to the estate finances. I'm assuming the worst and that the mil suffered greatly in the crash last year and what remains might be 50% of what was initially invested at most. 

Regardless, we just hope she invested the most into Coinbase and not gate.io."
5/3/23,Getting rid of bad habits in 2023,"A feasible way to be a more rational and less impulsive investor is to reflect on your behaviour, surface those bad habits and work intentionally to eliminate them. A few of such bad habits include spending time obsessively on the charts, getting addicted to leverage trading, chasing the hype on coins that turn out to be shitcoins, failing to take profits, among others. This list is certainly not exhaustive.

Now that it’s March, we have had two months to change for the better. Have you had much success in getting rid of one or two bad habits?

Increased merchant adoption and acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a form of payment

Greater education and awareness around the benefits and potential of cryptocurrencies

Regulatory clarity and a more favorable legal environment for cryptocurrency businesses and users

Enhanced security measures to protect against hacks and fraud

Collaboration and interoperability between different blockchains and cryptocurrencies to improve scalability and usability.

5/3/23,What is a MEV bot and why you should care,"**1- MEV: Maximal Extractable Value**Block producers ( validators ) have the right to order txns in a blockReordering txns can result in profit  with front running, arbitrage or sandwich attacks

Sandwich attacks are easy to understand so let me explain with an example.U place an order on Sushiswap to buy $1000 in ETH with USDC. The  price is $1500. you set a slippage tolerance of 2%, meaning you willing to pay up to $1530 per Eth .

A market actor (Bot) buy $1000 of eth at the price of $1500 before you, let him drive the price up  to your max $1530 price, and sell it back to the liquidity pool, this way it make  $20 minus gas fees in profit

The block's validator has to send the bots 2 txns directly before and directly after your 1k buy for the profit to be guaranteed, and the bot has to pay the validator for the ordering.

**2-Why MEV can be a problem?**

While arbitrage is a typical, healthy market activity, MEV bots can steal other users' opportunities by keeping an eye on the transaction mempool and replicating trades, all while paying block producers a higher fee to have their transactions included in place of the original arbitrage transaction, Users who are sandwiched face increased slippage and worse execution on their trades.

Generalized frontrunners and the gas-price auctions they frequently participate in cause network congestion and high gas prices for everyone else attempting to conduct routine transactions at the network layer. MEV can have negative impacts between blocks in addition to what occurs within those blocks. Validators may be motivated to reorg blocks in order to take the MEV for themselves if the MEV offered in a block significantly exceeds the regular block reward, leading to blockchain reorganization and unstable consensus.

We always hear about big coins and exchanges getting hacked for Eth, and BTC but never hear about shitcoins being stolen. That said...

There have been several hacks involving shitcoins. Here are the top 10 examples:

Electroneum (2018) - *a mobile shitcoin mining app that was hacked for $500,000 worth of ETN due to a vulnerability in its online wallet*

Rubycoin (2014) - *a proof-of-work shitcoin that was hacked for 300,000 RBY due to a vulnerability in its code*.

Krypton (2016) - *a shitcoin that was hacked for 21,465 KR due to a vulnerability in its smart contract*

Verge (2018) - *a privacy-focused high quality shitcoin that was hacked for 35 million XVG due to a vulnerability in its mining algorithm*

Vertcoin (2018) - *this shitcoin was hacked for $100,000 worth of VTC due to a 51% attack on its blockchain*

PolySwarm (2018) - *a decentralized antivirus shitcoin marketplace that was hacked for $500,000 worth of Nectar (NCT) due to a vulnerability in its smart contract*

Feathercoin (2013) - *another shitcoom that was hacked for 6 million FTC due to a vulnerability in its code*.

Syscoin (2018) - *a shitcoin that was hacked for $11 million worth of SYS due to a bug in its blockchain*

Bitcoin Gold (2018) - *a shit fork of Bitcoin that was hacked for $18 million worth of BTG due to a 51% attack on its blockchain*.


Last but not least...

Smartcash. I personally owned this promising shitcoin at the time.
In 2018, someone figured out how to mint millions of coins tanking the price within minutes after mass selling them on various shitcoin exchanges until the devs froze the network. This resulted in months long wait where all the holders where in limbo.  

###Honorable Mentions:

Nano(aka Raiblocks)

Although not considered a shitcoin at the time by it's die hard fans, it's pretty much a shitcoin now. With its lightening fast transaction speeds,
In 2018, Italian cryptocurrency exchange BitGrail was hacked for $170 million worth of Nano (XRB), formerly known as RaiBlocks. The exchange claimed that the hack was due to a flaw in the Nano protocol that allowed unauthorized transactions to occur. However, the Nano team disputed this claim and suggested that the hack was a result of BitGrail's poor security practices. The hack resulted in a legal battle between BitGrail and Nano, with both parties blaming each other for the incident.

EDIT:

Also see Harmony One.

From coindesk:

“The Horizon bridge incident resulted in the loss of $99,340,030.00 worth of digital assets across approximately 65,000 wallets and 14 different asset types,”"
5/3/23,How many crypto wallets do you own?,"I was reading about the Luke Dashjr BTC hack and it got me thinking if people have multiple crypto wallets and addresses.

I think having a cold wallet that isn't connected to the internet plus numerous online wallets is a precaution everyone should take.

What are the benefits:

* If you are hacked you won't lose all your crypto assets
* If you forget one private key you won't lose all your crypto assets
* Smaller transactions (since your crypto will be dispersed across many wallets) will not draw as much attention thus increasing privacy

I will be taking these steps in the next few days to give myself peace of mind.

I'm curious if others think I'm being too paranoid or have carried out some of these practices."
5/3/23,Reducing the Risk and Fear of contributing Liquidity.,"External Pool rewards in the form of MOONs have been live for the past 24 hours. Since then, the TVL (Total Value Locked) in the Liquidity Pool (LP) has increased by $20k to a total of $220k (and is increasing hourly), up from $66k one month ago. While there has been a major uptick in the amount of value and people adding to the pool, it was noted that there are still some hesitant users out there who are quite fearful of adding their precious MOONs and ETH into the pool. Their fear is warranted, as many users have been burned chasing high APRs or had their entire LP position go up in smoke when one of their tokens got rugged (anyone else LP LUNA/USDC like I did?). Furthermore, the disclaimer on every LP states that you run a “**risk of impermanent loss**”. These are heavy words, most commonly associated with negativity, but with a perspective shift, there should be less stress involved in LPing. There are ways to reduce your exposure, to help create an exit plan and to provide a better idea of what you are achieving by providing liquidity. I hope that this post calms your apprehension of contributing to an LP - not just the SushiSwap MOON/ETH LP, but any LP - as the principles below address mental obstacles rather than get into too much of the technicalities.

&#x200B;

“RISK”

Holding an investment is risky enough, but you will be adding more risk by contributing to an LP. You can primarily control this risk by calculating your personal TVL for the pool. Figuring out your personal TVL in relation to the total pool TVL will also help you to calculate what kinds of rewards you can expect from the daily SUSHI & MOON rewards that are being offered. So, how much of your holdings are you willing to put on the table? It is not recommended to put in your whole bag, though some people do. Risk is a personal issue. A prominent poster on r/cc mentioned that they owned about 8% of the MOON/ETH TVL, which, at the time of their posting, worked out to about 40k MOONs and 5 ETH of their holdings being contributed to the pool. The poster had just over 80k MOONs listed next to their username. It is uncertain how many MOONs they have stored outside their vault, however, just going by the information provided, this whale sized liquidity contributor is “risking” 40k out of their 80k MOONs in the pool – in other words 50% of their holdings. If you want to reduce your exposure to an LP, aim for a lower personal TVL (5% - 25%) so that less of your total holdings are in the pool, subject to “impermanence” and “loss”.

&#x200B;

“IMPERMANCE”

While in an LP, your pool assets are constantly adjusting, dependent on the current value of each asset. This is the impermanent state you find yourself in while your LP contribution is locked – one day you may have more MOONs and the next day you may have less. A state of **permanency** occurs before you enter the LP and after you exit. You will be locking in a set amount of an asset when entering a pool and will likely taking out a fixed, but different amount of that same asset when exiting. However, while locked in the LP, the amount of your assets will constantly be changing. The shift from impermanent to permanent happens when you withdraw your liquidity as the amount of assets you withdraw are now no longer subjected to rebalancing. The empowering factor is that YOU can decide when to make your holdings permanent. Do you see a shift in one of your assets that may cause it to lose or gain significant value? Are you happy that maybe you have a lot more MOONs in the LP now because the price went up on ETH? In the SushiSwap MOON/ETH LP you can withdraw at any time, for a minimal fee to lock in the current value of your holdings, shifting them from an impermanent to permanent state. You have the power to save the value of your holdings before they suffer any major losses.

&#x200B;

“LOSS”

What a scary word. No one wants to lose anything. But the mental trick with LPing is that for every bit of X you lose, you GAIN a bit of Y. In the example of MOON/ETH LP, when your MOON amount goes down, you are losing MOONs but gaining ETH. Conversely, when your MOON amount goes up, you are gaining MOONs, but losing ETH. The LP maintains balance for you. Now, the matter to address is not solely based on the amount of the each of your holdings in the pool but the value of them. As I will touch on later in this post, if you are comfortable holding either of your pool assets outside a LP then you should be similarly comfortable with holding them in an LP. To use the term DCA slightly incorrectly, but I hope you get the point: what the LP is doing is DCAing in or out of one asset to the other. If, for example, the price of MOONs rise relative to ETH, then all the LP is doing is DCAing out of MOONs and DCAing into ETH. This is a tactic that many are considering when the next bull run comes – to slowly sell some of their assets as the price rises. You may be subject to a loss in value of your assets compared to if you just held them (e.g the price of MOONs went up but now have less of them) but you also gained more of an arguably stronger asset (ETH).  What others may see as a drawback, I see as a benefit.

&#x200B;

DON’T SET IT AND FORGET IT

I track all my holdings and positions in Excel, which I update weekly (you’ll drive yourself insane updating any more frequently than daily). Below is my LP position in the SushiSwap MOON/ETH LP (not my true position, I have used a multiplier so that my true holdings cannot be calculated. The information is accurate, but only a representation).

&#x200B;

[\*Asset prices on my excel spreadsheet are updated every half hour. True prices in the LP position are updated much more frequently, hence the slight imbalance in values shown in the table.](https://preview.redd.it/sixrub5r0yla1.png?width=659&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5d061e68b8da6ec20eec91b1e4bbc2963ba8ac4b)

(1) Here I calculate and manage my “RISK” or the percentage of my holdings of each asset that I am holding in the LP. Here, I am operating at a low risk on MOONs (14.8% of my total MOONs are in the pool) and a very low risk on ETH (only 2% of my total ETH is in the pool). If I earn more MOONs this month and don’t add anymore to my LP position, then my percentage of MOONs risked goes down. If I sell MOONs this month, then my percentage of MOONs risked would go up. Even if MOONs moon, most of my holdings are outside the pool so my total MOON value should not be greatly affected.

(2) This how much of each asset I have contributed to the pool and how much the value of each of those assets would be if I simply held them. I add to the Entry figures whenever I contribute more assets to the pool. This helps me track how much I have gained or lost in value and in holdings by staying in the LP.

(3) You may think, “holy shit OP, you lost $18 worth of MOONs from sitting in the pool?”. If I simply held, yes, but remember the LP has been balancing or DCAing in and out of my assets on my behalf. My current holdings look slightly different to when I entered but if you add up the value its just about the same. ETH was around $1600 - $1620 and MOONs around $0.1550 - $0.1700 when I entered the pool, so while the prices and amount of each of my assets have changed, the value of them have not changed by much.

(4) In fact you can see that I gained 6.6% more ETH but lost 5.7% of my MOONs

(5) And to put that in a Profit or Loss perspective, I have gained about $0.45, some of which can also be attributed to fee rewards from people using the pool assets to swap on SushiSwap. So, tell me, in this example and at this moment, what have I really “lost” or “gained” anything?

(6) Here I add in my external pool rewards. These pool rewards are *supposed* to compensate for the possible loses that you suffer from contributing to the LP. In this case, I have added about $0.33 to my portfolio in the form of external rewards.

(7) Call the Lamborghini dealership, I have earned a whopping $0.75 from holding my LP position over the last few weeks!

&#x200B;

SACRIFICE

“OP, what's the point? You made all of $0.75 for all that effort?”. What did I really do? Press a few buttons and update my spreadsheet once a week? There is not really a lot of work or time involved in LPing and the longer I stay in a pool, the more rewards I accrue. The big rewards go to those who risk more of their personal TVL and who own more of the pool TVL, but I stay cautious, and I am happy with the small passive income it provides. On the flipside, if things were to go to shit, my losses would be minimal, but those putting forward a huge risk would suffer huge losses. It can be argued that any sacrifice you make in life benefits you or those you are closest to in some way. In this case I am risking some of my holdings as a sacrifice to the greater good of deepening MOON liquidity, which should in turn improve price stability, making it easier for investors and banner advertisers to buy MOONs without creating huge swings in the price. Theoretically and idealistically, the easier an asset is to buy, the more people can buy it, the higher the price goes and the greener my portfolio becomes. In the example table above, I am part of the TVL, just under 0.2% in fact, and my small contribution matters to the grand scheme of making MOONs value appreciate.

&#x200B;

TRUST

Faith would be a poor word for this section. That would be placing your money and time in something that you cannot see or that is not quantifiable. When LPing, or investing for that matter, you are placing your trust in the team and other holders behind the asset. Again, this is a question not only for MOONs but any asset you LP for: do you trust that what you are holding will provide value and utility in the years to come? One reason I earn and buy MOONs is because the sentiment of its holders can be seen right here on r/cc. I don’t have to follow anyone on Twitter or join any Discord channel. If there is upheaval I can read about it here, or if there are any beneficial changes planned, I’ll probably buy a little more. If you choose to LP for any pair of assets, you are saying: “I trust in what I am holding to the point where I am willing to risk some of my holdings by contributing liquidity, so that others may have better access to the asset that I am putting my trust in.”

&#x200B;

In closing, I cannot stress enough that I am not trying to say there are no risks to LPing. That would be dangerous. I’m just saying that, despite the risks, there may be financial and social benefits to be discovered by LPing. Contributing liquidity that just might make you satisfied that you decided to test the waters and come for a swim.

&#x200B;

TLDR: If you are apprehensive about providing liquidity, maybe you just need a slight perspective shift to contribute to the strength of  your assets."
5/3/23,Income generation without the effort - how passive income can help you build more wealth,"Passive income is defined as income generated from any source that requires minimal labour or no labour at all to yield. For some, this may sound like their day job, but it is obviously not a ""normal"" job where you spend a lot of time and effort to generate the income.

You could say that investments in general are aimed at generating passive income. You put in effort once (or a series of times when applying for example DCA) and you wait for your capital to grow. There are however other factors to consider to build passive income.

&#x200B;

**""Regular""passive income**

Besides cryptocurrency, in ""regular"" investing there are things like interest on loans you lend; rent you earn from renting your possessions (e.g. house, car); dividends you earn from investing in stocks and ETFs; income you generate by advertising on your webpage, etc. All of these are aimed at increasing your passive income.

&#x200B;

**Cryptocurrency passive income**

In cryptocurrency you have several ways to earn passive income:

1. **Mining** (using your computer to validate blockchain transactions and be rewarded in return)
2. **Staking** (committing to your holdings and letting them be used to validate transactions and support the respective blockchain)
3. **Yield farming / liquidity staking** (lending your crypto to others and be returned ""interest"" on your assets)
4. **Play to earn** (play games to earn cryptocurrency, strictly speaking this isnt passive but it could be fun)
5. **Shitpost to earn** (Can't factor out being active on this subreddit, even though it does require effort)

The last would be the regular investing and HODLing. Waiting for your portfolio's value to increase. But this does not really qualify in my eyes.

Some forms of passive income will also yield compounded returns. These are beautiful as it will yield more gains over time. As I tried to visualize below:

&#x200B;

[Compounded versus regular returns](https://preview.redd.it/j0toc0njovla1.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=39d87da0194ec53ba63e09ce9c5d5f8314b6ef69)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Why would you bother?**

In my opinion, a key methodology to live a financially carefree life is to let your money work for you. Generating as much passive income as you can will make your active income dependency less big. And the less dependent you are, the more time you have available to enjoy life. And is that not what life is essentially for?

The goal should be to change the balance of active and passive income to your favor. As the more passive income you generate, the more time you have potentially available for fun.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[The balance of passive versus active income](https://preview.redd.it/5ry3aguoqvla1.png?width=1207&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b4a23fc8aba1be891f4e2a2c0747604ec7a7f5b2)

Generally, if you would focus on generating passive income, you are not focusing on becoming so rich that you never have to work again. As this is something you think you want, but at first is very hard to attain and in second place will probably not yield the kind of happiness you think.

Are you, and if so how, generating passive income?"

5/3/23,THE PEOPLE OF PAGE 9 (Part 2) Haber & Stornetta,"# HABER & STORNETTA

Crypto's oldest & most enduring blockchain is **Surety.** 

It's okay to express confusion. Few in the space know this. When Bitcoin fired up, Surety had been stamping hash values for 13 years. It still runs today.

The technology that powers Surety was designed by the inventors of blockchain, Stuart Haber & Scott Stornetta.

Their work underpins the entire crypto space. Of the eight citations contained on page nine of the Bitcoin White Paper, three belong to them.

https://preview.redd.it/qkgcx0ofwyla1.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e5411d5c1b2bac336b9342018d01ba429143dda1

[Longest active blockchain](https://preview.redd.it/ckoj6olvuyla1.png?width=652&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=953610f2ccce12d181afaff021f13ada7f2b43ce)

David Chaum was first to propose a blockchain-like protocol in 1982.

Haber & Stornetta's 1991 design promised IRL functionality. 

The challenge at the time was:

* tamper-proof timestamps
* efficient digital document handling

They proposed Merkle trees to solve both problems.

[Merkle Tree \(binary hash tree\): 00 & 01 are hash values for L1 & L2 blocks.  Hash 0 is the hash of the sequence of hashes 00 & 01. ](https://preview.redd.it/9cy9kjg5bzla1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8ff75afa3717efc8e277fe6612af029b36c13513)

Hash trees create efficient & secure data blocks. And this design labels a cryptographic hash w/labels of its child nodes. This allows for same level of successive accuracy even with large chain structures. 

Successive blocks form a growing chain record of completed transactions. The unbroken chain serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed while also conferring integrity to the system.

They proved their concept by founding Surety Technologies in 1994 and deployed their blockchain a year later. 

[28 year old blockchain](https://preview.redd.it/4dlk5j3ggzla1.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4d8aac868b098a3b7890c6dd4e52737be41d6f4b)

Satoshi referenced Haber & Stornetta three times on page 9.  Their work is neatly woven into the:

* Design
* Efficiency &
* Security

components that make up the Bitcoin blockchain.

**SATOSHI'S DESIGN**

Satoshi's enhancements created breakthrough-level results. He decentralized the existing design, applied Adam Back's Hashcash proof of work, and introduced difficulty parameters for block stabilization.

Those are foreign concepts to most people. What matters is the new system those decades of effort have produced.

When you send $BTC, you create dual signatures that:

1. Attest to the prior transaction's authenticity
2. Sign your payee's public key

Signatures are added, the transaction is finalized, & chain integrity preserved. All done permissionlessly.

5/3/23,Understanding leverage trading," 

To start off let me first explain the two broad categories of leverage trading. I’ll be using DeFi in my examples since it allows clear separation between involved parties.

* “Dual counterparty” AAVE + Uniswap

This model is very simple, you borrow money from AAVE and you’ll pay some amount of interest to them for as long as you hold the borrowed assets. After borrowing you’ll take those assets to the market, Uniswap, execute your trades and pay a fee to Uniswap for enabling you to do so. In this example neither AAVE nor Uniswap care in the slightest if your trades are profitable or not. They simply collect their fees along the way. Uniswap LP’s as “the market” are your liquidy and as such are taking the other side of your bet.

* “Single counterparty” GMX

DEX like GMX combines these two functions. In a way you can think of it as them streamlining the above process. VERY importantly though this also combines the risk factors. You’re no longer just a lender or just a LP, you’re both. So you gain the benefit of AAVE’s interest, but also bear the responsibility of Uniswap’s LPs. This of course means that while you are gaining high interest as a lender on the platform you can also lose significant portions of your crypto if the traders on the platform go on a winning spree.

Let’s be clear, neither of these systems is bad or malicious. Assuming each of these services are honest and clear about their rules and fees I don’t think it’s appropriate to call leverage trading “rigged” like some have in another thread.  They are providing you the trader a service and thus should obviously be paid something for it.

I would however like to say something about GMX type service. I’ve recently started to see the term “RealYield” used as part of other protocols integrating into the GMX ecosystem. While the yield you can earn as a GLP holder is very real, the risk profile is much closer to “impermanent loss” than for example interest paid on the assets you have in AAVE. There’s nothing wrong with people choosing to take that risk though, as long as they understand that it exists.

Bit of a story time for the end. I used to work as a blackjack dealer and almost every night people would jokingly ask what I would do if they counted cards. My answer was always the same:”Nothing”. Because simply by them asking the question I knew they didn’t know how to do it. The tables I worked were in nightclubs and used a ruleset that favored the house even more than typical, to the extent of it being roughly 60%-40%. We also had very low max bet limits ( 10-20e ), have you ever wondered why would a gambling establishment limit your bet size? It’s not so that you lose money slower, it’s to protect the house during streaks of bad luck. In the few hundred nights I worked there was exactly one time when at the end of the night the house was at negative balance. This is a tale of tail risk, even the unlikely will happen once in a while. As such sooner or later service like GMX will lose a lot of their LP’s crypto. Not to a hack, but simply because that’s the game they are playing."

5/3/23,Silvergate closes SEN after Moody's downgrades its rating for the second time.,"**Silvergate Capital has closed its Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) due to risk concerns after credit rating agency Moody's downgraded its rating for the second time.**

The company stated that its deposit services will operate until the end of March 3, 2023.

# The risk of Silvergate is increasing due to the rating downgrade by Moody's agency and legal disputes.

Moody's lowered Silvergate's deposit rating from Ba3 to Caa1 after the company delayed filing its annual report with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The cryptocurrency-friendly bank recently sold security at significant losses to raise cash after several key partners, including US exchange Coinbase and cryptocurrency financial services firm Galaxy Digital, terminated their partnerships.

Moody's now claims that the firm is likely to experience a deposit decline that will force it to sell more securities.

Silvergate's shares fell to a record low of below $6 after markets closed on March 2, 2023. The following morning, in pre-market trading, they fell by an additional 2%. Currently, the stock price is $5.76, which represents a nearly 67% decline since the beginning of the year.

&#x200B;

Silvergate is also under scrutiny for allegedly failing to conduct due diligence on the bankrupt Bahamian exchange FTX. It was accused of assisting in the misappropriation of client funds through a Silvergate account operated by FTX-affiliated Alameda Research.

Separately, the company was sued in a class-action lawsuit filed in the Southern District of California in January 2023 for laundering $425m by southern Americans linked to drug smuggling and trafficking.

Silvergate was one of the first US banks to receive Federal Reserve approval to provide banking services to cryptocurrency firms. Initially, it was aimed at cryptocurrency traders who needed access to banking services on weekends. The now-defunct Silvergate Exchange Network allowed traders to transfer US dollars between their bank accounts and exchanges, provided that the exchange and the trader had accounts with Silvergate.

# Banks that could benefit when stablecoin issuers abandon Silvergate

In light of SEN's closure, cryptocurrency firms will need to find banking partners willing to serve cryptocurrency investors outside traditional banking hours.

Gemini Trust Co. and Tether, issuers of stablecoins GUSD and USDT, have stated that they have no significant ties to Silvergate.

USDC issuer Circle announced on Thursday that it would move some of the assets supporting its stablecoins to ""other banking partners"", of which there are still several.

New York's Signature Bank offers institutions access to the 24/7 payment network Signet through application programming interfaces that the firm can integrate into its own platform. After ending its relationship with Silvergate, Coinbase selected Signature Bank for its Prime product customers. The exchange began working with Signature in October 2022.

Customers Bank, headquartered in West Reading, Pennsylvania, offers a real-time payment service using blockchain technology called TassatPay. The private network uses the CBIT token to represent dollar deposits for B2B transaction settlements.

The cryptocurrency over-the-counter trading system, BlockFills, uses TassatPay to exchange tokens in U.S. dollars with other CBIT clients. Cryptocurrency broker, Genesis, whose lending arm recently filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11, is reportedly also a client of Customers Bank.

BlockFills, who describe themselves as an enthusiastic user of the SEN network, has not disclosed whether they will end their partnership with Silvergate."

5/3/23,Diffusions of Innovations Theory and Crypto,"The diffusion of innovations theory has been around since the early 1900s, and most of not all new technologies or products in existence have followed a similar path to widespread adoption.

The five stages being:

Innovators - people like Satoshi, Vitalik, those who bought btc at dollars per or less.  Without their amazing visions, dreams and push, none of this would be here and none of this would exist.  

Some people saw what was happening, believed in the dream, and now we have:

Early Adopters -  I believe this is where we are in the process.  A lot of us believe in the changes that crypto represents, what is has the potential to do, and the possibility to change not only our lives, but the world.  A steady growth of new people as us early
Adopters learn breathe and sing crypto.  Small projects or use cases develop in nfts or new coins which draw in more and more people 

The ultimate drive being to the 25-30% mark where we hit:

Early Majority— Mom, Dad, your neighbor Joe..  the real world use and benefits for crypto are developing.  More and more business and corporations are getting on board, accepting crytpo as payments.  More countries may be investing.   This is the push from 25-30% of population to 50-60 plus % of people using crypto.

Once we clear this

Late Majority-  this is the crowd that believe in conspiracy theories, but is now seeing crypto accepted everywhere, for everything.   Everyone is using it so why not.

The last stage being the laggards.  I suspect if this were to happen now, it would be older seniors that would be in this group, but with the current demographics that will soon be that age group, the late majority may simply not occur in Crypto.  This group is adverse to change and risk at the best of times.


And when this happens, who knows,  will it only be btc and eth forever?  Who knows.  Imo I think Bitcoin will be a gold like value store and eth will be the basis for the future crypto currency framework of programs and payment systems.  

I also do think we will see numerous new projects and that one or more of those projects, which I do not think we have even seen or heard of yet will become one of the tops and mainly used.  The possibilities are still endless as to how or where this could end up!

It’s hard to not to see Crypto following this path, even if somewhat slow or disjointed.

I don’t think we have seen anything yet!"

Founded in 2017, **Solana** is a layer one chain, offering the foundational structure of a blockchain network, which other (layer 2) networks can build on.

Similar to the Solana blockchain, Matic came into play to tackle Ethereum’s scalability issueIn terms of transaction speed, **Polygon has an upper hand over Solana**. The network is a definite victor for both developers and users, with the ability to process approximately 65,000 transactions per second. Both Solana and MATIC have the same peak transactions per second at 65,000. But Solana is ahead in one aspect – block time. This is the amount of time it takes to finalise a block and add it to the blockchain. Solana has a block time of just 400 milliseconds while Polygon takes 2.2 seconds per block.

Solana and Polygon have similar tokenomics to most Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains. In terms of costs (or Solana vs. Polygon gas fees), Solana offers lower costs. However, to secure the network, Solana and Polygon need to pay out inflationary rewards to incentivize stakers to validate the network.

Solana and Polygon (Matic) are integrated with OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace. However, Solana was ahead of Matic since it has offered NFT minting since January 2021, with 5 million NFTs

What's better in terms?

Polygon (MATIC) is a better blockchain than Solana based on network adoption, monthly active users and overall scalability. Solana has had several hacks, periods of network downtime and other adverse events that make it a relatively insecure chain compared to Polygon network

But it's primarily NFTs.

This made me have a flashback to spring 2021, May to be exact.

So back then, I bought a shitcoin on Uniswap looking for a quick buck and moonshot potential. Judge me, I don't care, we've all been there (and you know it). 200 dolaroos, nothing big. I wait a few weeks and see the shitcoin pump. 4x in total. I can't believe my luck. I now have $800 ($600 profit minus fees) in that token and I want to sell it all. I go to uniswap to make a sell order, and I see that gas fees are insance. I go to the gas tracker site at etherscan and I see it stopped counting at 1000. Why? Because it can't go over 1000 on that site. In reality, it was closer to 2000.

Take a wild guess on who is the biggest user. Yup, it's OpenSea at a cool 40-50%.

&#x200B;

OK, OK, we don't know what 2000 gwei is, [u/giddyup281](https://www.reddit.com/u/giddyup281/). Tell us the numbers in freedom money.

Gwei is 0.00000000114 ETH. 21k units for a simple send transaction. Gwei to ETh ratio X 2000 gwei X 21k units X $4k (ETH price at May 2021) is a bit less than $200.

A simple ETH send transaction was around $200. Just to send ETH from one address to another. Uniswap (simple) swap is at least $700. So if I try to sell (remember, transactions can fail), I'm actually at a loss of $100. If transaction fails, I'm at a loss of even more dolaroos.

Remember this, people. ETH does not scale, and this is especially visible in a bull market. New projects that use a lot of ETH will make the next bull run hell for ETH transactions. The network is sometimes (or most of the time) completely congested. Even if you decide it's worth it to you, transactions can fail. Beware.

TL; DR: Bull market = lots of ETH activity = gas fees are insane. $200 for an ETH send tx."

Overall the UI is pretty simple and easy to understand, you get prompts and info to explain what everything is which should be helpful for people new to crypto.

basic chart, settings and history for each individual token.

If you decide to use this wallet be careful transferring your NFTs to it since it doesn't give you an option to send out of the wallet.

you can view them fine but no way to transfer back out.

5/3/23,Tales of ETH Denver,"Most surreal thing just happened this weekend in ETH Denver.

Let’s start that Im here for work. Im in a side event networking and this guy tells me I need to meet his friend who might be interested in the product we provide.

Turns out his friend is my ex. Thats awkward but hey, we left things in good ways so we think it’s just funny. She tells me to meet her partner (both in her project and dating). This is when the most surreal thing happens, her partner is also my ex. 

I just wanted to disappear but at the same time it left me wondering if they both started dating girls because the experience with me was so bad they didnt want to repeat it or if it was so good that they thought no other guy can improve it. 

Anyways, had to share it somewhere. I still cant believe it but makes for a good Denver story."

Currently it is only available for android phones and is in its early stages of development, but I will be definetaly be keeping an eye out for this to see where it goes.

Tbh I don't really fancy their marketing terms(""Super Fast Browser, Fastest Web3 Browser), but other than that I didn't notice anything alarming about the project. They have ex. Google and Mozilla developers according to their about page. Carbon will also have a similar browse to earn experience like Brave with a token called csix. They will have an ad marketplace similar to goole ads.

[Carbon](https://preview.redd.it/t9x4fk9a10ma1.jpg?width=921&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e494b5ef12669bca6f5f9ecc77e08ea73cde75e3)

What really caught my eye is the following tab(which currently doesn't work), if I understand correctly you will be able to use csix tokens for amazon, uber, google play, etc. I don't know how this will work and couldn't find anything about it, but it will be intersting to see what they plan to do with this as well.

I personally won't be switching my primary Browser from Brave for a while at least until they further improve on some stuff and it is more stable, but I'm happy to see that Brave won't be the only web3 Browser. If anyone has tried it and has more insight I would like to hear it!

Here are some important events in the world of cryptocurrency that have occurred on March 5:

1. In 2014, the first Bitcoin ATM was installed in a coffee shop in Vancouver, Canada. The ATM was manufactured by Robocoin, a Las Vegas-based company.
2. In 2015, the United States Marshals Service auctioned off 50,000 bitcoins seized from Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the Silk Road darknet marketplace. The bitcoins were sold in 20 blocks of 2,500 bitcoins each.
3. In 2018, Google announced that it was banning all cryptocurrency-related advertisements on its platform, including ads for initial coin offerings (ICOs), exchanges, wallets, and trading advice.
4. In 2020, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged the founder of Dropil, a cryptocurrency investment platform, with fraud for allegedly lying to investors about the company's performance and misappropriating investor funds.

These are just a few notable events that have taken place on March 5 in the cryptocurrency industry."

5/3/23,Ethereum's Application-Layer Privacy Goal: Anonymity for Small Transactions - Vitalik Buterin,
5/3/23,"I saw crypto.com’s ads on UFC 285, where do they get this capital for advertising? Why don’t other exchanges do it? Red flag?","I’m not sure I’ve ever seen an ad for Binance or Gemini, I’ve seen a couple small ads for Coinbase on YouTube but crypto.com hits it out of the park. 

Crypto Arena
The Infamous “fortune favor the brave” ad with Matt Damon
Their name and logo on every fight and all over the cage in the UFC

Is it a red flag they have so much cash for all this expensive advertising? Especially during a bear market when money is much tighter it could be a sign they are pulling funds from places it shouldn’t come from. Otherwise all exchanges would have this money to throw around. Like the Winklevoss twins who own gemini could fund stuff like that but don’t. I’ve never seen an ad on the scale of either of those 3 crypto.com ads but for another exchange.

If they have business loans for advertising that’s still a huge liability for users of the platform. The staples center name change alone to crypto arena was a $700 million dollar deal. 

The only way they make money is “via debit card interchange fees and maker-taker fees that it collects for matching buyers with sellers. Crypto.com also collects loan interest and charges two different sales fees in its NFT marketplace.” And most likely private equity investment. 

It just seems like they are spending to much for this to be sustainable or to have a good outcome what do you think?"
5/3/23,Egypt Arrests 29 Over Alleged Online Crypto Scam,
5/3/23,Crypto Daydreams,"
I'll try to keep this short and as informative as possible. I'm not a psychologist in any way, so there were a lot of stuff that flew over my head, here's what I understood and how I managed it.

Who among us has never wondered about what might have been, had you invested in some coin which was dirt cheap and 100x within a few months or a few weeks or even a few days?  Thinking about what might have been, about alternatives to our own pasts, is central to human thinking and emotion. 

The moment, I've began investing in Crypto, these thoughts have multiplied exponentially like some virus. Mostly because of the insane gains (not as much currently lol) we get to see in the market unlike the traditional Stock market. The ' If only ' virus, is prevalent in many aspects of our normal lives, but when it comes to Crypto, it's a whole another beast.
For me personally, the day dreaming increased way high, I've caught myself multiple times drifting apart thinking about Gains in the last bullrun, and now thinking why I didn't take profits in the same run so i could have exponentially increase the portfolio I have now. 
 
Counterfactual thoughts are often alternatives that are in some tangible way better or worse than actuality. Better alternatives are termed upward counterfactuals and worse alternatives are termed downward counterfactuals. When upward counterfactuals focus on personal choice, the resulting emotion is termed regret. This is the one, I and many others like me suffer from. 
There are many theories regarding this, but it's too complicated for me.
The most famous example of this is, the Olympic medalists, it appears the Bronze medallists are happier than the Silver medallists because they're just glad they could get Bronze and the other regrets not achieving Gold, the ' if only ' kicks in and the regret seeps in. 
I overcame this by learning how my brain tricks me and feeds me fake scenarios just because I didn't get rich like some who got rich either by dumb luck (mostly) or by smart trades. Or by someone who sold right at the top. You can never time the top, trust me, I thought it'll just keep going up. When I saw clearly, that maybe I just have to think of myself as a Bronze medallist, who's ahead of millions of people who don't even know what Cryptocurrency's are, helped me to cut down on the regret. It's something that helped for me.

Now that the market is on crab mode, we should focus on just how much we can DCA and prepare for the next bull run. Don't try to find the next shitcoin which will pump like crazy next. 
By the next bull run, we'll all be Gold medalists, if you take profits that is, or Hodl, whatever makes you happy.

TLDR; Guy 1: Oh no I think a lot about what could've been, i should've sold at the top, i should've bought *that* coin, so many regrets, i could've made lot of money.

Guy 2: shut the hell up, it's okay, we're not near a bull market now, stop cribbing and DCA, learn from your mistake, take profits next time. 

Have a nice day guys. Peace out."

5/3/23,My unfortunate timing,"I have been investing for a few years now and I have been in crypto since early 2021 so I had an opportunity to catch a solid pump on entry. But due to where I was in life I had to save money for upcoming events and was only able to invest small amounts. 

This period lasted until about May of 2021 but I was hesitant and still wanted to keep crypto below 10% of my total portfolio. Regardless, I did begin DCA into the market again with a much larger amount in my slightly green portfolio. 

This continued until about 4 months ago where I am again in a situation where I need to save as much as I can. So I am only able to add small amounts. 

I also got into NFTs obviously… I’m only down 30% thanks to these avatars (mostly the WSB drop). Was down real bad before.

But I’ve never sold. And I’m still buying, I’m a little addicted to Avatars. 

I will admit that there was some hesitation during the last downturn as I was still new to crypto and it was an aggressive drop. But now I am putting everything I can afford to add, it’s just so much less than I’d like to.. hopefully the bear market will last a little longer. 

**TLDR: due to my financial situations I was only able to contribute to my portfolio during highs and pumps. While during recent bear markets and downturns I can hardly afford to add anything.**"

3 chains plus it is said that it would take more than a %51 percent attack to overtake the network. I know of bridge risks so I try not to hold bridged assets.  

I recently found arbitrum and I do not know much about it, aside from it being spam posted about all over… which I do not think is they’re fault (arbitrum). 

The other day I sent some Eth from either polygon or Avax over to arb and I deposited it on aave. 

So I figured out Eth is the gas token and It seems to function the same from the front end, but I’m posting this because of a misconception I made about Avax when I started using jt. 

At first I thought Avax was an L2 of Eth, which I soon learned I was wrong about. Yes dumb assumption but a lesson learned. 
So I’m looking for some similarities and differences between Polygon and Arb.
Also How secure is arb comparatively and what are some risks?

And what about Curve? anyone been using?

Feeback about both cards, would be really aprecciated, i want to use these cards for the daily purchases, mostly for groceries, and probably for some online purchases.

Regarding the perks, probably would only use 1 for the supermarket groceries and some online purchases mostly at aliexpress, as the tv cable provider offered me hbo max and amazon prime for 2 years, so i dont pay any streaming subscriptions for now.

Can Plutus rewards be stored at a Ledger hw?

I know this is an extreme price prediction but even 10x from now would still be fairly high

&#x200B;

I'm currently working on blockchain development in my current company along with normal Software development related chores, and I have to say, getting to work on things you love and have keen interest in, is the best thing.

&#x200B;

So, talking about jobs in this industry, according to this  [report by PwC](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/technology/publications/blockchain-report-transform-business-economy.html) , Blockchain will add/enhance more than 40 million jobs by 2030, which is very huge in itself.

&#x200B;

Let's talk about the current job market, Blockchain developer  job has seen one of the highest % of job growth in recent years. Worldwide yearly growth in blockchain job postings was around 300% in 2021. Which is nuts! And getting ahead with blockchain knowledge in its early years will help you so so much.  


[This is the US average salaries for Blockchain developers currently](https://preview.redd.it/cczvpgpojula1.png?width=1282&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8261d1175af3dde08d8a4a2397e59b01cc92b38d)

This is more than considerably greater than the Software developer salaries

So what do you need to get started?  


If you're an existing developer, I recommend you to start with Ethereum/ Solidity development.

There are lots of beginner friendly courses on Coursera, Udemy etc. Which, with the right knowledge, you can get em for free. (I recommend you buying them though).

I loved this particular course myself [https://www.udemy.com/course/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/](https://www.udemy.com/course/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/)

&#x200B;

This was a little fast paced, but since I'm a developer, it was all good.

5/3/23,Is there a possibility for ADA Cardano to die eventually?,"ADA was launched in September 2017 and managed to survive and thrive in the last Bullrun. It publicly launched with a price of 0,02 and had an all-time high of 3.1 USD. it has been a top dog and managed to keep a top 10 position for years. 

But lately, Polygon CEO Sandeep Nailwal has claimed that Ethereum’s rival Layer 1 protocols, like Cardano (ADA), will not be able to survive for long. He said that the lack of Layer 2 upgrades on Cardano (ADA) would make the platform suffer. Cardano (ADA) has also suffered from the negative market sentiments arising out of the ongoing Ripple-SEC lawsuit. Subsequently, the growth trajectory of Cardano (ADA) has been downward in recent weeks. 

Of course, there might be reasons behind his statements that we don't know or take into consideration.

I  personally believe Cardano will not fail and just fade slowly but hey I guess you never know.

What are your thoughts on this, is Polgons CEO right or wrong, or maybe is an intended ""attack"" or something else?"

5/3/23,How do you cope up with the high level of crabbing in price action.,"January 2023 was a great month. Bitcoin exhibited what it is known for high momentum and volatility. The large caps crypto moved up atleast 50% to 70%. In actual terms the price of Bitcoin moved up from 16.6k to 24.6k. A phenomenal 50% up in a span of 14 days or lesser.
Etherum price in January shot up from 1150 to 1660 atleast 50% to 70% depending upon where you consider the bottom


But since Mid January 2023 Bitcoin has been crabbing at 22k to 25k price. Even though this is a better range compared to 16k to 18k.

But the price range has narrowed down. The technical experts may call it ascending triangle with upside breakout possible. 

All we see is a major crabbing market. The crabbing market is very frustrating as the prices isn't moving in the either side. A friend of mine has got so frustrated he deleted all apps despite having a strong exposure.

So I want to you know how do you guys cope up with this crabbing market where the Crypto behaves like a stablecoin for extended period of time"

5/3/23,Why CBDC will be good for crypto but bad for everyone,"Moon farmers, read before commenting, I'm not saying CBDC are good, they are bad for everyone, people, investors etc. The only reason it will pump crypto is the following:

 

Back in 1987, the stock market had a big drop that became known as ""Black Monday"". To prevent extreme market volatility like this, regulators introduced something called a ""circuit breaker"". This means that if things get too crazy in the stock market, trading can be paused so everyone can calm down.

Fast forward to 2021, and some retail investors learned that hedge funds were trying to make money by betting that certain stocks, like Gamestop, would go down in value. The retail investors decided to turn the tables and force the hedge funds to buy back the stocks they were shorting, which made them lose money. As a result, Robinhood, a popular investment app, had to restrict the trading of these stocks.

Imagine 2025, many governments will have introduced digital currencies that all assets will be traded against. However, this means that if something really bad happens and the market gets too crazy, trading can be stopped altogether. This has led to concerns about how much diversity you really have if all your investments are tied to a currency that can be controlled and frozen by the government. Some people believe that even the worst cryptocurrencies are more valuable than the best stocks because they can always be traded or transferred without the government getting in the way.

 So, the question is, how diversified are you if all your assets trade against a dystopian, government-controlled currency that can be frozen at any time? The answer is, you aren't. Your wealth is useless if it can be confiscated at any time. This is where cryptocurrencies come in handy. Even the worst-performing cryptocurrency is more valuable than the most valuable stock. This is because, no matter what happens, you can always trade it on a decentralized exchange (DEX) or transfer it to anyone, anywhere, anytime."

In terms of defense? Best I see is defeatist ""well we can't stop it"". Horseshit. Getting your crypto off exchanges is a great start. 

What should be the greatest point of contention is what crypto should we buy to spend. For example dogecoin, shib, XLM, Ada, I dunno. We should be looking for ways to spend it and get more normies involved. 

All of these Statist and collectivist types should be ran out of the space in terms of influence.

Well after many hours of thinking, and decision making, I decided to not only buy ETH and BTC, but also buy Alts. 

But this is very strict, I will buy 40% BTC, 40% ETH, and 20% Alts, but only avax, xrp, doge, matic, atom. And possibly recommended coins in the comments.

Why did I change my mind, because of the comment section of the first post. 

A lot of people made a good point, the ATH of avax, and atom, and matic are huge multiplied compared to BTC and ETH.

5/3/23,Reddit CEOs are geniuses when it comes to innovation with Crypto.,"Reddit has introduced a community points program that allows subreddits to have their own cryptocurrency.
Although there is a wait-list, it has the potential to create a self-engaging system where subreddit's can inter-trade their points with each other. 

*This concept is not new and was previously seen in online text-based games in the mid-2000s, where cross-game trading was possible, albeit tedious and violating TOS standards*.

In this system, a person wanting moons can rid his xCoins from r/Xgame to someone who needs the xCoins but has some moons. 

###Another one is NFTs.

There may be a shit ton of shit NFTs out there, but they aren't going away. People want them either out of obsession or regular enjoyment. This increases the demand for crypto from subreddits, making inter-trading between subreddits and NFTs beneficial for Reddit. Reddit is the first major social network to embrace this concept, and it is making our sub more popular.

With a growing user base, the price of moons is likely to increase in the future. Think 6M now, we will have 10M in the not so distant future. 25M in a few more years."

Has mass adaptation already happened? I understand that this might be what people want to read and im not even sure i believe it but what if mass adaptation is already here.... This is the peak of what it will ever be. 

Billionaires are already manipulting the market both in the form of whales behind the scene or known Billionaires pushing agendas. You think thats any different from a regulated stock exchange? There is so much manipulation in the real world both in the form of insider trading, companies pushing certain stocks, or even politicians getting involved. Dont know about you but I see thay already happening in Crypto... 

What if the Doge and Shiba outburst a while back was already peak... I had my Grandpa ask me about crypto during that time and we always joke that once that happens, we are already too late. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and all socials were hyped beyond belief... what if that was the social mass adaptation peak? 

Countless new technologies have been created that were going to ""change the world"" but never did so. Its very possible the hype will fade and this will all be a blip in history that our children and grandchildren learn about one day. 

We all want to believe that we are still early but what if that boat has already sailed? Hype train gone and left already and we are waiting on the platform left behind waiting for it to come back. What if I'm also just in a depressed mood and playing the devil's advocate... Just wanted to see peoples thoughts."
5/3/23,"AI and Cryptocurrencies: Yes, they can mix.","I’ve recently read a post expressing the opinion that “AI and Cryptocurrencies will never work.” The major supporting argument was based on **Andre Cronje’s comments** on the debate, where he said the following:

https://preview.redd.it/dbgudstnexla1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=283d1a8d8d409d86580e8cbf855f75318cc92b5a

While his descriptions are on point, I got to argue that **blockchain and AI can, in fact, mix.** 

# Here are a few ways a blockchain-based project could implement AI technology:

**1. Improved Scalability:** As more users join a network (e.g. Ethereum), the network becomes congested and slows down. AI can assist with transaction processing optimisation, potentially allowing a network to scale.

**2. Smart contract optimization:** By analysing contract performance data, AI can identify inefficiencies of potential vulnerabilities and suggest improvement.

**3. Network monitoring:** As history tells us, code can be exploited in many ways. AI can be used to monitor a network for potential security threats, smart contract exploits, bridge exploits and other security breaches. This includes tracking network traffic, analyzing transaction metadata, and identifying patterns of behaviour that may indicate an attack.

**4. Fraud detection:** Majority of trading volume nowdays comes from High-Frequency Algorithms (Also known as High Algorithmic Trading), therefore, AI tools can be used to analyze large volumes of transaction data to identify suspicious activity.

Now someone who understands both blockchain technology (the permissionless one), would now ask: *“Wait, don’t all these points scream centralisation?”*

**Well, not necessarily.** While it is true that AI can benefit from having access to large amounts of data (that need to be centrally managed), **it is possible to implement AI tools in a decentralized network.** For example, **machine learning algorithms can be run on decentralized nodes, on a decentralized network, allowing for data to be analyzed in a distributed and decentralized way.** Additionally, blockchain-based projects can use [federated learning](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/federated-learning-collaborative.html), **where AI algorithms are trained across a network of devices, rather than in a centralized location.**

# Ok so... should I buy the hype?

**No.** 

Not yet at least.

As with every new exciting technology segment, it always starts with a massive hype surrounding it. And what usually follows excessive hype? Bubbles. And what do bubbles do? Yep, they burst.

Everyone is drooling over the next shiny project that will allow them mount the AI horse and ride into the sunset. I’m pretty sure there are algorithms out there that scan websites and throw money on everything that contains these two letters. But like I said, there will be a bubble (assuming we’re not in it now). 

Sure, you can go ahead and speculate and try to profit off this hype right now, but if we want to actually realize the full potential of combining these two technologies, then that will take time. 

There are tons of “crypto projects” (using the term project lightly here) that are promising AI technology while selling a centralized token. **Most of these “projects” are solutions looking for problems, projects that are not really focused on AI, or just outright scams.**

Remember, for every Google, there is a Netscape, for every Netflix, there is a Blockbuster. 

I want to remain optimistic and put my faith in the active developers of the space who understand both technologies to fuse the two and produce results that could take new, or existing projects to higher levels, **by improving all three blockchain components: Decentralization, Security and Scalability.**

5/3/23,5 month update I took a job 1200 miles away.,"
Sup guys. 

TLDR I figured I would give a TLDR first this time. Still have both kidneys. Made tons of new friends and business relationships and I have learned so much. 

Working at mining syndicate these last few months have really changed my life. The week after I posted my last post about the job (link in comments) I went to the mining conference hosted by Scott. I got to meet some of you guys in person and you guys remembered my post. It means a lot. Thanks to the people who bought me a drink. You know who you are, mad respect. 

So. Work has been interesting, I got to travel around a little bit looking at new hosting locations. Kansas btw Is 70% gravel roads and super windy. (Yes. I did the ""well I guess we are not in Kansas anymore"" joke when I left). I went to a Texas location where I had to fight off coyotes with a mag light and a Glocko overnight as we are unboxing a box truck full of miners at 3 am. Learned how to operate a 1.5 mw flare gas gen set from cat. Dead ass it's a train engine. 

The environment is interesting.  Texas would be the best man, brides maids and bride at Texas's own wedding. Also. The smallest amount out ice or snow shuts down most of Texas. 

Currently the company is going under some restructuring and things are looking pretty well. Somethings I'm really not happy with, but it's the way she goes. Still going to work my ass off to do what I can to keep machines hashing. They have also decided not to have a 24-7 guy on site. Kinda bummed out about that. I love waking up and going directly to the mine. 

I ended up buying my own camper. Grand design imagine bh2800. Love it. Worked my ass off for that. Probably gonna relocate to RV campground some time in the next month or so. I'm assuming that i will be getting assistance with rent as I can't afford the camper and rent to park it and send back money to home. But only time will tell. 

I still thoroughly enjoy my job and hopefully I will be able to focus more on the repair side of the company. Have tons of things I want to do in this industry. I don't really know what else to say here lol. Currently back in Ohio up with a sick kid at 1am. 

If you have any questions or something to say. Please comment and I will answer your questions or DM me. :) 

Will also post the original post in comments if you wanna read the origin story.

5/3/23,how long until bitcoin is the worlds reference currency?,"Today every news channel in every country displays the exchange rate of their national currency vs the US dollar on a nightly basis in order to guage the strength of their currency. Most people know roughly how much their currency is worth in US dollars.

Ask an indian how much 81,000 rupee is worth and they will say around $1,000 USD. Ask a brit how much 830 pounds is worth and they will say around $1,000 USD. Ask a singaporean how much 1,350 SGD is worth and they will say around $1,000 USD.

Most people dont know what their currency is worth in other national currencies but most people know what their currency is worth in USD because the US dollar is the worlds reference currency.

Bitcoin is still small relative to the USD but it is already becoming more global and more prevalent in most countries, every country has its own bitcoin exchanges. It is also starting to be used more in cross border remittances.

People compare their currency to the US dollar in order to measure their currencies performance. But as the US dollars role deminishes and bitcoins role increases people all over the world will start comparing their currency to bitcoin in order to measure their currencies performance.

There will come a time where bitcoin takes over the role of being the go-to reference currency. Soon more people will know what their currency is worth in bitcoin than know what their currency is worth in US dollars and the goal will not be to maintain stability against the USD but to maintain stability against bitcoin.

When this happens bitcoin would have become the worlds reference currency for individuals and after that its only a matter of time before bitcoin becomes the worlds reference currency for institutions and even governments.

The ironic part is no national currency could possibly maintain value against bitcoin as they are all debasing at such a rapid rate. So as bitcoin becomes the worlds default reference currency it will completely unmask just how weak all national currencies are and cause people to see exactly why they should be saving in bitcoin instead of saving in fiat."

In this case, Bitcoin advocates could easily say *""Cool. In that case, keep a little bit of gold just in case \[any of the above\] happens""*.... and see it as an emergency fund for your Bitcoin.

People would then be less wary towards what Bitcoin protects against - which is the *near-one-hundred-percent chance* of fiat losing value, and the background risk of wealth being confiscated / manipulated.

There's a great opportunity for pitching a *diversified hedge* against fiat inflation and manipulation. This should be an easy opportunity since everyone knows there's only a limited amount of gold that's physically practical to self-custody.

But nope - usually, its ""All-or-Nothing"" with both sides being dismissive of the advantages of the other. Sometimes it seems that even a 90/10 split is frowned upon. And I don't think any of these sides have issues with having a cash-based emergency fund (so that they don't invest in Bitcoin/Gold what they can't afford to lose).

Unfortunately, I think that sentiment may be based on each tribe trying to pump its own asset. This doesn't seem as intense in other asset classes. - the SP500 index is an example of diversification.

&#x200B;

Anyone else notice this? Does anyone on this subreddit feel that having Bitcoin nullifies the benefit of having ANY physical gold - as it would be interesting to hear your thoughts?"

Example Kraken, If i buy GALA and i want to transfer it to my wallet they will take half of my coin during the transfer so if i transfer 60 gala i will lose 30.

I dont think exchange is way to go so my question is what are some other legit ways one can buy Crypto and send it to their wallet?

If yes, then can you guys tell me which crypto token chart is best suited for scalping? I know every token was scalpable, but their price action movement was a little bit different. So, my question is: which crypto tokens do you guys like to scalp? 

I know many people suggest about BTC and ETH, but personally, I observed that these tokens give a very low percentage of profits, and fees eat them all up. Another factor was that there were too many big wicks, which are pathetic for scalping. So I just want to know which coin's chart price action movement is smooth, gives a good percentage of profits, and you guys like to scalp?"

5/3/23,thank you Coinbase.,I want to thank you and your team for honoring my trade today when stx was down even when you was upgrading your site today . Thanks.
5/3/23,What Canadian debit card works with Coinbase?,"I’m with the Bank Of Montreal (BMO Bank) and it doesn’t support Coinbase. 
I googled “Crypto-friendly banks” and found KOHO. I opened with KOHO and soon after I tried to add it to my payment method it says it doesn’t support ‘prepaid’ cards. 

I’m going to open another bank account but I need to be sure I can buy crypto with it. Any ideas on which Canadian bank is best compatible with Coinbase? 
Please let me know cheers!"
5/3/23,Did anyone see any kind of upgrade or anything different in Coinbase after the maintenance? Does your Coinbase wallet allow you to swap? Mine doesn't.,"I can't tell anything has been changed or improved. I've learned that their wallet seems to be scam. No swap button on the phone app and the browser extension on Chrome crashes after logging in. I can't do anything with my ETH now. I can't swap it for anything. It let me connect the wallet to Uniswap but won't let me confirm any swaps. I'm glad it was only a small amount because I feel like I will never have access to that ETH again. The support team is useless. They'll tell you to clear all of the cookies, cache, and reboot your PC and make sure the software is up to date. I've done it multiple times with no luck. My phone is and older Samsung with Android 6.0.1. so I can understand it not working correctly but my PC is Windows 10 with the latest Chrome and latest wallet extension. There is no reason for the PC not to work."

5/3/23,There's a cross in the charts..But what kind of cross is it?,"Article taken from satirical crypto currency site Planet Crypto Space.

Source:[https://planetcrypto.space/theres-a-cross-in-the-charts-but-what-kind-of-cross-is-it/](https://planetcrypto.space/theres-a-cross-in-the-charts-but-what-kind-of-cross-is-it/)

ANDY GRAF, OUR ANALYST EXPLAINS ALL..

The Bitcoin chart was greeted with frenzied excitement this week when a rare cross shape appeared in the charts… and Planet Crypto’s market analyst, Andy Graf, caught his breath long enough to explain: “Once in a blue moon, the line for the 50-Day Moving Average crosses the line for the 200-Day Moving Average. I bet you’re asking yourself: what does this MEAN??

“Well, Whenever this cross has appeared before, something major has always happened to the price.

Amongst the first few times it happened, the price went up a lot, people got very excited, and the pattern was dubbed the ‘GOLDEN CROSS’.

Also amongst those times, the price went down a lot, people got very depressed and it was dubbed the ‘DEATH CROSS’.

And then there were times when the price jump-jumped – and it was dubbed the KRISS KROSS in honour of the rapper’s song.

Dotted in-between those times, it ended up going up and going down then sideways, in different directions, and it was called ‘a MALTESE CROSS’.

Then there was also the time the price rose like a pastry in an oven, and people got hungry for the taste of success, and it was labelled the ‘HOT CROSS (Bun)’.

“Anyway, these clear precedents allow us to say with an unusual degree of certainty what will happen to Bitcoin next – it will either go up, or down, or stay roughly the same. And how often can we say that with confidence, right? Savvy investors should use this golden opportunity to buy. Or sell. Or hodl. You choose. But frankly, with this information at your fingertips, you’d have to be a fool to make the wrong move.”

Andy Graf concluded, “Of course, it could be that analysts like me are trying to impose meaning onto a pattern that has over time proven itself to be meaningless, but I can’t contemplate that right now. The dam has well and truly burst and I’m SO EXCITED I could wet myself! …I might have to go for a LEGS CROSS.”"
