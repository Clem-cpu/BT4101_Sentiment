Richard Heart has removed all references to ""HEX"" from his twitter profile.

With the SEC coming down hard on projects that are likely to fall foul of securities reporting regulations Richard Heart, AKA ""Owner of the worlds largest diamond"" AKA ""Hex is not a scam"" has recently completely wiped all references of HEX from his twitter profile.  


For reference here's how it used to look:

The ""Is hex a scam"" question has been asked and answered a million times over and there are countless people on both sides who will loudly proclaim it is or isn't but two years into the ""project"" nothing exists and the founder has wiped all references of it from his twitter bio shortly after posting about how they are no longer calling staking staking but instead some other newspeak nonsense to try and pull the wool over the SEC's eyes."

7/3/23,Nayib Bukele: Bitcoin has increased tourism in El Salvador by 95%,"&#x200B;

President Nayib Bukele has stated that tourism in El Salvador has increased by 95% since the adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) as a legal tender.

During an [interview on ""Tucker Carlson Today](https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1632217451197788162?s=20),"" Nayib Bukele revealed El Salvador's achievements since adopting Bitcoin as a legal tender in 2021:

>""This gives us an advantage in the new economic system that is coming. And we have seen some benefits. (...) Our tourism has increased by 95%, and it's partly because of Bitcoin. There are a lot of Bitcoiners that want to travel to the only country where Bitcoin is legal tender. We have Bitcoin conferences, etc. So we have had a lot of tourism because of that, and we've also had a lot of private investment.""

https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1632217451197788162?s=20 

# Nayib Bukele: Bitcoin is an escape from censorship 

The President of El Salvador also praised some of Bitcoin's inherent features. He noted that the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is used worldwide, even ""in countries where it's been banned.""

In this particular case, Nayib Bukele emphasized that ""you cannot ban it. You cannot censor it. Even if you want to censor it, you can't."" He later added:

>""There are people looking for an escape from censorship or laws that want to ban this new technology. So they look for countries that are more open to these technologies.""

During the interview, he was asked about traditional finance-focused media and companies that criticized El Salvador's decisions. The President noted that they hate such initiatives:

>""The IMF, the World Bank, the Federal Reserve, and most, if not all, economic media: Bloomberg, CNBC, Financial Times, Forbes. We've received a lot of negative reports, fake news, and FUD, as Bitcoiners call it. They publish lies (...) but one particular thing about these lies is that they don't last very long.""

# El Salvador: The first country in the world to adopt BTC as legal tender 

September 7, 2021, was indelibly inscribed in human history. On that day, Bitcoin officially became a legal tender in El Salvador.

&#x200B;

Since that day, various initiatives have emerged in this Central American country. A veterinary center was built, which was fully financed using Bitcoin. Geothermal energy is also used to mine BTC.

Nayib Bukele also announced the creation of Bitcoin City. In November 2022, the President of El Salvador announced that he would be buying 1 BTC every day through the DCA strategy.

However, El Salvador is constantly criticized by traditional financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank."

7/3/23,What is the most overvalued crypto project right now?,"Normally, during this bear run we discuss all the potential that different cryptocurrencies have these days or how undervalued they are. We are addicted to hopium in this sub. However, I would also like to know if you think there are overvalued cryptos even during this winter when the prices are relatively low.

We all want our coins to reach the sky, but is there any specific project you think that will go even deeper? Is there any worthless crypto whose market cap shall descend into the deep and never come back?"

7/3/23,What‚Äôs a weirdly specific inside joke from a cryptocurrency community that you are aware of?,"I think all of us in the sub are very aware of certain inside jokes that only we on r/cryptocurrency are aware of: 

- 100K BTC EOY 2021! 

- SOL going down

- Moon farming/shitposting puns 

I‚Äôm wondering what are other jokes being circled around in smaller crypto communities? 

I know in Nano, there is a lot of broccoli talk with no real elaborationü•¶. That‚Äôs because it started as a comment accordion one day when someone was trying to spell out ‚Äúbullish‚Äù in the comments as usual, but the next person added ‚Äúr‚Äù as their comment instead of ‚Äúu‚Äù and it took off from there. 

I‚Äôm curious if the Monero community really talks about losing money in boating accidents as much as it seems here. I imagine there‚Äôs some Chad Vitalik memes. 

The smaller the community and the more oddly specific the joke, the better.

Edit: An older nano joke for the raiblocks fans: What if it goes to 2k?"
7/3/23,"Powell Says Crypto Isn't the Problem, Lack of Regulation Is","During Powell's recent testimony before Congress, which was primarily about inflation, housing prices, and rate hikes, towards the very end he was asked and did comment about Crypto.

Powell said crypto is innovative and a good technology, he said it does have a future and he did point out that many of the problems we've seen in the last year with exchanges going down and companies defaulting, these are problems also faced by traditional financial systems and markets.

What he did point out is that it's still the wild west and there's a lack of regulation in the space. He seemed to allude to what we all know that crypto is not the problem, scammy companies and individuals in the space are the problem. Essentially he stated a lack of regulation is the problem not crypto itself. 

I know many people here don't want regulation and while that is one of the draws of crypto for mainstream adoption to happen and for it to intertsect more with traditional markets and financial systems we are going to need some regultion."
7/3/23,"The truth is that to make a lot of money, you need a lot of money to begin with","Unless someone has gotten lucky and invested in Bitcoin right when it started, it takes a lot of money to make a lot of money in Crypto.




When you see people ending up with millions, it's because they had invested hundreds of thousands, not mere couple thousands. Even a 10x is amazing for your investment, but if you've only invested a small amount, that won't you give the chance to retire with that money, as even that's rare to see today, unless we're talking about Memecoins and all. 



What's possible of course is to find some kind of a memecoin or a new alt for that 100x, but 90% of the time this is just throwing your money to trash, because only a few people truly make that much money out of those coins, and you become a victim of all the people who did. 


The risky side of it is simply too risky for someone who doesn't have much money to invest in it. No one who is poor can throw in a thousand dollar into a coin that has a 99% chance of making him lose all his money in a single day. And I definitely don't recommend this route. 


If you've not invested much, it's also better to keep in mind how much realistically you can make and not get carried away with all these prices."
7/3/23,Never Use SMS 2FA,"In light of recent news of Coinbase being sued from a guy getting hacked for 96K for using 2FA SMS.

You should never absolutely never, use 2FA SMS. Always use an Authenticator app such as

* Google Authenticator
* Aegis (For Android users)

Cons of SMS 2FA:

**Vulnerable to SIM swapping attacks** ‚Äì An attacker takes over the mobile phone number by cheating the mobile telecom provider into linking the number to the attacker's SIM card. Susceptible to SIM duplication attacks ‚Äì An attacker uses SIM card copying software to create a copy of the real SIM card.

If you're a newbie I/We suggest you use 2FA App Authenticator like Google Authenticator and they are also easy to use and much safer to use as well. It's better to be safe with your Crypto than to use shitty protection security. 

Be safe and always use an Authenticator app."
7/3/23,Moon TVL reaches 300 000$ on sushiswap,"Reaching nearly 350 000$ DEX TVL (according to [ccmoons.com](https://ccmoons.com)) and a totally astonishing 300 000$ on [sushi.com](https://sushi.com). Over the last 7 days the liquidity on [sushi.com](https://sushi.com) nearly doubled. From 179k (feb 28) to 300k (march 7 09:39 UTC). Lets look at some charts shall we.

&#x200B;

Volume has increased to a steady level looking at 21-januari to present time. This shows some great stability increase even in this bear market. 

&#x200B;

Since the CCIP-051 date 15-feb we've gained nearly 200 000$ worth of liquidity. Which is an amazing accomplishment for a small market cap coin like ours.

However the price seems to be working a stead crab so far. As a summary, we're in good shape but liquidity could always get higher. If you have the spare eth and moons, try it out and add to the pools. There's plenty of material on how to do it and you don't need to add all your moons to LP. You can always start with a small amount."

7/3/23,Friend says investing in stocks is better than crypto,"I don't have enough information and the stuff i read are a bit too technical for me to understand and then explain to others. I love crypto because it's fast and it's the only international currency available in my country. But as an investment, i'm really not sure what's best in the long run. I'm a bit skeptical when it comes to crypto because it's so fragile. Any news can affect it and you are more likely to lose your money overnight than stocks. If you truly believe crypto is the best investment, can you *in very simple terms* tell me why?"
7/3/23,Today's a Big Day for me. Ten Years on Reddit! Here's what I've learned...,"So yes, big day for me. Cake day and all that jazz. Ten years ago, I tentatively created an account here on Reddit, and explored a plethora of subs. My faves have to be funny, pics, writingprompts, and, OF COURSE, CryptoCurrency.

Now, I can't say for certain when I started browsing CryptoCurrency,  but I sure wish it had been earlier. I also wish I had started commenting earlier - I think my moon count would have been significantly higher. Oh well, you know what they say - ""The best time to plant a tree is twenty years ago. The second best time is today."" So no use complaining about time lost, I guess - time to just crack on! (But honestly, there are bots with 10x more moons than me!!)

But on to what I've learned, specifically from this sub:

1. No one has a clue. No, seriously, any 'advice' is actually speculation. You can't accurately predict what is going to happen by looking to the past.
2. Everyone has an opinion. Including me. Like the one above.
3. Scams. Scams everywhere.
4. Don't invest more than you're willing to lose. Set yourself a limit. Stick to it.
5. You're supposed to buy low, sell high, NOT the other way round!!!!

There's probably loads more, that's all I can think of for now. But I've got three questions for YOU:

1. How long have you been on Reddit?
2. How long have you been subbed to CryptoCurrency?
3. If today was somebody's first time visiting this sub, what solid piece of advice would you give them?"

7/3/23,Crypto communities worshipping coin/token founders is as anti-crypto as it gets.,"I don't know if this is a popular or unpopular opinion but this phenomenon has been driving me nuts ever since the whole ICO craze in 2017.

Look, I understand that it is reasonable to invest in a project (in this case a public or private company) when you believe in its CEO/Founder. Hell, even some of the biggest investors of our Generation advise us to search for companies with great leaders.

BUT, not only this phenomenon appears in cryptocurrencies, that **shouldn't even have a founder in the first place**, but the worshipping of crypto founders is just insane. I'm just going to say it from the bottom of my heart:

**If your favorite cryptocurrency/coin/token/project has a single face behind it, then it's not a cryptocurrency.**

**Warning:** I am going to mention specific projects here. This is not to witch hunt any project, but it's just to provide a few examples and explain my rant. 

- Cardano (ADA): I believe Cardano is a solid project, but the obsession of the community and the ""founder"" [Charles Hoskinson](https://i.redd.it/lj5xvy9ca9n61.jpg) is just insane, imo.

- Safemoon: I don't know who needs to hear this today, but yes, this thing is a scam. Yet, search for an online safemoon community and you can see how they worship this [con-artist John Karony](https://imgur.com/a/sEzeaMz). *Captain HODL, Crypto Influencer of the Year...* Brb lemme throw up real quick

- Loopring (LRC): I too bought the hype. I still believe it's a solid project. But being part of the loopring subreddit made me realize how obsessed everyone was with individuals like Bryon etc.

- HEX: This has been around for ages and it's even more relevant now that the ""founder"" Richard Heart is being called out. I mean, this guy is as [obnoxious](https://preview.redd.it/58wjtjv7tama1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c307971d54e35de3582fb1677a96dcea8bec77e3) as it gets.

- Tron (TRX): Justin Sun... We all know who this guy is. I seriously can't, and will not ever trust this guy. He's been shoving his nose everywhere and the TRX community adores him for some reason. [Read more here](https://www.theverge.com/c/22947663/justin-sun-tron-cryptocurrency-poloniex)

This whole tribalism, figure worshipping just doesn't make sense in a space where decentralisation is one of the fundamental pillars of the technology. Satoshi Nakamoto did what they did for a reason. They created btc, threw it in the streets and vanished. If this tells us anything is that **a true cryptocurrency doesn't need to have a ""founder"", ""CEO"", ""captain"" behind it. The ultimate test is for it to survive through the power of its community alone.**"

Richard: I have nothing to do with HEX, I don't know what is it. But I do own the fastest Ferrari.

7/3/23,Do You Think Monero Will Be Around For A Long Time?,"The first time I‚Äôve ever heard of Monero was when I first joined this sub a couple of years ago, I enjoyed the fact that it‚Äôs a completely private currency. (I do not hold Monero)

*Monero is the leading cryptocurrency focused on private and censorship-resistant transactions. The majority of existing cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, have transparent blockchains. Transactions can be verified and/or traced by anyone in the world. This means that the sending and receiving addresses of these transactions could potentially be linked to real-world identities. Monero, on the other hand, uses various privacy-enhancing technologies to ensure the anonymity of its users.*

*Monero transactions are confidential and untraceable. Unlike selectively transparent alternatives (e.g. Zcash), Monero is the only major cryptocurrency where every user is anonymous by default. The sender, receiver, and amount of every single transaction are hidden through the use of three important technologies: Stealth Addresses, Ring Signatures, and RingCT. Because every transaction is private, Monero cannot be traced. This makes it a true, fungible currency. Merchants and individuals accepting Monero do not need to worry about blacklisted or tainted coins.*

*Monero is electronic cash that allows fast, inexpensive payments to and from anywhere in the world. With Monero, there are no wire transfer or check clearing fees, no multi-day holding periods, and no fraudulent chargebacks. Because Monero is decentralized, it is not constrained by any particular legal jurisdiction and provides safety from capital control.*

I find Monero to be a really badass coin, with real world use case for private transactions. I do not hold Monero at all, but doing some research it seems like a great tool to use when making certain transactions.

Do you guys think Monero will be around for a long time? Possibly even forever?"

7/3/23,"Beware of crypto dusting attack, they are one of the most popular ways of hacking in cryptocurrencies","Dust attacks are a type of cyber attack that targets the cryptocurrency wallets of individuals with small amounts of cryptocurrency in them. The attackers send a small amount of cryptocurrency, known as ""dust,"" to the target wallet. The dust is usually a tiny fraction of the target's cryptocurrency balance, such as 0.0000001 BTC. (a few sats)  


[A  BNB dust](https://preview.redd.it/dv90if87iama1.png?width=657&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d68f61e52681089d0a1270155aba7254321a7b38)

The goal of the dust attack is to deanonymize the target by linking their wallet address to other addresses on the blockchain. The dust transaction includes scam URLs, meta data such as the IP address of the sender and other identifying information, that can be used to link the target wallet to other transactions or wallets.

The hackers use this obtained user information and use social engineering to find any vulnerabilities to extort the user of their crypto.

In case you fall victim to a dusting attack, you don't need to panic, assets can't be directly stolen, with dusting attacks and you are the fate of your own reaction - which means that you cannot possibly be affected by this as long as you are aware of what is going on."

* BTC was at the ATH around \~$69K
* ETH was around $4,850
* ADA was around $2.35

Nearly 16 months later - multiple crypto institutions have collapsed, lots of hyped coins have retraced all bull market gains, some of them are even ghost chains..  you know how the story goes..

* BTC is at $22.3K
* ETH is at $1,570
* ADA is at $.33
* Moons are at $.23

7/3/23,Reminder to Withdraw your assets from MyAlgo wallet,"Good morning guys this is just a small reminder that MyAlgo wallet, the native wallet for Algorand, was hacked last week and MyAlgo has advised all users to withdraw their funds or re-deposit them into a new account as soon as possible.

MyAlgo is a third party wallet so nothing to do with the native Algo Smart contracts etc.
I think we still don't know the reason behind the hack but Please withdraw everything as soon as possible if you haven't done it already.

Have a great day an be careful out there."

But holy shit the last few hours have been insane.

Based on the above, not even new MyAlgo wallets are safe anymore. The entire MyAlgo ecosystem seems to be truly compromised, and some users have even tested this: [https://np.reddit.com/r/AlgorandOfficial/comments/11khgdy/important\_myalgo\_wallet\_is\_truly\_compromised/](https://np.reddit.com/r/AlgorandOfficial/comments/11khgdy/important_myalgo_wallet_is_truly_compromised/)

Do not, I repeat, do not create a new MyAlgo wallet and transfer your funds there - the whole MyAlgo network itself is not SAFU. Transfer your tokens over to a new Pera wallet, or even better, a Pera wallet rekeyed to a Ledger.

* If you've deployed your MyAlgo seedphrase on a Pera wallet, rekey immediately
* If you have an ALGO wallet that has interacted with a MyAlgo wallet before, rekey immediately
* If you rekeyed to a new MyAlgo wallet last week, shift your funds to a new Pera or DeFly wallet IMMEDIATELY.

I transferred my stuff over to a Ledger Pera wallet in the nick of time. Cutting it close but I'm glad that's done and over with.

My heart truly goes out to those on the Algo sub that found themselves at the center of this shitshow. And hundreds of other painful reports across all the Algorand Discord channels that I'm in. Thousands of ALGO drained. Thousands of hours of hard work, sweat, blood and tears just wrenched from their hands.

It's heartbreaking, fuck these scammers."
7/3/23,Decentralisation is the ONLY point of crypto and should be a priority in any investment,"There has been a bit of a debate on this subreddit about the role of decentralisation in crypto. One post in particular argued that centralisation is needed from the start of a project's journey to encourage development. I believe that decentralisation is the **ONLY** point of crypto and should be sought out as a priority and not be a future promise.

Crypto has so many comparable non-crypto centralised alternatives, which can provide the same features. Here is a small list of features that crypto can offer, and a centralised/non-crypto alternative:

* Store of Value - Gold/Silver/general commodities
* Transfer of money - PayPal/CashApp/Venmo
* Yield products - Bonds/Some investment trusts/REITs
* Investment opportunities - Stock market/Private Equity/Fine Art
* NFTs - ownership papers
* Privacy - Cash (admittedly weak, I‚Äôm not an XMR shill I promise)

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm missing a few, but my point is that one can access all of these features in a centralised manner. What crypto offers is the ability to access all of these features in a trustless way. I.e. You no longer rely on PayPal to ‚Äúallow‚Äù you to send and withdraw money, it is all done by the network instead. The only differentiating factor between these centralised options and crypto is that crypto does not rely on companies/middle men.

**All other features of a crypto, say fast speed, low fees, and any other great technical advancements, are just a means to make the decentralised product better, but are not the main feature by any means.**

Take BTC. It sits at #1 because it is the best store of value of any crypto, but the reason it has any value in the first place is because it is decentralised."

7/3/23,How has your personal use of crypto evolved since you first bought? I only feel I really adopted crypto in the past 12 months despite being around for a while.,"I've been around since about 2016 when my friend first mentioned Bitcoin to me. My younger brother was around for longer and bought a tonne of Doge when it became popular on 4Chan, but he never talked to me about crypto.

I've held Bitcoin in varying amounts since then, have been through a few exchange hacks, mining trojans and seed losses. But I'd say it's only been the last 24 months that I've really started to adopt crypto outside of speculative investment and that I've actually started learning the ecosystem.

I got my first cold storage around late 2017, but I was purely using CEXs for my transactions. I joined a couple of ICOs (the days of yeeting ETH into the void hoping to receive some Korean haircut token that your cousin said is going to 1 mil), but other than that it was  just buy and ruin my relationships with my peers by getting them into crypto.

In 2020 I finally started using cryptocurrency in ways it was intended, I'd get coffees from my friends at work for NANO, and started selling steam cosmetics and stuff for ETH or LTC. I even accepted ETH for random shit I'd sell on Gumtree (like the Australian craigslist).

I used my first swap in 2021 after my first MOONs distribution (not understanding karma multipliers at all), but it wasn't until Reddit NFTs that I really consider myself having adopted crypto. This made me install metamask and learn how networks worked and how easy DEXes and swaps actually are. It's also been this year that I first began staking, and this week that I learned how to provide to liquidity pools thanks to Moons.

What's been your journey? What phase of this are you at, and what parts of the ecosystem that you enjoy have I not discovered yet?"

 So instead of sending Eth ( which is like $6-$20 as of late) I sent via polygon. Less than a cent!

Two years ago we were still in a bull run, meaning that 50% of the current supply held through the whole brutal bear market.","It is always very interesting to look at on-chain metrics as those can play a significant role in measuring the sentiment of us all and especially also look back at the history of us all. One very interesting metric here are the ‚ÄúSupply last active‚Äú bands, which show when what percentage of the circulating supply has been last moved. This shows the amount of long-term holders.

But also this shows indirectly through what many of those long-term holders went through and still endured to survive. Right now there is a prime example of that, we just hit 50% on our 2 year Supply Last Active bands:

Now when we turn back the clock two year, we will be in early 2021 where we were still in a bull market and at roughly a $56k price. This also shows that 50% of the circulating supply had long-term holders that went through the rest of the euphoric bull market and then faced a 75% drawdown from ATH but still remained steady. 

Those long-term holders literally faced everything from Chinas mining ban, to Future ETFs approved to LUNA and FTX implosion. All of that to still be here.

I believe that many here right now are also part of those long-term holders, even I am part of that very group. This just happens to show how many people were capable of holding through one of the most brutal periods in Bitcoins history. That really deserved a loud clap for all of them!üëè"

7/3/23,Overview of the MyAlgo wallet hack and how users are dealing with the news,"This issue appears to be with MyAlgo browser wallets - it started back on February 21st.

MyAlgo recommended that users should move their funds off of MyAlgo wallets on February 27th

you can see the original overview of the issue [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/11de4a0/over_13_million_algorand_hack_still_not_resolved/) on a post I made last week.

Since the original attack seemed to be targeted to larger wallets many users ignored the warning and left their funds on MyAlgo wallet, this was due to some of them not wanting to lose their governance rewards. Starting yesterday many users with smaller amounts started getting their wallets drained and posting about it on social media.

&#x200B;

[some of the post](https://preview.redd.it/erofjyhmkcma1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f665f8bd6649c99b4790bcffe3dc54e92a9a8891)

These smaller wallets getting drained also started selling off their ASA's (Algos version of ERC-20 tokens) this prompted many of the companies building projects on Algorand to pull liquidity from the pools essentially rug pulling holders. This is supposedly for the users protection as they don't want the attackers being able to steal the liquidity from the pools.

some users basically got rugged due to this, although the project devs are promising that they are going to reimburse users.

https://preview.redd.it/q9pdwjc4edma1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8dcea40b5630c48b66dda86b1cbd71e8209a5296

Many users who have moved funds out of their MyAlgo wallets have dropped out of governance (Algos form of staking), forcing them to forfeit their governance rewards to keep their ALGO safe in a separate wallet. 

https://preview.redd.it/ehy8lfomlcma1.png?width=2550&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7cef0a9a8c104e10b2a9ddc3c0670da6a7df74cc

&#x200B;

Other users are calling on the Algorand foundation to use the funds they currently hold to make the victims whole again. It's important to note that MyAlgo wallet is not the official wallet of Algorand but a third party wallet, although it was recommended by The Algorand foundation as one of the wallets to use. I personally doubt that this is going to happens but I guess we will see if the foundation makes a statement on it.

https://preview.redd.it/fdl9mgk4mcma1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bc076157af822fa41f13dc6561ffb948581bed94

The best way for everybody to have avoided this was using a hardware wallet or moving their funds as soon as issues started coming up about MyAlgo.

It's also surprising that some of the larger projects on Algorand were using hot wallets to hold large amounts of funds.

If you are holding any funds on MyAlgo make sure to move them to Pera wallet or a hardware wallet.

you can view the twitter thread from the official Algorand foundation [here](https://twitter.com/AlgoFoundation/status/1632867775596175362?cxt=HHwWhIC9mealjqktAAAA)

If you have had funds taken it' s recommended you fill out the form shown below which you can find [here](https://twitter.com/d13_co/status/1632957575699283970) \- this will be used to investigate your lost funds.

7/3/23,"It is easy to be fooled by all the success stories you hear, but there are thousands of losers for every winner","Yes, we are all hyped about the prospect of crypto, me included. I frequently day dream about a world where crypto is the norm and my toilet runs on the blockchain. And yes, I also dream that my investments will give me the financial freedom to live a stress free life. 

We hear about the stories of people making millions only with a few thousand. Massive gains like this are only possible if you are extremely early and extremely lucky on low cap coins, making the whole thing extremely unrealistic. 

We like to meme on failed projects such as LUNA which is healthy. But lots of people got really destroyed and I can imagine that for some people it turned into depression because of what they lost. This is what happens all the time and is way more common than making millions. Keep this in mind.

Still we dream of making it big and that is ok, it's fun. Realistically speaking though, most people lose money in crypto  and especially right now most of us are in the red. It is important to remind oneself that we mostly are confronted with success stories, and that also applies to other aspects in life other than crypto. If you keep this in mind you will be less likely to make wiser choices and not succumb to FOMO - the biggest enemy of success.

Maybe the barrier of entry is too high by there is a decent amount of knowledge you would have to acquire to understand the technology. I just do not get it. Maybe they truly just wanna be ignorant.

Considering the general bearish situation of the market, what could have caused such a trend inversion for our beloved token? I read something about Kraken burning some MOONs for a banner, may that have caused a FOMO chain reaction?

7/3/23,Several reasons why I think that there won‚Äòt be a bull run in 2023 but much rather in 2024.,"After we finally had a bit of a rally this year which even broke through very important resistance points, there surely was a it of an euphoria in the air as numerous patters and fractals from previous price actions after a bear market suggested that a mini bull market is awaiting us or perhaps even a bigger bull market.

While we certainly can not really predict anything exactly, there are several reasons why a bull run or a bigger rally this year is rather unlikely. Here are some of the biggest reasons:

1. A reaccelerating Inflation causing the FED to not pause but continue rate hikes:

&#x200B;

[CPI chart from CNBC](https://preview.redd.it/gnzxqouc4dma1.jpg?width=1083&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c7d9023c8175693db487d1b3501972fed5400947)

Crypto is usually very coupled with stock markets even if there are indeed periods of negative correlations. Further the stock market directly reacts on the FED rate hikes which react on inflation. A higher inflation would cause the FED to continue hiking than to stop which would obviously put pressure on Crypto.

&#x200B;

2. Even the FED pausing or sinking rates has usually not had a good effect on the markets.

While it may paradoxical that we want the FED to sink the rates again or pause them and on the other hand we can see that historically once that happened stock markets were under pressure agains and thus Crypto would be too. So both ways we would need to look out for some short-term turbulences.

&#x200B;

3. Stricter Crypto regulations causing many crypto projects to be in trouble.

We basically already got a demo of this a few weeks back when the SEC became active and was pushing exchanges to stop offering staking, while this is actually good as self-custody is better than exchanges anyway. Such news will still have negative effects on Crypto as through the years exchanges have just become a big part of Crypto.

&#x200B;

Those are just the three biggest reasons for me while there are a lot of other macro, regulatory and fraud reasons that could cause some turmoil in Crypto. What do you think will happen this year, lets engage in a discussion down below:"
7/3/23,Does it hurt seeing your portfolio?," I was thinking about this, I saw my portfolio on my ledger and it's in the red, nothing too bad only like probably -4% down all over the board (ETH saving it for being -11%). Even if we are in a bear market and I know I'll just hold till the bull or till I die it still hit physiologically. Maybe in a year seeing things will be different, but for now it feels like there  is nothing I can do. (Feel sorry for the people who hold during the start of the bear, I know that my -% is pretty good)

But wait, I enter to CMK to check my whole portfolio, to see the other coins I don't have in my ledger and all of the sudden I see it, moons, shining with a strong green color, coins I got for free and pumping with a great future if they ever get listed on a big CEX, thing that doesn't look impossible. it's another piece of my portfolio that I will keep buying and farming. For must of as it's that low cap gem we have, that one that we believe will give the biggest returns in a bull

 Does it affect you the same way it does to me? I've seen users with thousands and probably it's too their only green part of their portfolio, does it help alleviate the unnecessary worries?  If you don't have a vault, open it right now"
7/3/23,How to live of crypto after cashing out?,"Recently, I saw a post that stated you have to think about when to cash out. If you do not have specific numbers for the prices of your coins in mind, where you push the SELL button, then you will ride the next bull run until it becomes a bear market again. The message of this post was reasonable, so I checked the stats and decided when I plan to sell for all coins I have got.

The question now is, what then? Imagine, I sold a big part or all of my coins for $$$ and they are laying on the exchange, where I made the trade. What should I do? I like the idea of passive income. Therefore, my first thought was to exchange the cash 50/50 in USDT/USDC and put them in a farm for liquidity mining, so I can live of the interest.

Would this be reasonable? Where should I farm? What are the things to watch out for? Do you have better ideas? I would love to hear them."

7/3/23,This week it‚Äôs been 11 years since I first got introduced to Bitcoin,"This week marks the 11th anniversary since I was first introduced to Bitcoin. It was a coworker who tried to convince me to invest in Bitcoin back then in March 2012 and suggested that I should invest around 5,000 NOK, which was equivalent to around 850 USD at the time.

Or 150+ BTC‚Ä¶

I laughed him off, and didn't see the potential in Bitcoin at the time. After all, back in 2012 Bitcoin was still in its infancy, and very few people had heard of it. It was hard to imagine that a digital currency could have any real-world value or use.

So yeah, could have been filthy rich.. that‚Äôs something that made me thoughtful on a Tuesday..  but still, it‚Äôs a story to tell the grandkids.. I guess ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


And before you ask when I jumped the train and first invest in Bitcoin?: December 2017 üëä
Yeah.. that also sucks..

But hey; I‚Äôm here now! And DCA has been a long time friend of mine ü•≥

My coworker? Rich? I have no idea. I moved 5 months later.

Edit:
Just have to clarify that I have no regrets about this today. I look upon it as a lesson learned and a great story. Actually it‚Äôs my go to story when I first introduce cryptocurrencies for friends. We are still early, and many today have the same thoughts and doubts as I had back in 2012."
7/3/23,Bloomberg Intelligence is giving Grayscale a 70% chance for spot ETF approval,"Starting out at 40% and then upped to 60% chance of being approved, it has now been updated to 70% expecting a ruling in 2Q/3Q vacating the rejection order. Amazing how fast this is going but the judges once again seem to have a really sour taste for SEC shenanigans when it comes to crypto.

They made remarks such as ‚Äúone is just a derivative of the other, whats the difference‚Äù and ‚Äúdont they track each other by over 99%?‚Äù. SEC tried saying that Grayscale didnt provide requisite information but they didnt buy it saying the paperwork doesnt differ that much. They even gave the impression the SEC may be violating APA by being prejudicial and denying nearly identical market products (spot/futures). Atleast 2/3 judges were shoving the SEC lawyer in a fuckin locker with the other being more inquisitive, its kind of annoying that it took so long to get this heard considering how strongly they felt about it but i guess that‚Äôs bureaucracy.

Its awesome seeing crypto companies get big wins and do this in absence of Congress stepping up. Hopefully the spot ETF conversion happens scoring huge points for crypto and highlighting more ineptitude from the SEC.

Sidenote: props if you picked up the discount on GBTC, up >10%. ‚ÄúBe greedy when others are fearful‚Äù."

7/3/23,My experience in buying goods in Lugano using Bitcoin and the LVGA token,"I live in a town close to Lugano. We have had the possibility of paying taxes in Bitcoin for years and we have several crypto ATM machines around town but I haven't seen any shops that actually accept crypto. Today I decided to go to Lugano and try using Bitcoin and the LVGA tokens instead of my credit card.

I searched online and found several merchants in the city (around 300!) that accept Bitcoin, including a local souvenir shop, McDonald's and a jeweller where I bought a watch. 

Especially in the jeweller's shop the experience was quite easy. The shopkeeper asked me directly if I wanted to pay with crypto. The whole process was pretty quick and painless, just scan the QR code and pay. Within seconds, the Bitcoin transaction was sent to the shop's Bitcoin wallet address. The shopkeeper verified the transaction and confirmed that he had received the payment.

As I continued my experiment in Lugano, I saw several other merchants accepting Bitcoin (it usually says directly on the door). I used it to pay for a coffee at a caf√© and even purchased a ticket to visit a local museum. Each time, the transaction was quick and seamless, and I have to say that I felt proud to be part of the growing crypto community! 

I asked a few questions and everyone told me pretty much the same thing. Not many people are actually paying using crypto but the number is slowly growing.

Overall, my experience of using Bitcoin to buy goods and services in Lugano was positive, and I was pleased to see how easy it was to use cryptocurrency in the city."
7/3/23,Analysis on which country will lead in the most in crypto growth,"My thought process was if I find out what kind of markets or countries utilize crypto the most, I would be able to easier decide which cryptos fit their needs more and what to DCA into. At first glance I thought the USA would be the easy answer, but the answer was a little more complicated.

Surprisingly, the USA, China, or any of the main European countries aren‚Äôt even in the top 10 in percent of citizens who use crypto. Here‚Äôs a quick list of the top 10 at the end of 2022:

1. Thailand ‚Äì 20.1%
2. Nigeria ‚Äì 19.4%
3. Philippines ‚Äì 19.4%
4. Turkey ‚Äì 18.6%
5. Argentina ‚Äì 18.5%
6. Indonesia ‚Äì 16.4%
7. Brazil ‚Äì 16.1%
8. Singapore ‚Äì 15.6%
9. South Korea ‚Äì 13.4% 
10. Malaysia ‚Äì 13.2%

Inflation was the driving factor to people leaving their local currency using btc, eth, and tether as savings vehicles.

But let‚Äôs not get ahead of ourselves just yet, the trading volumes in most of those countries are just a fraction of what the USA, Japan, and China does. Here are the top 10 countries with the most trading volume per 24 hours at end of 2022 in USD:

1. USA
2. Japan
3. South Korea
4. Hong Kong
5. Singapore
6. China
7. Australia
8. Canada
9. United Kingdom 
10. Switzerland

One difference between the countries on this list was that the major reason for buying crypto was for investment purposes. Fun fact: in Singapore, Ethereum is slightly more popular than Bitcoin in trading volumes. Also interesting that El Salvador isn‚Äôt on this list but I have a feeling they are on both by now. The trading volume in the USA was only 47% higher than japan which is something to think about if you believe the USA is miles ahead of everyone in crypto trading and adoption. While the USA doesn‚Äôt have the highest % of citizens using crypto, many institutional investors admit they are just waiting for the green light to begin pouring billions into the sector. 

What I have come to believe is that clear and concise laws and regulations will spark the next bull market. As of now, the rule of the land of DCA mainly into btc and eth still stands and a wave of crisp regulations and sticky inflation especially in third world countries will lead crypto back to all time highs. Bitcoin and Ethereum still dominate in countries where inflation is rampant and also in countries where investors are looking for a place to park extra cash. I believe once the USA sets the world stage for crypto adoption, all the others will fall into place and it will make 2021 look like a small blip on the charts. 

Tldr: once the SEC makes things clear over the next year, crypto goes boom aligned perfectly with the next halving cycle."

7/3/23,Most recent yearly inflationrate for different cryptos and their gain/loss in rank. Can your staking rewards keep up?,"Part of crypto I really like it getting some passive incom. Some coins really offer high staking/lending rewards but a good thing to keep in mind is the **inflationrate** of that coin.  
The Inflation of a coin is the rate at which it is currently increasing its supply every year. In some cases this is a negative number, this means the supply is decreasing instead.

I compared the Circulating Supply of March (6th) 2022 and March 2023 (5th), to find the coin's yearly inflationrate:   Inflation Rate % = (2022 Supply / 2023 Supply ) - 1  


&#x200B;

[Yearly inflationrate March 2022 - March 2023](https://preview.redd.it/xqem5fy8qama1.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bd27ba728a4ba1890e9668ca0cfb1beff3fca43f)

With a simple Google search I added the staking/lending rewards you could get for each coin/token.  
The rewards can be (much) higher if you give it some effort, but I still think these numbers are good to compare them with the inflationrate. 

&#x200B;

The ranking of cryptocurrencies is done by market capitalization, the total value of a coin.  
Looking at the current top 200 coins, the ones with the highest yearly inflationrate really did well in gaining a lower rank (and higher market capitalization):  


[Highest and lowest yearly inflationrate \(of top 200\)](https://preview.redd.it/wm0mk5itrama1.png?width=256&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=757197598e6061456f9cf63352e8fa1c5a94ebe0)

In the first table it might look like a high inflationrate = more likely to lose rank; but on average coins that gained rank have a much higher yearly inflationrate than coins that lost rank. Coins with inflationrate of 0 (like DOGE/CRO) have an average loss in rank of -17, which is slightly better than coins with a negative inflationrate.

With this insight I'm a bit more interested in coins with 0 inflationrate and less scared of a high inflationrate because those coins can perform really well.

Do you care about inflationrate when you are staking your fav coin?"

7/3/23,Bear Markets only shuffle out those who don't understand the long-term value of Bitcoin.,"When a bear market comes and the prices start dropping further and bleeding, most of the people panic and sell, but of those who do, it's mostly people who don't understand or did not believe in Bitcoins value long-term, having only entered the market for quick gains. And, as is not surprising, as soon as they are unsuccessful in trading or short term investing, they panic and sell. 


The real value of Bitcoin isn't in its short-term value, not in its ability to make you quick money, but as an asset and it's long-term value. 

When these eleople panic and sell, so do others who are not so sure about Bitcoin, which creates a crash in the market, leaving only people who really do believe in Bitcoins value a long-term asset. 

Biggest names in the industry like MicroStrategy, Galaxy Digital, Blackrock, and others keep buying Bitcoin, which goes on to show that instutional players believe in Bitcoin long-term, and the involvement of instutional investment has kept its constancy for the last 6 years.


It might be hard to hold when you see such prices, but if you do believe in Crypto , it's best to have patience and to invest wisely, which also means to choose your coins wisely."

I think Bitcoin and Etherium are the game changers of the space, but my reasoning for holding them is more in the belief that as the population gets older more and more kids will have either a) watched crypto go through many major bull runs and want in on future events. Or b) Have crypto be in the mainstream media for long enough and see it in financial headlines etc that it becomes seen as a more viable way to make money. 

I think the population that is afraid of investing in it is being replaced by people who were 12-16 when these bull runs were happening and are finally working and able to take part. So the main reason I am investing is to be able to sell to them when they get back involved, only to repeat this cycle endlessly. 

Am I alone here?"

7/3/23,Why Financial Freedom is so important,"After 38 years on this planet, I cannot emphasize enough the importance of achieving financial freedom.

I've been through it all. I've worked for over 20 years in the private sector with different roles in different industries.

I've busted my ass off for years doing hard and honest work, and have always ended up with scraps in the end.

I've done my duty rightously, always producing the very best results in everything I do, including preventing numerous tefts in the Retail sector as a Middle Manager, and escorting drug addicts and pedophiles from an amusement park as a Security Guard.

I've had 3 death threats over the years of work on top of being bullied as a kid and teenager in every city I've moved to with my mom.

Still, I've been prevailing and succeeding all of my life, getting an MBA from the best Business school in my country, and finally ended up as an Entrepreneur with three companies and as an Investor.

I've even volunteered for free, helping the most economic vulnurable people in my city, as with everybody else with my experience, insight, and knowledge.

With all the shit that I've been through in my life, I sometimes question why I bother but I guess it's just becaue it's the right thing to do regardless of what I've been through.

But it just isn't enough. And when I look back, and despite the fact that you are always getting taken for granted no matter how much you give of yourself, I've also realized I've been screwed over so many times by ""friends"", peers and coworkers, and found out time and time again that the world is indeed corrupt.

Now, I've done my very best all the way throughout my life to do the right thing and NOT ending up corrupt, while I've simountaonluysly have called out corrupt people ALL the time, doing my very best to tell and warn normal every day people what is REALLY going on behind the scenes so they don't end up screwing themselves.

I think that's one of the most honorable things you can do, and I never regret attacking those who deserve it, the people who are in positions they really do NOT belong and which they abuse, while hard-working, honest, and competent people are left on the side-line like some big joke.

And so, if you look past my achievements, my biggest achievment of them all is actually the fact that I'm still an honest man who sleeps good at night. And that my friends, is priceless!

These days, I seriously question if I will have that luxury much longer UNLESS I end up becoming financially independent, so that I can protect my character, integrity, and dignity.

And as a Strategist, that's exactly what's going to happen, as I've already planned my financial freedom years ago. Thus, the next bull run will be awesome.

Starting to invest was the best decision I've ever made, and I sincerely wish I started much sooner, as well as taking bigger risk from the get go.

There is no other way to secure your peace of mind and to escape the rat race once and for all. If you have to work for others, make sure it is not a dead in job and a job that is both sustainable now and in the future.

Otherwise, you can only go so long before you're screwed again. Take it from me, I've been there time and time again and it never ever ends.

If there's anything worth fighting for in this world, it is your independence, self-reliance, freedom, and peace of mind. The only one you can truly trust in this world is yourself, nobody else.

This is why I can't emphasize the importance of achieving financial freedom enough, and the sooner you start, the better. I even wrote a long article about it which I published on my company website years ago. It's that important.

Because with financial freedom, you can do whatever the hell you want. You don't need to pretend anymore, and you don't need to play silly games with other people either. You can play your own damn game and rule the world as you please.

And so, I hope everyone (who deserves it) end up in that beautiful place one day. Life is just too short to bust your ass off for nothing.

Your time and energy is the most valuable thing in the world. Do NOT waste it on others, only yourself!"

He had just started learning about crypto, like many people, he watched YouTube influencers, and he wanted to invest. I told him that it was not the right time as we were entering a bear market (Jan 2022), but did he listen? No.

His brother shared an influencer with him who said to invest in the metaverse. I told him not to listen to influencers because they have their own agenda, but he didn't listen. I also advised him not to invest in low-cap shitcoins at this time since 99% won't survive (unless they are MOONS, of course). But he saw a lot of videos, and now he's a crypto expert - it only took him two months to learn what it takes others years.

In Feb last year, he told me that he bought a few metaverse projects, and the only one I remember was BLOK. I knew what it was - a shitty metaverse project that focused on advertising crap like a billboard of BitBoy in a cyberpunk hub (red flag already). I told him that it was probably one of the worst projects to invest in, but he didn't listen. He lost almost all his money because he didn't listen.

 At least it was a life lesson: two months of YouTube videos doesn't make you a crypto expert.

Do you have friends that stupid or is just me?"

I'm new to crypto and honestly had no idea what BCH is and what chaintip is.

7/3/23,Every seen a Casascius coin? They‚Äôre physical bitcoins - and there‚Äôs still plenty of unredeemed ones out there,"Most users who‚Äôve been around here long know about physical bitcoins, but there‚Äôs definitely some newer folks who don‚Äôt. In the earlier days of crypto, these actual coins were created and sold by Bitcoin enthusiast Mike Caldwell from 2011-2013, until the government informed him that he wasn‚Äôt allowed to mint his own physical currencies. They‚Äôre still available for sale on secondary markets. Mike worked with a mint to manufacture the coins, and each was distinguishable by its gold or silver appearance and a Bitcoin ‚ÄòB‚Äô, as well as the printed value of Bitcoin accessible with the coin (1-1000 BTC increments) over a few different series. The coins could be shared/spent physically, or, to access the digital currency and permanently move it to a crypto wallet, you could break the coin open and remove its hologram component to access the paper redemption code. There were also some denominations minted each series as a bar rather than a coin.


According to one on the trackers for Casascius coins, [Casascius Tracker](https://casasciustracker.com/status/), there‚Äôs a pretty large amount of these coins that have never been redeemed - ie, never been moved to an alternate wallet. Of 675 series 1 coins valued at 5 BTC, there‚Äôs still 440 that aren‚Äôt redeemed. There are still 335 unredeemed series 2 coins of a 10 BTC denomination. The list goes on. Now some of these coins are definitely in the possession of collectors - after all, if they don‚Äôt plan to sell the BTC, they can simply hold the Casascius coin unredeemed, confident in its value and safety. However - this can‚Äôt account for all of them. Some of the physical coins may have been lost to time or memory. But you can never be sure when or where they may turn up. It‚Äôs a little late to get in on buying Bitcoin at 2011 prices, but be aware of what these coins look like in case you ever come across one at a goodwill store, garage sale, estate sale, and so on. Happy hunting."

Now with their lighting fast fall from grace, it seems that previously crypto unfriendly politicians have put tons of pressure on the SEC to act‚Ä¶.and boy are they *ever*. 

They aren‚Äôt just trying to pick on the LBRY‚Äôs of the world anymore, but they are looking at **Binance** and **Grayscale**, two of the giants in the space. I think a lot of people including myself were very happy to see another scam laden crypto institution get the justice it deserved. However, the unintended consequence is a much more aggressive SEC and sadly it looks that due to the climate in the US, the crypto industry may look to move outside of the US.  

As a US citizen my hope is that common sense crypto laws are passed that put restraint on fraud but still allow for the advancement of the industry, but until I see momentum moving in that direction, I have my doubts. What do you think?"

It just doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôve played numerous P2E games and for the most of them it‚Äôs not worth the time. I don‚Äôt wanna say which ones, so it doesn‚Äôt look like I‚Äôm promoting them. 


Right now, I believe most of the people that play these are in for the money. In harsh reality, you‚Äôre probably gonna make a decent amount of money only if you‚Äôre at the very beginning of the game development, and even then it‚Äôs risky. I‚Äôm gonna go over several points in this post, starting from the most important one:


**Gameplay**


All the games I‚Äôve seen, at least 95% of them are just a copy of whatever just exists + token. I didn‚Äôt find a single one that made me go ‚ÄúWow, that‚Äôs so original actually.‚Äù Granted, the gaming space is flooded with all types of unique games where at this point it‚Äôs harder to come up with something original, but if we want to see the adoption of crypto games, it‚Äôs necessary for them to stand out. Sucks to see that many are low quality products designed for a quick buck in this still fresh space. The only unique thing that stands out is the token I guess, but that just brings a whole new problem‚Ä¶


**The Tokenomics**


I just don‚Äôt like it, at all. It‚Äôs not a sustainable model, especially in games that don‚Äôt excite you a bit. The whole purpose is to reinvest back into the game, though the obvious thing that happens is that only the sell pressure is present, at least in the most cases. In the most projects I‚Äôve seen the token dipped faster than the new dogeelonmoon shitcoin. Combine this model of business with the players that only want to cash out and you have yourself a ticking timing bomb.


**The Future of P2E**


Right now, it won‚Äôt lead anywhere in my opinion. New projects are being made all the time, but how long will it last, I don‚Äôt know. Drastic changes need to be done in order for this type of model to succeed, but as a gamer, it doesn‚Äôt excite me. I would rather play a quality game to relax myself and earn nothing than play a game that is a chore playing and only feels like a job to earn few cents a day.

7/3/23,"The Howey Test is Used to Determine Securities, Not Gary Gensler","Gary recently had an interview with New York Magazine and he's quoted saying that everything else other than Bitcoin is a security. If this is true, then we are on the horizon of a lot of enforcement action and a lot of violations by many crypto projects that we're trying to do things on the right side of the law.

It's pretty apparent to myself as a tax attorney and in working in the crypto industry, that not all crypto other than Bitcoin are securities. So, this is definitely a misleading statement and hopefully retracted in the future. Although Gary said this, it's yet to be seen if this will be considered an official statement of the SEC.

This could could be very devastating to the crypto industry because the SEC has very wide enforcement authority. After the fall of FTX, most people expected additional government enforcement and regulation, but what we're seeing today is enforcement but no clarity on regulation. 

What this means is that it will be much more difficult for new projects to create technology and try to stay on the right side of the law because there is no clear regulation. And instead we just have examples of what happens when you do things wrong and the SEC goes after you.

OFAC stands for Office of Foreign Assets Control. It‚Äôs a financial intelligence and enforcement agency of the U.S. Treasury Department. It administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions in support of U.S. national security and foreign policy objectives.

6/3/23,Is Crypto really as bad as they make it seem?,"Crypto gets a bad rep. It‚Äôs new, and it‚Äôs disturbing the traditional ways of finance. They throw a lot big number out there, but is it really so bad? 

Let‚Äôs take a look:

Crypto scammers took a whopping 14 billion dollars from investors in 2021. According to CNBC 

10-14 billion dollars worth of crypto was used to fund crime and other illegal activities. According to various news articles.

That‚Äôs pretty bad‚Ä¶

We probably shouldn‚Äôt put our money in crypto because it‚Äôs all a big scam and its only used to fund criminal activity. Right?

Let‚Äôs take a look at some of the fiat numbers that effect all of us. 

Wage theft - 50 Billion - Employers not paying proper wages to their workers - according to globe and mail.  Rich business owners are literally stealing from their hard working employees. 

Money laundering that funds criminal activity - 800 billion to 2 trillion according to The United Nations office on drugs and crime. 

Mutual Fund Fees 1 trillion - 4.3 trillion ( no source, calculated myself)

Credit card interest payments - 120 billion - consumer finance. 

The list goes on and on. 

These numbers aren‚Äôt perfect, and likely aren‚Äôt accurate but it‚Äôs the only info I can get my hands on. 

As adoption increases the crypto numbers will go up as well, but as of right now, crypto is looking pretty good."

The following does not apply if you strongly believe in a project right now and are still fully convinced. However, if you bought without good research or things changed since your purchase (the project, not the price) you should be aware of this:

The sunken cost fallacy. This is a common mistake people make when they continue to invest in something because they've already put so much time or money into it, even if it no longer makes sense to do so. In the world of crypto, this can be a dangerous trap to fall into.
Just because you've invested a lot of money in a particular cryptocurrency, it doesn't mean you should continue to hold onto it if it's not performing well. Don't let the fear of losing your initial investment prevent you from making rational decisions about your current holdings.

Ask yourself: Would I buy this right now? If not, then it's probably a good idea to sell and invest the money elsewhere. Just because you lost, doesn't mean you can't lose more... And it also doesn't mean you can't make your money back elsewhere. Projects change and you should re-evaluate your stance regularly.
Take a step back and reassess the situation objectively. Consider the current state of the market and the potential future of the currency in question. If it's not looking good, it might be time to cut your losses and move on.
Remember, the sunk cost fallacy can lead to even bigger losses in the long run. Don't let your emotions cloud your judgment and always make informed decisions based on the current state of the market.

TL;DR: Diamond hands are a dangerous meme. Hold on to your stuff and DCA if you are convinced. But be brave enough to change your opinion if the situation changes."

I'm trying to understand what they mean by an asset held for longer than 365 days.

Then what about staking? say you're staking ETH on Rocketpool. Are you supposed to pay 30% tax each month for one year if you withdraw your earnings and after that you no-longer need to pay tax on it, or the staking earnings are 'new' and so you'd always need to pay tax on it but wouldn't need to pay tax if you stopped staking and cashed out the original asset?

and this guide will go in depth on how do u disable it and enable 2 factor authentication through mobile:

1) Click on the user icon at top left corner and go into security

2) You will see 4 options for authentication , i had email and mobile ones set up

3) So to enable Google authentication , just click on that icon and they will give  a slide tutorial and then they will share a key , copy that key and paste it in google authenticator by clicking on the plus sign in the bottom.

4)Now they will ask you to re - login into your bianance account , do that and voila you are done setting up your google authenticator !

5)Now the last step is to disable the SMS 2FA , for that go to the security like we did in step one ,click on SMS/Phone number authentication and toggle it off, they ask you to enter all your OTPs , do that and re login 

&#x200B;

Now your account is a tad bit safer than before , These small things can later on become the source of a big loss for us , so it is better to be safe than sorry.

7/3/23,Can Layer 2-3 Solutions on Bitcoin Compromise Its Decentralization?,"Bitcoin has long been hailed as a decentralized cryptocurrency that is resistant to censorship and control by any centralized entity. However, as the technology around Bitcoin evolves, new layer 2-3 solutions are being developed that allow for additional functionalities, such as smart contracts, tokenization, and other forms of programmability.

The question is, can these layer 2-3 solutions compromise Bitcoin's fundamental decentralization? After all, these solutions are built on top of Bitcoin, but they are not an integral part of the Bitcoin protocol itself.

One concern is that these layer 2-3 solutions are often developed by centralized entities, which goes against the decentralized ethos of Bitcoin. For example, many tokenization platforms built on top of Bitcoin are owned and operated by a single entity, which means that this entity has significant control over the platform and its users.

Another concern is that layer 2-3 solutions can introduce security vulnerabilities that can compromise the security of the Bitcoin network as a whole. This is because these solutions often require users to trust centralized entities to handle transactions and other functions. If these centralized entities are compromised, then the entire system can be compromised as well.

That being said, there are also layer 2-3 solutions that have been designed with decentralization in mind. For example, the Lightning Network is a layer 2 solution that allows for fast and cheap Bitcoin transactions without relying on a centralized entity. Instead, it uses a network of nodes that work together to route transactions.

In summary, while it is possible to build layer 2-3 solutions on top of Bitcoin, there are concerns that these solutions could compromise the decentralization and security of the network. It's essential to carefully evaluate each solution and the entity behind it before using it.

What are your thoughts on this topic? Do you think layer 2-3 solutions compromise the decentralization of Bitcoin?"

7/3/23,SEC accuses Utah firm of 'fraudulent' $18M crypto mining scheme By Cointelegraph,
7/3/23,Bankruptcy courts/judges can finally start to understand how uncooperative regulators are,"Bankruptcy court in crypto is a shitshow. There is no insurance, precedent, or regulatory clarity. You stand by while a carcass gets picked apart *hoping* someone is competent/rich enough to come to your rescue. An equally frustrating part of it is regulators getting involved. Take for example the Voyager hearing earlier and ill highlight some of the things that stood out having the SEC at the table with their very obvious vendetta against Binance, who are trying to process their bid and *save Voyager customers*.

The SEC has objected to the plan to sell to Binance US because they believe there are *potential* securities law violations. The judge got pissed because they havent made any specific allegations, and want to hold up the process of the sale while ‚Äúdeliberately avoiding taking a position‚Äù. He made it clear without specifics he has to proceed with best business interest for creditors and not going to piss away money so the SEC can continue to ‚Äúhang over heads‚Äù. The big argument seems to be VGX token, but Voyager claims they sent the SEC VGX paperwork in **2021** and never heard back.

They also stated that ‚Äúthey dont know‚Äù what would happen if VGX was deemed a security, and that Binance is actually an ‚Äúillegal securities exchange‚Äù which is quite the bombshell‚Ä¶lol. The judge said ‚Äúthe world cant wait for Congress to make its mind up‚Äù about crypto and they need to move on. 

The UCC, judge, and Voyager lawyers absolutely aired out these regulator lawyers basically attempting to do a mafia-style *something bad may happen to you* while they were trying to get people‚Äôs life savings back. It just goes to show that the SEC will do everything including bankrupting their own citizens to keep the pressure on crypto.

It‚Äôs interesting to see a microcosm of the issues at large play out in a bankruptcy court. The same looming questions everyone has except speed run version. I hope Voyager/FTX/Celsius can highlight how fucked these people are and i hope Congress is paying attention to this circus paid by the people ‚Äúfor the people‚Äù"

7/3/23,Judges consider Grayscale's arguments in Bitcoin ETF hearing against SEC,
7/3/23,"If I create fake silver coins to rip people off, does that mean real silver coins need more regulation?","Doesn't make sense does it?

Now apply that to cryptocurrency.  Rugpulls, and scamcoins are really just illegitimate cryptocurrency.   Creating them has nothing to do with real legitimate coins such as BTC, LTC, ETH etc.  

If a new online Precious metals exchange opens up in a country you don't live in, and you decided to buy silver from them only to find out you got scammed, what does this have to do with actual silver coins? 

What would regulation have to do to prevent someone from being scammed of their crypto?   Absolutely nothing.  The only thing they an do is make it illegal to buy them.

###High end sports cars

A dealership by me about 10-15 years ago got caught using them to launder money for drug dealers. 

Does that now mean Ferrari, and Porche now need to be regulated more?


Holy shit , this is like a revelation in thought.  Why didn't millions of people who agree with regulation and also don't own crypto think of this?

Because they don't know any better themselves. They hear Bad things, and some authority telling them this is the reason.    They don't actually have independent mind frame enough to conceive these thoughts on a regular basis.

Regulate and control are synonyms, and setting rules and standards is a form of control that can guide and shape behavior. 

The argument that cryptocurrency needs to be regulated because of scams is not a valid reason to condemn the idea or usage of cryptocurrency. 

What crypto needs is more security.   A way to control your crypto yourself.    Oh Jesus. That's the whole idea of cryptocurrency.  To be your own bank.  

One more example. Just for entertainment purposes.

If you leave valuable items laying around in some other place.   A unopened PS5, a gold chain worth $5,000, and Valuable autograph sports cards worth $20K, and that gets stolen .   I guess that means the PS5, gold, and sports cards need more regulation so this doesn't happen again.   That will prevent people from being victims of a crime and it will increase the intelligence of everyone who owns such items so they won't do anything stupid again."

Some estimates say **more than a third of the world population, or 2.88 billion people** watch anime.

# How Anime and Crypto can work together and the benefits.

\-I am not a specialist economist and I do not have any financial background but I will do my best and explain what I think might be a good thing for both industries.

&#x200B;

\-Anime Studios and Mangaka(manga creators) would see their net worth grow by a lot. Using Nfts for their Manga and Anime best and most famous moments, characters, places, etc. A lot of fans would buy them in a heartbeat. Nfts of rocks had been sold for an absurd amount of money just imagine how much anime NFTs would sell.

&#x200B;

\-Sell merchandise, manga, anime characters, toys, clothes, etc in crypto. Accepting payments in crypto. It would make it easier for the merchandise to get purchased without banks in between. They would eventually observe more growth in customers. 

&#x200B;

\-Wider global audience reach, more and more people in the industry.

&#x200B;

\-Advertisements and promotion

&#x200B;

\-It could also help on preventing the counterfeiting of Manga, (I know that outside Japan most people read Manga online) but still it would be definitely good for the industry.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What about crypto? how it would help crypto.

&#x200B;

\-More use cases more utility.

\-Tapping into an Industry that is watched by  **2.88 billion people. Far greater market reach.**

\-Market growth and increased adoption, eventually more people will get interested in crypto, and market growth will be inevitable. 

\-New investment opportunities

\-Innovation

\-Advertisments and promotion 

&#x200B;

Last but not least it could create a utopia for people who are both anime and crypto fans and also bring closer the fans from the two different industries who are not fans of each other. That's just my silly humble opinion.

This is indicative of the thought on this sub, held by probably the majority of people, that coins either use PoW or PoS as their consensus mechanism. However, I want to show you how 'Open Representative Voting' (ORV) is actually another option that is distinct from PoS, although admittedly similar.

**Disclaimer: Although I own Nano, I'm not arguing for ORV over PoS, I'm just showing how the two are different.**

[From the Nano documentation website](https://docs.nano.org/protocol-design/orv-consensus/), the differences between ORV and PoS are:

* There is not one monolithic blockchain that requires leader selection (i.e. a staker or a miner) to extend
* Representatives do not create or produce shared blocks (groups of transactions)
* Each Nano account has its own blockchain that only the owner can modify (representatives can only modify their own blockchain)
* In Nano, a block is a single transaction (not a group of transactions). Transactions are evaluated individually and asynchronously
* Users can remotely re-delegate their voting weight to anyone at any time
* Anyone can be a representative
* No funds are staked or locked up
* Representatives do not earn transaction fees
* Representatives cannot reverse transactions that nodes have locally confirmed (due to [block cementing](https://docs.nano.org/glossary#cementing)).

**Tl;dr Nano uses ORV and not PoS. They are very similar, but still distinct, consensus mechanisms.**"

Thierry Baudet is a 40 year old Dutch right-wing politician, author, and (self-declared) conspiracy theorist. He is the founder and leader of the political party Forum for Democracy (FvD) and a member of the house of representatives (""Tweede Kamer"") since 2017. 

FvD has the highest party membership numbers of any political party in the Netherlands, although the  numbers have been disputed. FvD used to be a top 2 political party in the Netherlands, yet lost some votes in recent years, due to a range of controversies. He is a very polarizing figure, similar to Trump and Boris Johnson.

# The Bitcoin mining plan

In a speech earlier this month in preperation for Dutch elections, Thierry Baudet said that he wanted the government to dedicate a coal plant to mine Bitcoin. so the Netherlands could become a Bitcoin hub of the world. Then Bitcoin could serve as a sort of secondary gold reserve for the Dutch. He argues that this would be a serious way to foster the prosperity of the Netherlands.

# Thierry Baudet's Bitcoin history

Back in 2018, Thierry Baudet already said that he would like to work around FIAT money with Bitcoin, as bitcoin could help the Dutch get out of the according to him disastrous Euro and the plans of the ECB, the European Central Bank.

Is it legally allowable to any extent to account for those by manually adding a reconciliation trade if you disclose that to the tax reporting agency?  Does it require a licensed tax professional to execute?   They are called ""synthetic trades"" by some.    For example, if you know you bought BTC sometime in 2016 on an exchange which has closed, you may be able to use the lowest price for that year as your cost basis, i.e. be maximally conservative.  Or as some have had problems with Binance Futures fees or other fees not being reported, would this be a way to account for those?    Has anyone had any experience with using these and what outcome?  Just add a trade in your tax software, and then disclose it as an addendum to your list of trades (8949 in U.S.)?  A detailed blockchain analysis will likely result of your wallets and transfers, so it would require 100% provable justification, and may require a licensed tax preparer to perform.

7/3/23,They‚Äôre still trying to ban cryptography,
7/3/23,Governments should regulate the CEX aspect of Crypto and the Crypto community needs to do the same for DeFi aspect and both parties should accept that.,"There is a lot of talk, gossip and FUD around regulations in cryptocurrency and obviously a topic that is gaining more and more traction especially after we have witnessed some bloodbath scenarios last year with Do Kwon's failed Luna experiment and the mighty rise and downfall of SBFs FTX that triggered a shockwave across the entire crypto space. 

Regulations are needed, everyone who is long enough in this knows this and accepts this. Now the problems seems to be who is regulating what and both governments and crypto communities get really confused here, some for a reason and some are just playing dumb. 

As a regular crypto user, I really don't care much about the centralized part of cryptocurrency. The sheer number of CEXs that failed is staggering and I just don't have any trust in them. The main reason why I fell in love in crypto in the first place is because of decentralization in the blockchain and the possibilities that it creates and one of the better ones is the fact that I am in control for all my interactions and transactions with the blockchain without having any middleman in between, especially not one that is centralized. 

Both CEX and DEX worlds are facing the same problems: Scammers, security issues, money laundering, wash trading etc. We can name them all day and they are very serious and are getting more and more traction in the recent years.

As it is with traditional finance, all CEXs that are currently operating should fall under the jurisdiction of governments that have the responsibility to regulate and to protect the end user and investor. For me personally, I, as a crypto user, don't have anything to add here or suggest as a regulation, as I treat centralized exchanges as private owned companies which I am not the owner of. 

On the other hand, the opposite happens with DeFi and the DEXs. It is a part of a wide decentralized network, and I am a partial owner of it and a part of the wider community that is keeping it alive. 

Therefore, we as community have the responsibility to protect the end user/investor and regulate it in order to make it fair and secure for everyone. Because its not a private or centralized network, the government can only be a part of the wider community and not have the right to control and decide how and when to regulate the DeFi space as a whole."

7/3/23,hear me out. Manipulation?,"Crypto and especialy BTC are populare for a good few years now. It has attracted attention from people/firms/goverments. Would you say there is a way for those big bag holders to buy very much at once, making the coin more scarce/valueble and how long for this value to show on the charts. Would it be an immediate pump within a few seconds? We Fomo, they wait a few more for us to drop more money in and they can just dump it on us?

Why I ask this is because BTC and ETH were stable on 16K or sum for over a year or whatever and suddenly it pumped to 22K and do fuck all after that again. Those sudden Big pumps or drops need to be significant money, hasnt it? 
Its always BTC and ETH that pump or drop the same percentage at the same time, every time.

Whats more likely is that the world starts seeing lightning as the one global payments protocol for sending and recieving payments. Lightning infrastructure companies all over the world will start helping existing financial apps and point of sale service providers to integrate with lightning so that any app whether that be cashapp paypal wise or your local payments app and banking apps will be able to send to lightning and recieve from lightning while every point of sale and ecommerce solution will be able to recieve to lightning invoices.

Once this happens every app in every country will be able to pay any other app in any other country including point of sale devices and ecommerce checkouts and for the first time in human history the worlds financial system will finally be interoperable and easy to use on a global scale.

Most people wont know what bitcoin or lightning is, all they will know is their app can now send to any other app and pay to any merchant on earth online or in person. 

This seems like the logical progression. Maybe in 10 or 20 years everyone will hold their balances in sats too because of fiat currency depreciation but in the near term it is the lightning network that will proliferate around the world and become one of the worlds strongest network effects we have ever seen. Any app or bank or merchant that isnt plugged into lightning will be left behind.

The cherry on top is that as lightning gains its unstoppable network effects and proliferates around the world anyone with a simple lightning wallet holding some sats will be able to fully integrate into that system being able to send and recieve to any person and any merchant on earth. Thats the ultimate goal. Lightning is the trojan horse that will put bitcoin at the very center of the worlds new financial system.

So I have stopped asking the question when will merchants accept bitcoin and have started asking the question how long until the existing payments infrastructure plugs into lightning. Network effects are strong and network effects for payments are far stronger than any social network, afterall payments are far more important to people than facebook. So it is highly likely that by 2030 the entire worlds financial apps and point of sale solutions will all be integrated with the lightning network.

Critical mass for the lightning network may start once a handful of banks or point of sale service providers have integrated in 10 or 20 of the largest nations. At that point the network effect of payments will see lightning go mainstream extremely quickly. We have already seen xapo private bank integrate lightning and blackhawk POS service provider in the US integrate lightning. By 2025 we may have reached critical mass escape velocity and between 2025 and 2030 lightning will spread around the world until it is used by absolutely every financial app and point of sale terminal on earth."
7/3/23,"How the IMF over-exploits developing nations, and why El Salvador adopting Bitcoin as Legal Tender might help to break this cycle in the future","This is somewhat of a long essay. A TL;DR is at the end.

It is known to everyone that the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as well as the World Bank, lends money to developing nations. It turns out that the interest these nations pay does not come only in the form of a premium on the amount they borrowed. What are the other determinants? The contract clauses these nations have to sign. We'll get back to these shortly.

The general aspect of the situation was summed up in a [piece](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2021/5/6/rich-countries-drained-152tn-from-the-global-south-since-1960) by J. Hickel, visiting scholar at the London School of Economics, and others:

&#x200B;

>Rich countries have a monopoly on decision-making in the World Bank and IMF, they hold most of the bargaining power in the World Trade Organization, they use their power as creditors to dictate economic  policy in debtor nations, and they control 97 percent of the world‚Äôs patents.

# The contracts have conditionality clauses that forbid borrowers from investing in their own development

Argentina has been a huge borrower from the IMF. The crisis they had in 2001 was partially due to their IMF binding clauses: they were told to cut government spending on specific areas, such as health, education and security. The IMF provided another set of loans and measures to enforce this would be paid. Amongst this:

* Argentina was forced to concentrate its economy on exports, therefore preventing the local market to develop industries such as microchip ones, as well as to open its market to the rest of the world. This resulted in a fair amount of local companies closing their doors, as they could not compete with the global market;
* Being forced to repay the loans and without the possibility to do so, they were forced to take even more loans, undermining their capacity to feed people.

Ghana also borrowed many times from the IMF. A period of loans goes between 1983-2006. The austerity measures required by the IMF included cutting funds for the National Health Fund (NHF), which funds the public healthcare service. This was supposedly with the excuse of having its money back. Between 2008 and 2009 alone, the allocation of resources to the NHF fell by **40%** (48% if inflation is taken into account). This caused citizens to be left without proper healthcare service, overworked professionals and lack of material for medical procedures.

Another conditionality for Ghana's loan was that the government should delay payment to domestic suppliers. In addition to that, no investment projects were performed in 2009 due to the austerity measures. As a very detailed [report](https://actionaid.org/sites/default/files/implications_of_imf_loans_and_conditionalities_on_the_poor_and_vulnerable_in_ghana.pdf) on the matter writes:

>\[...\] since no new opportunities are opened up by way of award of new contracts as a result of IMF conditionalities, laborers, artisans, food sellers and their households are badly hit \[...\]  
>  
>GoG increase in electricity tariffs upon advice of the IMF has hit the vulnerable and the poor hardest. For instance, in June 2010, the Public Utility Regulatory Commission (PURC) proposed average increase of 89 percent and 36 per cent in electricity and water tariffs respectively. Therefore, the steep increases in the utility tariffs imply that this was a condition that needed to be met in order for the government to get other tranche of the loan.

The non-comprehensive list of examples is vast: Greece, Brazil, Venezuela, Peru, Chile, Mexico, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Nigeria, Lebanon, Tunisia, Turkey, Morocco, Jordan. Another [piece](https://www.africason.com/2014/08/imf-and-world-bank-neo-colonial-tool-to.html) states that

>In Lebanon, debt service accounts for 47 percent of the government's budget. **Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia and Turkey all spend more on debt service than they do  on education**; all spend twice as much on debt service than they do on  health care.

# Have the aids failed?

To the countries that borrowed, yes. To the lenders, no. A [scientific paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13563467.2021.1899153) from 2021 quantified the damages of unequal exchanges between the Global South (GS) and the Global North (GN). The TL;DR is

>Over the whole period, drain from the South totaled $62 trillion  (constant 2011 dollars), or **$152 trillion** when accounting for lost  growth.  
>  
>\[...\]  
>  
>**For every dollar of aid the South receives, they lose $14 in drain through unequal exchange alone, not counting other kinds of losses like  illicit financial outflows and profit repatriation**

These unequal exchanges can be understood with a simple analogy: if the minimum wage in a certain country is 2x less than in e.g. the US, this country needs to spend twice as much to import goods from the US, whereas the US only pays half as much to import the same amount of goods. In addition to that, there's no fair fight when discussing international monetary policies, according to J. Hickel:

>**Rich countries have a monopoly on decision-making in the World Bank and IMF**, they hold most of the bargaining power in the World Trade Organization, they use their power as creditors to dictate economic policy in debtor nations, and they control 97 percent of the world‚Äôs patents.

Another difficult aspect is that **the IMF loans money to the very group of people that put this or that country in economic distress**. From here on, the clauses contribute to a snowball of bad decisions that lead population to suffer and to always be hostage of international policies.

# El Salvador adopting Bitcoin as Legal Tender might help to break the cycle

To start with, El Salvador only invested around 1% of its Treasury into Bitcoin. It's unlikely they'll face bankruptcy on that or that they will default on their debts, as advertised North and South by traditional media outlets. That being said, the IMF was adamant and made many attacks on El Salvador due to its adoption of Bitcoin as a Legal Tender:

[El Salvador president's bitcoin push casts shadow over IMF efforts](https://www.reuters.com/technology/el-salvador-presidents-bitcoin-push-casts-shadow-over-imf-efforts-2021-06-07/)

[World Bank rejects El Salvador request for help on bitcoin implementation](https://www.reuters.com/business/el-salvador-keep-dollar-legal-tender-seeks-world-bank-help-with-bitcoin-2021-06-16/)

[IMF recommends El Salvador not use bitcoin as legal tender](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/imf-recommends-el-salvador-not-use-bitcoin-legal-tender-2021-11-22/)

[Factbox: IMF asks El Salvador to drop bitcoin, more countries clamp down](https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/imf-asks-el-salvador-drop-bitcoin-more-countries-clamp-down-2022-01-26/)

There were even outlets spreading out El Salvador would default on their debt:

[The big default? The dozen countries in the danger zone](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/big-default-dozen-countries-danger-zone-2022-07-15/)

Which, as we know, didn't happen, as they paid their debt in full last month:

https://preview.redd.it/av4rrqoojcma1.png?width=583&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a74b15c78db0f3ed49f39300970628ab0688c859

Some time after the payment, the IMF acknowledged that the experiment did not completely fail:

[IMF says El Salvador's bitcoin risks have not materialized but 'should be addressed'](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/imf-says-el-salvadors-bitcoin-risks-have-not-materialized-should-be-addressed-2023-02-11/)

In a recent document, which was reported in detail by a [post](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/11a401m/international_monetary_fund_released_a_paper/) from another user, the IMF stated that cryptocurrencies should not be used as a Legal Tender, allegedly to ""o safeguard monetary sovereignty and stability"". As discussed yet by other users in the sub, it seems they're simply afraid of other nations following El Salvador's queue. The reasons for that are many, but my main guess is related to the aspects explored in the first part of this post: **if they're not issuing the currency, they don't have control over a nation's monetary policy**.

El Salvador has not disrupted the system yet and is very far from doing so. The danger, however, is that they created a serious precedent. **For the first time in modern history, rich countries can't control nor can they affect the issuing of a developing country's Legal Tender**. Other countries might follow suit. Since all fiat currencies are somewhat tied to the US Dollar, be it by soft power or actual economic deals, this precedent is a serious disruption of the status quo that is in place since 1971.

# There are flaws in El Salvador's Bitcoin adoption, though

It was reported by an actual El Salvadoran redditor (I couldn't find the posts) that the system implemented there has flaws:

* There was no educational period for the population to know what it is
* The control of the wallet's keys are not public, and people don't know who exactly have access to them
* At the end of the day, some places accept it, others don't, it is not a widespread thing

# TL;DR

* The IMF impoverishes developing nations with austerity clauses that forbid them to actually invest in development
* El Salvador is far from ""beating the system"" with Bitcoin, but created a dangerous precedent as other nations might follow suit
* **It's the first time in modern history that the IMF and its affiliates can't control nor can they affect the issuing of a country's Legal Tender.** This might give developing nations more power to break the IMF-dependent loan cycle in the future.

7/3/23,This still blows my mind to this day.,"Imagine there was one thing, one system, one asset, one protocol, one network that was going to take on the role of SWIFT, Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Gold, Silver, and all central banks globally.

Something that was set to displace just one of the above would be wild, but all of them? It is insane that there is one network that is going to disrupt all of the above companies institutions and industries.

And perhaps even more crazy is less than 1% of the world know it yet.

Every year I think we cant possibly still be the early adopters yet every year things happen to make it obvious we are still so early. Most technologies grow exponentially over time but bitcoins real world usage in payments and as money has taken a long time to take off which means in all likelihood it will catch up in a big way and become ubiquitous all at once, going maintmsteam within such a small period of time that it will shock even the biggest believers. Because of the coming interest rate and inflation induced global recession and financial crisis I believe this will happen extremely soon.

We are still so early yet at the same time we are so close to bitcoin proliferating around the world and being used as the worlds reserve currency and main payments network. Just like bitcoins price 90% of the gains happen in 10% of the time, the same will be true of its adoption. 90% of its adoption will happen in 10% of the time.

If it takes bitcoin 20 years to gain mainstream adoption between 2008 and 2028 then dont be surprised when 90% of its adoption takes place within a 2 or 3 year period between 2025 and 2028"

7/3/23,Will Bitcoin's Current Reputation Affect It's Long-Term Mainstream Adoption?,"The amount of people that truly and honestly believe Bitcoin is one giant scam seems to get bigger every single day.

While there were a lot of people that felt skeptical about the internet or any other technological breakthrough, there wasn't the same level of animosity that I see towards Bitcoin. There are a lot of people who are literally angry and see Bitcoin as one giant pyramid scheme that is bound to crash at some point in the future. 

So how will that ""scam"" label associated with Bitcoin vanish so we can eventually have mainstream adoption?

My hypothesis is that Bitcoin will only make sense to the mainstream when CBDCs get introduced and rolled out. It might not be terrifying at first for some people, but the moment people start to realize that their money is being programmed on a case-by-case basis is when everyone will awaken from the dystopian nightmare. It will then be obvious to everyone that Bitcoin is a superior digital currency and people will begin to rush to it as a safe haven asset. It will be seen as a form of digital gold or even cash. I always think of how much my dad LOVES cash - why? Because the government can't track what you do with it. Bitcoin will serve as both the digital gold (long-term savings mechanism) and the digital cash.

7/3/23,Benefits of using a self-directed IRA to hold bitcoin,"If you're interested in investing in bitcoin for your retirement, you might want to consider using a self-directed Individual Retirement Account (IRA) to hold your assets. Here are some benefits of using a self-directed IRA to hold bitcoin:

Tax advantages: With a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, you can enjoy tax benefits such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals. By using a self-directed IRA to hold bitcoin, you can potentially enjoy the same tax benefits while investing in a rapidly growing asset class.

Diversification: Bitcoin is a relatively new asset class, and investing in it can help diversify your retirement portfolio. By holding a portion of your retirement assets in bitcoin, you can potentially reduce the overall risk of your portfolio.

Control: Self-directed IRAs allow you to have more control over your retirement assets. You can choose how much bitcoin to invest in, when to buy or sell, and where to store your assets. This level of control can help you make more informed investment decisions.

Flexibility: With a self-directed IRA, you can invest in a variety of assets beyond traditional stocks and bonds, including bitcoin. This flexibility allows you to customize your retirement portfolio to your specific investment goals and risk tolerance.

Security: By holding bitcoin in a self-directed IRA, you can potentially enjoy greater security than holding it in a personal wallet. Self-directed IRA custodians are regulated by the IRS and must follow strict rules and guidelines to protect your retirement assets.

Of course, investing in bitcoin carries risks, and it's important to do your own research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions. But if you're interested in investing in bitcoin for your retirement, a self-directed IRA could be a powerful tool to help you achieve your financial goals."

This can reduce the  reliance on fossil fuels and decrease the carbon footprint of mining.  Additionally, using more energy-efficient mining hardware and optimizing  the mining process can also help to reduce energy consumption and  increase profitability. Another approach is to join a mining pool, which  allows multiple miners to combine their computing power and share the  rewards. This can increase the chances of earning Bitcoin rewards while  reducing the energy costs of mining for individual miners.

And finally, how this actually worked I mean, can it execute my trade to take a buy and sell signal from Tradingview Indicators? So if you guys know anything about it, kindly explain it to me if you guys have time on your hands.


I really look forward to it because there is very little information about it on the internet.


Thank you."

7/3/23,Brave browser says 11 percent of it's token is in DeFi,"According to a recent report from Brave Browser, more than 11% of their native token, Basic Attention Token (BAT), is actively being used in DeFi protocols, particularly Uniswap and Compound.  


In 2022, over 167 million BAT was locked in DeFi protocols, despite the wider crypto and DeFi markets experiencing a contraction in asset prices during the recent winter.  
 

BAT is fungible and can be moved between protocols based on the holder's needs. Brave also revealed that many users prefer to engage with exchanges like Uniswap, and Compound but if you would like to have your own crypto portfolio management FlyntFinance will do the job.  
 

However, the specific amount of BAT locked up in these platforms is not immediately clear. Over 99% of the total 1.5 billion BAT tokens are currently in circulation, but a large portion remains in centralized exchanges like Binance and Crypto.com. At present, over 18% of the total supply, or 270.78 million BAT, is held by centralized exchanges, with Binance Global and its subsidiary in the United States holding over 37%.  


Additionally, holders prefer to keep their tokens at Bittrex, Gemini, and Bitflyer."
7/3/23,GameFi became a growth leader in the crypto space,"From the massive fall of BTC price to the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, 2022 was full of upheaval for the blockchain industry. But the blockchain community has always been resilient, finding new ways to develop in the most challenging times.   
 

A striking example of optimism and growth is the development of the GameFi industry, which combines gaming, DeFi, NFTs, and the metaverse.   
 

I think it's not a surprise that GameFi became a growth leader in the crypto space, with successful projects like Gala Games, Decentraland, The Sandbox, Axie Infinity and there are plenty of others worth mentioning such as Star Atlas, Coin Fantasy, Splinterlands, etc.   
 

The GameFi sector has continued to develop, attracting more and more investment. In 2022, the volume of venture investments in Web3 games and the metaverse amounted to $7.6 billion. Some analysts predict a valuation of $2.8 billion for the GameFi sector by 2028.   
 

However, a sudden influx of investors in this growing sector has also resulted in many low-quality games suffering from poor in-game economics, as well as monotonous and underdeveloped gameplay.   
 

What do you think we need in GameFi so it could become even greater?"
7/3/23,Celsius converts thousands of BTC,"Celsius converted 22,962.8 WBTC into bitcoin on Feb. 28.   


The transaction occurred with the consent of the Celsius creditor committee, according to a filing in the lender's Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection proceedings on March 3.   


No reason was given as to why the exchange occurred. Wrapped bitcoin, or WBTC, is an ERC-2o token interoperable with the Ethereum blockchain.   


One of a number of crypto lenders to fall afoul of the bear market, Celsius entered into Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in July, when it revealed a $1.2 billion hole in its balance sheet. Since then, it's been working through a restructuring process and figuring out how to pay creditors and things have gone well since. Crypto asset management platforms like Celsius, FlyntFinance, and Pantera have done relatively well in spite of the crisis.  


Last month, it put forward plans for a sale to NovaWulf  Digital Management, an investment firm founded in 2021 by former Wall Street dealmakers. Those plans were supported by the Celsius creditor committee earlier this week."

Unless these two groups played a significant role in the market's survival, it would have died long ago.

Developers create the technology and protocols that are the foundation of the crypto market. Investors provide the capital needed to support the development of new projects and technologies. Without their involvement, the crypto market would not be what it is today.

As a result, we should make sure developers have the tools they need to build their own projects, just as DIA Data's code base, sources, and methodologies are always available and open-source, so that others can create their own projects using them.

This will help to create a more collaborative environment and promote knowledge-sharing. It will also encourage developers to share their projects with the community, thus helping to advance the industry. Additionally, open-source development can lead to greater innovation as developers are able to make use of the collective knowledge of the community.

The presence of a proven VC with experience investing in DeFi projects can really make a difference when it comes to crypto investors achieving particular milestones in market size and investment performance. This is a very important factor to consider when selecting a project in which you can invest for the long term."

7/3/23,"Ethereum tests $1,700 on the strength of booming NFT activity. Was the NFT boom in February only a haze?","On the back of soaring NFT activity, Ethereum tests $1,700. On-chain metrics show the recent ETH price downswing could dip further in March 2023.   
 

Since Feb. 14, the number of ETH burned has declined by more than 50% to reach 2,700 ETH on March 5. When more ETH is burned, it increases scarcity, ultimately pushing the price.   
 

Consequently, the burn rate decline has likely considerably impacted the net supply of ETH in the past weeks. And unless the trend is reversed, it could push Ethereum into the bearish zone.   
 

NFT trade volume is an indicator of a fundamental decline in Ethereum network value, leading to a potential price slump.   
 

I found the info that on-chain data by blockchain analytics firm Santiment shows NFT trading activity on the Ethereum network has slowed since mid-February. I should check with Toshi Tools as well.

7/3/23,Why is Reddit-backed $BRICK exploding today while everything else is down?,"BRICK (marketcap $3,800,000, up 45% today) is backed by Reddit, a company with a valuation of $10 billion.  The ability to trade BRICK on mainnet from testnet was recently enabled, and has already climbed 1000% in the last 30 days.  With only a $3,900,000 marketcap, I believe this native Reddit community point token has huge potential.

**Deflationary and Capped Supply:** This is not your average shitcoin with infinite supply and zero fundamentals.

Bricks will be the currency of r/fortniteBR and other things are expected to be added other than just buying a membership and reddit coins, so a solid use case is established.

There will be a **MAXIMUM** 250 Million Bricks to ever be distributed with a bonding curve similar to bitcoin's mining distribution over time.

Every time a FortniteBR Sub user uses his Bricks to buy a Sub Membership these 500 Bricks get burned so the **deflationary** mechanism is a nice bonus.

Combine the **Capped** **Supply** with people constantly **BURNING** Bricks out of circulation to get the Sub Membership and you get a nice formula for success.

This means that over time people will earn less and less **Bricks** per month.

**Ties to Fortnite:** BRICK is backed by Reddit and is the community point system for r/FortniteBR.  Fortnite has maintained a consistent monthly active playerbase of around 80 million, with 2021 being a peak year at 83.3 million MAPs.  Fortnite has more than 390 million registered players to keep the game alive and running. According to the data provided by Active Player, in the last thirty days, the game averaged 252,600,145 peak players in a day. - [https://fictionhorizon.com/how-many-people-play-fortnite-user-growth-stats/](https://fictionhorizon.com/how-many-people-play-fortnite-user-growth-stats/)Around 85% of Fortnite players are aged 18 to 35 - [https://explodingtopics.com/blog/fortnite-stats](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/fortnite-stats)

Fortnite has grown year over year since it began in 2017.  But that‚Äôs besides the point.  It doesn‚Äôt matter what BRICK is attached to, although being attached to fortnite certainly helps as most crypto investors align with the ages that typically play fortnite.  What matters is this coin is safe from rugpulls as it‚Äôs tied to a multi-billion dollar company.  What makes it a good opportunity imo is the fact the marketcap is so low.  Taking everything into account I‚Äôve already mentioned I think it‚Äôs a good buy right now and will only go up.

r/FortniteBR prohibits the transferring or selling of $BRICK acquired within the r/fortniteBR community.  This essentially has created two versions of $BRICK:  The internal version, found within the r/fortniteBR community, and the external tradable version found on sushi.com and RCPswap.com (Reddit Community Points swap).  This has produced the effect of locking the internal community supply as it‚Äôs unable to be sold.

**Safe:** Reddit, a privately held company, has a valuation of over $10 Billion as of 2021.  (Source: [https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621445/reddit-valuation-revenue-funding-round](https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621445/reddit-valuation-revenue-funding-round)) Reddit has even proposed that it might be worth as high as $15 Billion in 2023.

A company of this valuation has employed a very large legal department (Google: ‚ÄúReddit legal department‚Äù and scroll through results to get an idea of the size) to handle all major decisions involving risk.  This extends to vetting any cryptocurrency projects it might affiliate itself with.  

Since $BRICK and $MOON are specifically affiliated with two of Reddit‚Äôs largest subreddits, these have most certainly had countless hours of research and vetting done by numerous legal department staff.  Imagine if Reddit *didn‚Äôt* fully vet $MOON and $BRICK, and something like a rugpull or exploit happened draining either of all funds.  They‚Äôd be sued on a massive scale, and would likely be found liable for damages.  

Thus, we can deduce that $BRICK and $MOON have been fully vetted, and are likely some of the safest Memecoins you could invest in today, since they are essentially backed by a multi-billion dollar corporation.

**Chart:** [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/brick](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/brick)

I believe $BRICK is extremely undervalued with a marketcap of just $3,900,000.  This is a drop in the bucket when compared to other memecoins of years past such as Dogecoin, Safemoon and Shiba Inu.  Dogecoin at its peak had a marketcap of $88.8 billion dollars.  Just for comparisons sake, if $BRICK ever gets to this marketcap, you‚Äôd see a return of 3670x your initial investment, meaning $500 invested today would turn into $1,835,000."

7/3/23,my opinion of my study on BTC and BCH,"I recently got involved in this, posing as a new and common user, to investigate the behavior of the BTC and BCH communities for my thesis.

My summary conclusion is that the BCH community is healthier and more collaborative than the BTC community.

Leaving aside the issue of prices, BCH has many points in its favor.

1 Unlike the BTC community, BCH is committed to its goal.

while BTC only talk about how rich they will be in BCH they promote the Use of BCH and encourage new people to Use it with great projects like **Flipstarter** and **Chaintip**.

&#x200B;

All bitcoin posts talk about riches and luxuries, the reality is that the average user is not able to make investments as risky as bitcoin. at this point BCH comes into the game and beats it by far.

&#x200B;

More and more businesses are using BCH and this is a reality.

a common user probably wants to have BCH for convenience when making payments, for living in countries where their currency is devalued, for speed.

that is, BCH is logical in the real world, bitcoin is logical for a rich person who can put 100K in BTC and wait 5 or 10 years and who does not need to touch it or if it fails it does not affect him.

&#x200B;

If I could define both communities in a few words, it would be:

BTC is digital gold and nothing else.

BCH is technology, trading, brotherhood and it is definitely designed for everyone and not for a few.

This is one of the first times that Tether printing has not resulted in a BTC price jump. For that reasonm, I'd say BTC price would've dropped a LOT more if Bitfinex hadn't run the Tether presses steadily for the past month. Watch out below..."

Access 24-hour deep liquidity with the option to settle instantly or later

We are proud to present the FIX & REST Post-Trade Settlement OTC API in the Crypto.com Exchange!¬†

This upgrade gives users much greater flexibility with OTC trades, with the ability to access 24-hour deep liquidity while locking in prices with block-size transactions. No collateral is required and users have the option to settle funds at a later time.

In addition, users can trade with size while avoiding significant market impact. With the Crypto.com Exchange acting as one of the most licensed counterparties in the industry, making OTC trades comes with peace of mind.

7/3/23,This is the most inept service I've ever worked with. Can't get help without constantly doing 2FA?!,"I've had ETH stuck in a vault account that I cannot remove. About half a year ago, I was told to do 2FA (driver's license front and back) - which IMO is an extreme violation of your privacy, who knows where those images are being stored, the level of security being used, what's being done with facial recognition, who they are being shared with (I realize this is becoming more common, it's why I ditched Kraken years ago, but I digress) -- regardless, I submitted the driver's license as instructed, and my ticket was shortly closed after several days of no response. Responding to the closed ticket resulted in no response. I deeply regretted sending the images because they're now on some cloud server for an eternity.

A lot of things happened in real life for me and I had this issue on the back burner. Fast forward to today, they are now refusing to assist me unless I do 2FA again plus a clear shot of my face. This is insanity. I could just sign up and buy Bitcoin on numerous other trading apps without having to go through ANY of this nonsense. But in this case, all I'm trying to do is regain access to something I already own. 

Coinbase is SO hard to get in touch with. The tickets take days and days to be answered. The live chat: in just 15 minutes I went through 3 reps, because they kept dropping out and being replaced with someone new who started all over again with ""how can I assist you today?"" and I had to start my whole story from square one each time. With the revenue this company makes, they can't do better than this clown show?

I suppose I can kiss 2 ETH away because I refuse to keep submitting 2FA/pictures, and now a high res picture of my face? I realize some might think this is ridiculous while others might understand why this bothers me, but for this to *now* be the only way to even get a 2nd sentence out of a support rep is the epitome of bad business."

7/3/23,Building a Strong and Engaged Crypto Community: Tips and Strategies,"Cryptocurrencies have become increasingly popular in recent years, and as a result, the crypto community has grown rapidly. Building a strong and engaged crypto community can be a powerful way to increase adoption of a particular cryptocurrency, gain valuable insights and feedback from users, and generate positive buzz and awareness around a project. In this blog, we will discuss some tips and strategies for building a successful crypto community.

1. **Establish a Clear Vision and Mission**

Before you can start building a community, you need to have a clear vision and mission for your project. This means defining what problem you are solving, who your target audience is, and what your long-term goals are. Once you have a clear vision and mission, you can use it to communicate with your community and attract like-minded individuals who share your values and goals.
