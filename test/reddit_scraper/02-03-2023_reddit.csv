Is shit only going up from here?

More seriously seems NFTs on Bitcoin (Ordinals) are kind of taking off. Since I have to fill the 500 characters I'll mention that the Bored Ape Yacht Club creators (Yuga Labs) are also hopping on the hype and going to release their own NFT collection minted on Ordinals, it will be 300 generative art NFTs.

1/3/23,"Ethereum has outperformed Bitcoin by 460% in number of transactions, but sending BTC has been 3.5x cheaper: A view on 2023 data so far","I've gathered Jan-Feb 2023 data from both blockchains to see how the two biggest hounds in the shed are performing in terms of number of transactions and their costs.

For BTC, I've used Nasdaq data. For ETH, I've used etherscan's native data. Data was taken from 1st Jan 2023 to 28th Feb 2023.

Note: This analysis **does not** include L2 contributions, as this is not available on etherscan (at least not that I could find).

# ETH surpassed BTC by 460% in number of transactions

That's pretty much the summary on transactions. The totals in transactions so far are:

**BTC: 17,146,792**

**ETH: 61,654,763**

This is expected as there are way more things happening in the ETH chain, such as tokens, digital collectibles etc. An overview of the data is below:

[Values in the y-axis is in millions of transactions](https://preview.redd.it/0jq059npa5la1.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a8f200abd930dd95d2b09a0c46583a2e6afd3d61)

# Sending BTC has been ~3.5x cheaper than sending ETH

The average fees per transaction are:

**BTC: $1.28**

**ETH: $4.47**

I've divided the amount of fees paid in a day by the number of transactions in that day for BTC. ETH's data already comes in averages. Charts are below:

# TL;DR

Since 1st Jan 2023, Bitcoin's blockchain settled 17,146,792 transactions at an average cost of $1.28 per transaction. Ethereum's blockchain (L1) settled 61,654,763 transactions at an average cost of $4.47 per transaction.

Values are expected since ETH's blockchains have plenty of stuff happening at the same time."

The idea goes - since Moons largest trading pool is with ETH. If the price of ETH crashes the price of Moons will indirectly crash as well. 

[Names censored to protect the identities of everyone involved](https://preview.redd.it/0r4ibw0gi0la1.png?width=625&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f8709152d257aae34435c5d179d30bb0117f5793)

We all need to be extra aware of this plot as Moons are under an incredibly unique threat from this plot. If these individuals are able to do what they want, Moons could easily drop 50% when ETH drops 50%.

These aren't the only people making plans I've also stumbled across similar plans on Twitter.  

https://preview.redd.it/nh4t49ick0la1.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=18a9b7ed1396726ae876956e0d0b77b2c48d032b

When Ethereum is being manipulated by a few traders who sold Moons low here is what you can do: 

1. Be aware of what's going on. Knowledge is Power. 
2. If ETH drops 50% don't panic sell your Moons at $.10. The value of Moons are only down because of these individuals plot. They'll recover.
3. Hedge your bets. If you truly believe in the future of Moons, you can try selling your ETH for more Moons. If Moons recover you'll be happy you did, and it'll take power away from these individuals. 
4. Be patient. Crypto is too big for a few plotters to manipulate one asset for a long time. Even if it's a low marketcap crypto like Ethereum. If you're patient you should be able to see both Moons and Ethereum recover as the manipulators run out of funds and lose the ability to manipulate the market."
1/3/23,"U.S. National Anthem now considered financial advice, per SEC press release"," \- Washington D.C.

The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) announced today that they are banning the performance of ""The Star Spangled Banner"" at all public events across the U.S., citing concerns that the song's lyrics could be used to manipulate the cryptocurrency markets.

The SEC pointed specifically to the use of the words ""rocket"" and ""flag"" in the song's lyrics, which they claim could be interpreted as bullish signals in the crypto world. ""You degens will not be disrespecting America with emojis"" said the commissions Chairman, Gary Gensler.

The rocket and flag emojis were recently cited as dangerous financial advice, as they could be used to signal to other investors to buy or sell so-called promising projects like Ethereum Max.

""The SEC takes market manipulation super serial,"" said a particularly environmentally forward-thinking spokesperson, seen eating the water bottle given to them prior to our interview as a means of recycling. ""We cannot allow the star spangled banner to be used as a tool to manipulate the markets. We urge all Americans to comply with this ban and to refrain from using these emojis in any context related to crypto or financial advice.""

The ban has been met with mixed reactions, with some crypto investors expressing outrage, and crayon eaters applauding the SEC for their efforts to maintain market integrity. Some musicians have also expressed concern over the ban, citing the Star-Spangled Banner's historical significance as a symbol of American pride. ""This old world is getting to me. There's just no trust, no tegridy."" one gig musician said.

The ban will go into effect immediately. The SEC has warned that any violations will be met with swift and severe penalties. This is a developing story."

1/3/23,How Many xMoons You Need to Earn to Eat Ramen for a Month,"First let’s take the cost of a ramen packet. Being conservative I’m going to use $0.45 as the cost of a ramen packet although I’ve seen them for much less.

I am also going to estimate a moon distribution layout of .9. However the last distribution was over 1 (round 36) due to a bridging event and before that .93 (round 35).

Ramen: $0.45 per packet 
Moon Ratio to Karma: .9
Moon Price: $0.198

Using these numbers the math is easy.
You need 2.55 Karma, which is 2-3 upvotes per day to afford your ramen packet!

2.55 Karma * 0.9 Moon Ratio * Moon Price 0.198 ≈ $0.45441. 

2.55 Karma * 30 Days = 76.5 Karma per month to eat ramen every day. Not a bad deal!

This would be an easy option for those who have a load of moons already. Since it wouldn’t affect your multiplier. Heck I earned 337x packets of ramen already this moon period!

Also assuming you want to protect your KM multiplier by retaining 75% of your moons and it cost 76.5 Karma per month to eat ramen everyday off moons you need to earn 4x that to make sure you don’t lose your earning multiplier. 

306 Karma for one month to eat ramen everyday and retain your multiplier. Enjoy your noodles!

Edit: This was just for fun remember there are Eth fees too!"

& it all went downhill from there. 

Got caught up in the hype. Listened to youtube shills religiously, traded my ETH for a bunch of shitcoins, kept buying the peak and panic sold most of my coins during the crash. Every possible mistake a newbie can make, I made.

I got burned so bad whatever was left in my portfolio was sitting at something like -85% if not worse. Dropped out of crypto for months but eventually picked it back up. Kept learning about crypto projects, trading, do's and dont's etc. and slowly started putting money back in ETH/BTC mainly, DCA'd for months.

I did not become rich. Actually just broke even, currently sitting slightly back into the green but with a stronger hand and very hopeful that the next big bull run will finally pay off.

Was just wondering about people experiences with crypto since they very first started trading. How's your investment doing?"

Source is FTX Japan's filings.

Seems Bitcoin holders are the smartest ones, pulling out the most (-47%). Ethereum second smartest (-40%) and XRP holders maybe still have some trust in a FTX Japan restart (-22%). Numbers don't match up exactly because for withdrawals I took the crypto amounts, rather than USD amounts.

Anyway if you also have coins in FTX Japan and have not been following, be aware you can withdraw now!"

1/3/23,Seems like ethereum killers will never succeed.,"This may be an unpopular opinion, but I believe ethereum killers will never succeed, why? Because they don’t get the adoption ETH does. 

And unlike BTC, ETH is forever evolving. There’s a team behind ethereum making the coin better. 

ETH2.0 shows that it will always get better and crush it’s problems. Not only that, a lot of people consider ETH the second coin to not be an ALT. 

I like to view BTC as a house, it’s great to live in, it slowly will go up in value. 

But eth is like the car, it’s got so much. You can live in, you can use it to move stuff, you can move it to make money, (Uber/taxi). 

And even if a coin is faster than eth, it doesn’t matter too much, the MC of ETH is 300 billion (aus)

BTC is still down about 65% from its All-time-high and right now we are also pretty much stuck at the crucial $25k resistance where we got rejected a couple of times just in the past days. But there are more important metrics than prices…

One of them is how many have BTC, this basically can be a good indication of vague understanding of how many new users entered/left Crypto. Of course not a 1:1 metric as one person can have multiple addresses.

If we now divide this metric even more we can look for whale addresses (which have been decreasing) or retail addresses. The best way to describe retail addresses would probably be addresses with a very low amount of Bitcoin, lets go absurdly low to even $10:

What a sight this is, while the BTC price has gone down crashing and burning last year the addresses with >$10 declined a bit then stayed steady and now just are near or already at an ATH with over 24M addresses.

This is truly one of the most bullish metrics out there right now, especially as during last bear markets we have had sharper declines of >$10 addresses but this time it mostly stayed steady and just shows how much adoption we saw that people are still so convicted even in a bear market."

1/3/23,A No-Shill Avalanche Deep Dive,"##**TL;DR - Avalanche Pros and Cons Summary**

This is super long, so here's the obligatory TL;DR. (Please don't ask for a TL;DR of the TL;DR)

####**Pros**:

* **Low transaction costs**. It's cheaper than Ethereum and even a little cheaper than most L2s, but it's more expensive than cheapest blockchains like Polygon, Solana, and Algorand. It can get considerably expensive when congested.
* **Very-fast Deterministic Finality**: 2s, which ties for the fastest
* **C-Chain is EVM-compatible**: So it's super easy for other EVM devs to move to Avalanche.
* **X-Chain is orders of magnitude faster and more efficient than Bitcoin**, but that's not much of an accomplishment since everything else is too
* **High fault tolerance**: Avalanche consensus has high fault tolerance. It requires ~80% malicious validators before it allows bad transactions.
* **Warp Messaging**: This is a recently-released cross-chain messaging protocol inspired by Polkadot's XCMP and Cosmos Hub's IBC. But unlike the others, it can send any type of message, with the downside that it's not entirely trustless.
* **1 Blockbuster App - DeFi Kingdoms**: DeFi Kingdoms (DFK) migrated from Harmony One to Avalanche in May 2022. 90% of the total activity on the Avalanche ecosystem (including subnets) is from DFK.

####**Cons**:

* **The X and P Chains are barely used**, add extra complexity to the ecosystem, and are mostly useless. They get 0.1 TPS of activity combined. Non-Avalanche wallets don't support them.
* **Moderate throughput**: 70 TPS (gas target is 15M gas per 10s moving-window) compared to 60 TPS for Ethereum L1. So it's barely faster than Ethereum and much slower than Polygon PoS. There is way too much misleading marketing saying Avalanche is 4500 TPS, which only applies to the barely-used P and X chains.
* **Subnets have incredibly-bad incentives**: Subnets are neither L2s nor sidechains. Subnets help the security of the primary network, but get nothing in return. **The economic incentive is completely backwards.** You have to pay 2000 AVAX to set up a validator to provide security to the primary network. The only benefit of building a subnet is that you get to rent Avalanche's existing validators, but no one is doing that. In fact, it's a security risk. There are backwards economic and security incentives to join as a subnet vs building your own separate network. Subnets would be better off building on Ethereum, Polkadot, and Cosmos.
* **Consensus protocol is complex and likely inefficient compared to BFT**: Avalanche Consensus was designed for DAGs, but they forced a variation of it on the linear C and P chains. It requires 20 rounds of back-and-forth messages between nodes compared to 1 round for classical BFT. It's needlessly complex for a linear blockchain.
* **Very low adoption and usage**: C-Chain currently gets 1/6 of the daily transaction count of L1 Ethereum, and but it would be worse if Ethereum wasn't already hitting its gas target.
* **Low Liveness**: The Liveness threshold for stopping the network is 20%. It only takes a single network entity to take down the entire network (though it would be economic self-sabotage). Ava Labs by itself owns 20% of the total stake while all the German validators own 40%.
* **Poor tokenomics**: The AVAX token is very inflationary (220% in 2021, 27% in 2022). The burn amount needs to be 500x greater to offset issuance.
* **Too many competitors**: Avalanche's C-Chain was often marketed as an L1 ""Ethereum killer"", and its subnet ecosystem is sometimes marketed as a Cosmos Hub and Polkadot parachain competitor. However, they're already way ahead of Avalanche in terms of adoption and marketcap, and Avalanche doesn't do noticeably better than any of them.

Avalanche is a Jack of some trades, Master of none. It's not enough to stand out in an already-crowded market.

**End TL;DR**

-------------------------------

##**Avalanche Deep Dive**

**Avalanche is blockchain ecosystem** that consists of 3 built-in chains (C-Chain, X-Chain, P-Chain) and a few independent subnets. When people talk about the Avalanche blockchain, they most often mean just its EVM-compatible C-Chain.

Currently, Avalanche is mainly used for DeFi Kingdoms, which accounts for over 90% of all daily transactions on the entire Avalanche ecosystem. Avalanche would possibly be dead now had DFK not moved to it from Harmony One back in Apr 2022.

##**The 3 Primary Network Chains**

**[Avalanche's primary network is divided into 3 built-in chains](https://support.avax.network/en/articles/6077308-what-are-the-differences-between-the-x-p-and-c-chains) and does not include the subnets.**

If you're using Metamask, any EVM-compatible wallet, or any exchange, you're using the C-Chain. In fact, most people don't realize the P and X chains even exist.

* **C-Chain - Contract chain**:
  * This is the main chain everyone thinks about when they talk about Avalanche.
  * It's responsible for 95% of Avalanche primary network's daily transactions
  * Linear Chain with account transactions like Ethereum
  * Uses Snowman consensus
  * Used for EVM-compatible smart contracts and DeFi apps.
  * Compatible with most EVM wallets
* **P-Chain - Platform chain**:
  * Linear chain with UTXO transactions
  * Uses Snowman consensus
  * Used for staking, validators, and managing subnets.
  * Only accessible with Avalanche wallets.
* **X-Chain - Transaction chain**:
  * DAG structure with UTXO transactions
  * Uses Avalanche consensus
  * Used for sending and receiving assets.
  * Only accessible with Avalanche wallets.
  * Fast and uses AVM.
  * Orders of magnitude faster and more efficient than other UTXO DLTs like Bitcoin and Cardano

**AVAX**: All 3 built-in chains use AVAX as their native currency token.

**Poor Wallet support**: The C-Chain is compatible with all EVM wallets, but the X and P chains aren't. You have to the use an Avalanche wallet to move tokens between the 3 chains because other wallets won't recognize the X and P chains. But native Avalanche wallets are pretty bad in that you can't generate additional accounts with them. You have to switch to an EVM-compatible wallet to generate additional addresses from the seed.

**X-Chain and P-Chain transactions use paired UTXOs**, a variation of Bitcoin's model. Transaction are roughly the same size as Bitcoin transactions (paired UTXO), but the blocks are incredibly tiny in comparison. Uses 5-10 kb blocks (vs ~2 MB for Bitcoin), which get packaged quickly and finalized in 2 seconds.

##**Consensus Protocols**

####**Avalanche Consensus (X-Chain)**

* **Complex Protocol**: [Avalanche consensus](https://docs.avax.network/overview/getting-started/avalanche-consensus) is very complex and requires upper-division-college understanding. If you really want to understand it, watch the 40-minute video in the link (possibly multiple times).
* **ELI-12 explanation**: Each node picks a random set of validators (based on staking power) and asks them whether to include a transaction (technically vertices) into the DAG. If a quorum (14/20) validators agree to that transaction, a consecutive counter is increased. Each transaction needs 20 consecutive above-quorum rounds in order to be added.
* **Works well when there are no conflicts and very few transactions**: As long as there are no conflicting transactions, consensus will take ~20 or more rounds for each transaction. If there is a conflicting transaction, the consecutive counter starts all over. If there are a lot of conflicts, Avalanche becomes extremely inefficient and could lose liveness. Fortunately, the X-Chain is dead and currently gets 1 transaction every 2 minutes, so it doesn't have to worry about conflicts.
* **Needs higher percent of honest validators**: Avalanche Consensus normally needs a high percent of honest validators who don't submit conflicting transactions: ~80%.

####**Snowman Consensus (C-Chain and P-Chain)**

* **The C and P Chains use Snowman Consensus**, a variation of Avalanche consensus built for their linear, non-DAG blockchains.
* **Uses blocks instead of a DAG**: The main difference is that conflict sets are based on blocks instead of individual transactions. They also use mempools to organize blocks. This makes them a lot more efficient than Avalanche consensus, especially since they now use [Snowman++](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/tree/master/vms/proposervm#snowman-congestion-control-for-snowman-vms) to help avoid conflicting block proposals.
* **Likely inefficient compared to BFT**: Avalanche Consensus is a complex protocol that was designed for DAGs, not blockchains, so it's not likely to be efficient for the C-Chain. It takes a minimum of 20 rounds of back-and-forth messages between nodes to reach consensus. And if there is a conflict on the 19th round, it starts all over. Classical BFT uses larger committees but it only has 1 round, so it should be much, much faster. Classical BFT is also much more straight-forward in design.

####**Validators**

* **Validator Count**: Avalanche has [1200 active validators](https://avascan.info/staking/validators?s=totalWeight%2Cdesc#tabletop) (Feb 2023)
* **Reward requirements**: There is no slashing, there is an 80% uptime requirement to get rewards
* **Unknown Identities**: It's hard to tell their identities because they have no names (aside from the 'Genesis Entities', which belong to Ava Labs).
* **High security, but low liveness**: It's pretty hard to calculate the Nakamoto Coefficient because we don't know the identities of the validators. They spin up a new validator every 3M AVAX (staking limit). The total stake is 216K, and it needs 20% to compromise liveness (percent of malicious actors needed to stop a network) and 80% to compromise fault tolerance (percent of malicious actors needed to produce bad transactions).
* **A single entity could take down the entire network**: Despite having 1200 validators, the largest validator organization (Ava Labs) could single-handedly compromise liveness of the network. Back in 2021, Ava Labs held 46% of validator staking power, making it completely centralized. This is now down to 20%, which is still a very large proportion. Of course, they wouldn't sabotage their own network. Of the remaining 50 largest validators, about half of them are located in just 3 German cities. This is very unusual considering that Germany only accounts for 6% of Ethereum validators. So the German validators combined could easily take down the Avalanche network too. But there isn't any obvious economic incentive to do so given how much they're staking.

####**Fast 2s finality for built-in blockchains**

All 3 Avalanche networks have a [fast 2 sec irreversible finality](https://docs.avax.network/build/tutorials/platform/integrate-exchange-with-avalanche/). 

So in terms of block times, it's as fast as Polygon PoS, but without the reorgs. And it's 6x as fast as Ethereum.

####**Maximum throughput analysis**

**Throughput: 71 TPS**

**Misleading throughput marketing**: Any marketing where you see Avalanche being advertised as a 500+ TPS network (I see 4500 being the most-quoted number) is extremely misleading. Those high figures are only for the X and P networks, which really don't matter at all since they're both under 0.01% of their usage limit. They will never hit that limit since C-Chain is the bottleneck.

The best way to describe Avalanche's throughput is that it's **only 20% faster than Ethereum L1 on average**, and it can burst up to 60% faster than Ethereum for brief moments before gas price starts skyrocketing due to its own version of EIP-1559.

**Calculations**: I'll be basing throughput measurements on basic 21K-gas transfers. This is so that I can make an equivalent comparison with other networks.

  * **C-Chain - 71 TPS**: This is the important one because 95% of Avalanche transactions are on the C-chain and most users only ever touch the C-Chain. The C-Chain's 2-sec blocks have an 8M gas limit. With 21K gas transactions, that means a theoretical max throughput of 190 TPS (compared to 119 TPS for Ethereum). However, that's unsustainable due to EIP-1559 gas prices, which keeps its throughput artificially low. C-Chain's modified version of EIP-1559 where its gas target [15M gas every 10s](https://docs.avax.network/quickstart/adjusting-gas-price-during-high-network-activity). **This means its actual max throughput for basic transfers is 71 TPS (compared to 60 TPS for Ethereum).** This is noticeably slower than Polygon, which can do ~350 TPS at its own EIP-1559 gas target.
  * **X-Chain - 7000 TPS**: Uses Avalanche VM. In ideal test situations (150 nodes, 10kb blocks), the X-Chain can get [up to 7000 TPS](https://assets.website-files.com/5d80307810123f5ffbb34d6e/6009805681b416f34dcae012_Avalanche%20Consensus%20Whitepaper.pdf). Even when you increase the number of validators to 2000 (it currently has [1200](https://avascan.info/stats/staking), about the same number as Algorand), it still gets around 6900 TPS due to the DAG network structure. This chain is only seeing under [2000 transactions a day](https://avascan.info/), so it's only using 0.0001% of its capacity.
  * **P-Chain - 4500 TPS**: Its purpose is for governance, staking, validators, and subnet management, so it'll probably never get near 0.01% of its 4500 TPS limit.
  * **Combined throughput**: The [stats dashboard](https://stats.avax.network/dashboard/overview/) often shows TPS in the low hundreds, but this is also misleading because it's actually the combined throughput of all Avalanche networks and its subnets. And it's mainly from the subnets. When I report Ethereum throughput, I don't add throughput from the Polygon and BSC networks.

####**Very little actual activity**

* **C-Chain**: [150K daily transactions](https://avascan.info/blockchain/c/home) (1.5 TPS of actual activity)
* **X-Chain**: [1K daily transactions](https://avascan.info/blockchain/x/home) (0.01 TPS of actual activity)
* **P-Chain**: [10K daily transactions](https://avascan.info/blockchain/p/home) (0.1 TPS of actual activity)

**Only the C-Chain gets any noticeable activity.** People make fun of Cardano for only having 60M transactions since its genesis, which is the equivalent of just 2 months of Ethereum transactions. Well the P and X chains combined have only had 6M transactions, the equivalent of 1 week of Ethereum transactions.

**Avalanche would've done better if it had dropped the P and X chains** and focused only on the C-Chain. The P & X add so much additional complexity. Only Avalanche wallets recognize those networks. I have to use separate blockchain explorers to view transactions on them. It's unnecessary complexity that no one is benefitting from.

The same could be said for subnets, which I'll get to later.

##**Subnets**

Subnets suck. Up until Warp Messages were introduced in Dec 2022, there were basically no substantial benefits for building Subnets.

####**What is a subnet (without the marketing BS)?**

Originally, Avalanche ""Subnets"" referred to independent groups of validators, but that was confusing as hell. To make things even worse, [Avalanche documentation](https://docs.avax.network/subnets) often switches between definitions and uses it to refer to the independent blockchains matched with those validator sets. Thus, it would mean either.

Subnets are sovereign blockchains, mainly used for application-specific purposes. They are not Layer 2 despite all misleading marketing documentation suggesting that they are. They're not even sidechains. Polygon PoS at least uses Ethereum for its MATIC contract, has a dozen contracts on Ethereum required for the security of its own blockchain, has staking on Ethereum, and has 30-45 minute checkpoints on Ethereum. It needs Ethereum for its security model. Subnets are not like that.

Subnets can rent Avalanche primary network's validator sets. But in reality, this doesn't happen. Instead, all subnets do is allow their own validators to validate Avalanche's primary network, which benefits the primary network but not the subnets. 

The only real benefit Avalanche provides for subnets is its recently-released Warp Messaging, which is somewhat similar to Cosmos's IBC and Polkadot's XCMP. There are a few differences, which I'll cover below.

**There are currently only 3 live subnets** (DeFi Kingdoms, Swimmer, and Dexalot. Loco Legends has no activity.) They each have 8-10 validators and do not share any validators.

**To be honest, I don't think subnets have any practical purpose in their current form.**

####**Incredibly bad incentives for building subnets**

1. **Backwards financial incentive**: It costs 2000 AVAX to set up each subnet's validator set, which is about $400K USD for the 10-validator subnet commonly-used. $400K isn't expensive for a validator set, but the economic incentive is backwards. If I'm setting up validators, why am I paying you? Shouldn't you be paying me to use my validators if I'm providing you additional security?
1. **Backwards security incentive**: Subnets provide additional security for Avalanche, but they get nothing in return. They're not rollups or sidechains. All they get in return are shared development and blockchain explorer tools, which are really weak incentives. They have to use off-chain bridges to connect back to Avalanche's C-Chain.
1. **Low interoperability**: Subnets are completely independent from each other and don't share execution protocols, storage, or networking. There's no requirement for them to be interoperable or use the same gas tokens. For all practical purposes, they're completely independent.
1. **Subnets aren't sharing validators. Using other people's validators is a security risk.**: Validators from other subnets can validate each other's blockchains but none of the 3 subnets are doing this. You can look at their subnet pages and compare the validators there with their own blockchain explorer validators. You'll find that there are no extra validators from other subnets. This makes sense since there is no financial or security incentive to use other organization's validators. Plus, it's a security risk. What is their incentive to be honest? There is nothing at stake for them to be honest for us. I can create an off-chain incentive, but this is really roundabout when I can just acquire my own validators without needing Avalanche.
1. **Warp Messaging**: Warp Messaging, just released in Dec 2022 in GoAvalanche 1.9.5, is the only significant benefit of subnets. It's a cross-messaging protocol inspired by Polkadot's XCM and Cosmos's IBC protocols. You can use it to send any type of message between subnets using the P-Chain. This allows for more-secure cross-chain bridges and more-efficient oracle blockchains (like what Cosmos and Polkadot already have). You can send any non-standard bytedata over Warp Messaging, not just valid messages, so there is still trust involved. The biggest weakness is that you still have to trust that 1) the messages being sent are correct (requires immutable, bugless contracts) and that 2) the validators on the other subnet are signing correct messages and not losing any of them.

####**The 3 Subnet blockchains**:

* **DeFi Kingdoms** (DFK) launched an [Avalanche subnet](https://subnets.avax.network/defi-kingdoms/dfk-chain/explorer) in March 2022 and had $150M in assets in the PoA/PoS subnet. It's currently seeing about 18 TPS of activity and has 5K active addresses. It uses a bridge to move AVAX to the DFK chain. DFK is the most important dApp on Avalanche. In fact, the DFK subnet accounts for 90% of the activity on the entire Avalanche ecosystem.
* **Crabada** is a decentralized game in which [every action](https://snowtrace.io/address/0x82a85407bd612f52577909f4a58bfc6873f14da8) was published to the Avalanche network. It was currently eating up 30% of Avalanche transactions at its peak, and each action cost ~$1. It eventually oved to its own subnet, [Swimmer](https://subnets.avax.network/swimmer), where it now has 0.2 TPS of activity and 370 active addresses.
* **Dexalot** is a [very basic DEX](https://subnets.avax.network/dexalot/details) which only has 6 trading pairs.

##**Tokenomics**

####**Transaction costs are cheap, but subsidized**

* **X-Chain and P-Chain ($0.02)** transaction fees are fixed at a low [0.001 AVAX](https://docs.avax.network/learn/platform-overview/transaction-fees/), which are currently $0.02 USD (Feb 2023). During the peak of the bull run, it was 20x more expensive.
* **C-Chain ($0.02)** currently has a 25 nAVAX minimum gas price. So basic transfers are in the $0.01-$0.03 range, making them a little cheaper than most Ethereum L2s. In the past while Crabada was still active on mainnet, basic transactions (e.g. transfers/swaps) were between $0.30 to $1.5. When Crabada moved to its own subnet, alleviating congestion, transaction prices quickly fell to around $0.05 on the C-Chain.
* **Costs are subsidized**: Note that transaction fees are kept low because validators are paid by staking rewards, which creates high inflation (over 10%) on the circulating supply.
* **Tx Fee Burns**: The [entire transaction fee](https://docs.avax.network/quickstart/transaction-fees) is burned, but the [current burn](https://snowtrace.io/chart/dailyburnt) is not enough to offset inflation due to lack of activity.

####**Poor tokenomics and high circulating supply inflation**

* The Avalanche networks are sustained by high inflation
* **Supply inflation**: **[Circulating supply](https://messari.io/asset/avalanche/chart/sply-circ) of the AVAX token has increased by 220% in 2021, followed by a 27% increase in 2022 ($3.5B).**
* The circulating supply is currently only about 45% of its maximum supply cap. The AVAX can dilute its supply by another 120%. Validators are paid by staking rewards, and those staking rewards account for a HUGE amount of annual inflation.
* **Burn rate is 500x lower than issuance rate**: Transaction fees are burned, but the transactions fees are so low that the [burnt amount is unnoticeable](https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/avalanche). Burns are in the millions of dollars while issuance is 500x greater in the billions of dollars. Compare this to Ethereum, which [has a small amount of deflation](https://ultrasound.money/).
* **Estimated Supply Growth**: AVAX issues 45M tokens per year starting at 2025, which means that it will reach its 720M max supply in Apr 2030. Unless fees magically grow 100x higher by 2030, AVAX's supply distribution model is going to break.

1/3/23,Five reasons to be bullish on the long-term outlook of Moons.,"This sub is getting extremely bullish on Moons: from new usecases, Moon Liquidity Rewards, General sentiment, to increasing awareness about Moons. Here are some of the reasons to be Bullish on the long term outlook of Moons:

1. **New Usercases:** With the introduction of the sellable banner, crypto entities are able to burn Moons in order to get an advertisement at the top of our sub. With the most recent Banner purchase, [the cost was about $700 per day (3,500 Moons)](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/banner_records).
2. **Moon Liquidity Rewards:** There are a [ton of reasons to be bullish](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/11ckjae/four_reasons_to_be_bullish_about_moons_and/) about CCIP-051 paying out rewards to Moon Liquidity providers on SushiSwap. It creates a way to earn Moons on top of your Moons, earned Moons through liquidity aren't subject to KM rules, it helps to stabilize Moons supply/ market price, and it attracts outside money into the Moon ecosystem. APY for CCIP-051 currently sits at 56% - but will drop  hard once it goes live.
3. **Top Moon Holders are Bullish:** If you want to know how a crypto might perform long term you should consider what top holders think. Largely the most active users are contributing to the development by providing liquidity and increasing the overall awareness of Moons. 
4. **The Community:** A successful crypto project needs to have a Community behind it. The CryptoCurrency Sub is the 79th largest sub on Reddit at over 6.1M members, and as more and more people learn about it - the sub will continue to grow at an astounding rate. 
5. **Increasing awareness about Moons:** Moons are becoming more and more popular especially for the reasons listed above both on and off of Reddit. Moons are one of the best known assets in this sub, and awareness is being spread in other places like Twitter. Even the CEO of CoinGecko is a Moon Holder. Yet for all that awareness - Moons have a marketcap of only 21M, and are ranked 3,715.

Often alot of minds can be changed by giving away free stuff ( *ofcourse everybody loves free stuff* ), but the reach of Reddit is limited as a social media.

You might have heard about the rumors that 'Rockstar Gaming' and 'Take-Two Interactive' could integrate an in-game cryptocurrency into their new upcoming game: **GTA VI** (GTA 6).

Rumors are ranging from NFT's to adding Web3 components with also some people talking about implementing a Play-to-earn model into the Online missions. Also interestingly, the gaming studios executives have previously shared [(link)](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-and-ea-executives-are-big-believers-in-nfts/1100-6497712/?UniqueID=78CAA59E-47FC-11EC-A2B7-47DEBDCD475E&ftag=ftag%3DGSS-05-10aab8e&PostType=image&ServiceType=twitter&TheTime=2021-11-17T23%3A17%3A02) an affinity for NFTs and Web3, which ofcourse has fueled even more speculations.

While everything seem like rumors yet, the whole idea doesn't seem so far fatched, GTA 6 offers a perfect opportunity to the developers to seize on the Metaverse hype. GTA 5 already offers players an opportunity to engage in huge array of activities, socialize and role play,

something that Zuckerberg ( *fuck the Zuck* ) has been hoping to accomplish in his amaturistic 'Metaverse' but with much better gameplay and graphics since 2013. ( almost 10 years since its release already! )

**Let's see a comparison in graphics and quality:**

**GTA V:**

The game’s predecessor, GTA V, is historically one of the most successful games in the industry, despite being a decade old, selling over **175 million** units worldwide. However, players are looking for something new, and with GTA 6 likely to be coming out in 2024/2025, there is plenty to be announced yet.

Having played GTA V for years, I cannot wait to be able to play GTA VI, but having NFTs and Web3 intigrated into the game creating a much better Metaverse would possibly make it the biggest introduction of Crypto towards the masses.

Personally I am looking forward to this future, and if they can make this work, it will likely become the end of Zuckerberg's Metaverse."
1/3/23,What happens to your crypto assets when you die? Need a plan?,"We all know that cryptocurrency is a digital asset that is stored in a wallet. But have you ever considered what would happen to your wallet if you were to pass away suddenly? Have you made any plans to ensure that your loved ones can access your crypto assets when you are gone?

It's important to think about this and take necessary steps to ensure your digital assets are passed down to your family members or beneficiaries. 

Here are a few things to consider:

### 1. Have you told anyone how to access your wallets?

Many people keep their crypto wallets private and secure, which is a good thing. However, it's also important to make sure someone you trust knows how to access your wallet if something were to happen to you. Have you talked to your spouse, kids, or a trusted family member about how to access your wallets?

### 2. Have you made a plan?

It's crucial to have a plan in place to ensure your digital assets are passed down to your loved ones. This plan can include creating a list of your wallets and passwords, setting up a trust, or even hiring a lawyer to draft a legal document. Have you made any plans for your crypto assets?

### 3. What about the different scenarios?

The plan can vary depending on your personal situation. If you are a single person, your plan might be different than that of a married person or someone with kids. If you're married, you might want to involve your spouse in your plan. If you have kids, you may want to make sure they are aware of your crypto assets and how to access them.

But it's always interesting for those who haven't yet figured out the why of Bitcoin to hear someone representing the SEC state this truth: Bitcoin != Crypto.

The implications of what Gary Gensler just said are significant because it means that future SEC attacks on the cryptocurrency industry will not target Bitcoin. Bitcoin cannot be attacked by the SEC. Gary Gensler knows this, and he says so.

Obviously, since the price of Bitcoin on the spot market is driven by human psychology and emotions, you may still see the price of Bitcoin impacted downward with every announcement of an attack on the cryptocurrency industry by the SEC or another US authority.

But in the long run, it does confirm that Bitcoin is here to stay and that Bitcoin is where you should turn if you are really looking to protect the fruits of your labor.

In addition to this statement by Gary Gensler, you should also be aware of another important fact. Many institutions are waiting for more clarity on what the SEC plans to do in relation to Bitcoin. If the SEC confirms what Gary Gensler is saying, then it means that the CFTC would probably be the one to take over the potential regulation of Bitcoin.

Once this is clearly established, you can expect a massive influx of capital from institutions into Bitcoin.

As an individual, this is not something that should worry you too much in my opinion. Indeed, Bitcoin is there to give you back the power over the fruits of your labor in a censorship-resistant way by protecting you from inflation.

Owning Bitcoin is a right, and you don't basically need government permission to do so.

The sooner you understand this, the better off you will be, because you will be able to save in Bitcoin, and then little by little, do everything to live in Bitcoin. There is still a long way to go, but the goal is clear: the hyperbitcoinization of the world.

Time is on Bitcoin's side. And no one will be able to stop the Bitcoin revolution from going its way as long as the people continue to support it."
1/3/23,"Those who have been into cyrpto for 3+ years, how did your portfolio look like back in the day? Which coins made it to your current one?","Today I was looking through some old notes of mine and realized how much things have changed.


When I started my portfolio looked something like this: BTC, LTC, XMR, NEO, DASH, ZCASH, NANO.

I then later added ETH, LINK, COMP, XLM. 

I had no idea what I was doing and really the only reason I chose to even go with those was because they had a relatively low max supply. Except for ETH and XLM. 


Today, I've parted ways with most of them, including LTC. NANO and NEO were the first ones to go. 


Curious to see how things have changed for you guys. What did you keep, what did you sell? 


And for those who are new, do you think you'll have the same coins 3 years down the line from now?"

[Snapshot](https://web.archive.org/web/20130509235146/http://coinmarketcap.com/)

2022 was a difficult year in the crypto sector, and a great number of businesses collapsed from the downturn. Despite the collapses and the hundreds of billions that evaporated from the market, it is a significantly larger forest compared to the small patch of trees it once was in 2013.

Yes, a substantial decrease in the price of the asset due to falling demand and uncertainty about the assets value. But why are they so important to the market and what is their goal at the end? Well, that may be nothing else than testing the long-term conviction of the remaining holders, testing how many people actually have a proper belief in what they invest.

In other words, it is to test the endurance of the core investors of a project, the only ones that believe in the vision of the project and are not only here for the “quick money“. Those holders have to show endurance even during the maximum pain possible and this bear market definitely was that:

Through those graphs we can see how this bear market of 2022 was the second-worst bear market on many metrics with especially long-term holders taking very high realized and unrealized losses.

At the end, we can still cherish us all up as we are indeed survivors of this bear market and have shown that even this test has been successfully endured and survived by us, long-term holders.

It definitely is nothing for granted to survive this kind of a bear market, many did not, that is why we should look back for one moment and appreciate ourselves."

According to data from Glassnode posted by analysts on February 28, more BTC has not moved for a decade or longer than is available on cryptocurrency exchanges.

On-chain analyst, Will Clemente, published some remarkable data, which he described as ""wild statistics"". According to Glassnode, the current balance on exchanges is about 2.25 million BTC.

Another well-known analyst, Willy Woo, said that there are 2.6 million BTC that have not moved in the last ten years. Additionally, in a 2020 study, Chainalysis estimated that about 3.7 million coins had been ""lost"".

Therefore, this number of inactive coins may increase to over 3.7 million BTC (which is over 19% of the current circulating supply) by 2030.

# Hodlers unfazed as BTC remains inactive 

This statistic is very positive for Bitcoin holders. This was stated by industry expert ""Byzantine General"" in response to the tweet:

  ""It's quite bullish for hodlers. However, if BTC is ever going to be used as a real currency, I think we'd like to see more movement instead of holding.""

Clemente also noted that during every bear market, short-term tourists and speculators leave. However, an increasing number of Bitcoin network users remain steadfast.

Crypto and DeFi analyst, Miles Deutscher, looked at Bitcoin's price performance this year so far. He observed two consecutive green months. However, he warned that historically, March has been the second worst month for BTC.

https://twitter.com/milesdeutscher/status/1630377326415605760?s=20 

 

Capriole Fund founder Charles Edwards remains positive, predicting the start of another bull market. On February 28th, he cited several reasons for this forecast, including arguments from many long-term technical and on-chain indicators, market activity, and optimal timing of the halving cycle. He also said that the macroeconomic climate is changing:

  ""We are approaching a macroeconomic regime change. In 2023, the Fed is likely to stop raising interest rates and change policy. Over the past half-century, rates have tended to fall every time inflation falls as quickly as it is now.""

# BTC price prospects 

Bitcoin was trading at $23,402 at the time of writing this text, which is without significant changes compared to the same time yesterday. Moreover, BTC seems to be cooling off after its rally at the beginning of 2023 and has fallen by 5.6% in the last week.

The support is located at the level of $23,000 USD. The next level is $22,000 USD, which has not been seen in the last two weeks. Above that, there is a strong resistance at the $25,000 USD level. It has already been tested and rejected four times in February."
1/3/23,The Temptation of FOMO,"During the bullrun you will see a lot of new projects coming out. And let me tell you, no matter how bad that project is, it will seem like it is the next 100x coin. You will want to buy like there is no tomorrow. But please dont jump in without thinking and planning your trades.

I used to FOMO when I first started into crypto. I was also in the previous bullrun and I FOMOed again, I am telling it to you now so you dont do the same mistake. I entered into various projects that seemed like it will skyrocket, and I thought I will “make it”. Do you know what happened to those projects? Well half of them rugged and the other half went down %90+. 

Now you will probably say stuff like I have seen posts like this before but I am posting this because many people still do it even though it gets posted so many times. It doesnt even have to be a bullrun. I still see people who jump into projects that went up %50, %100 in like a day or two… Why? There is a huge chance that you will lose on that investment.

In conclusion, PLEASE dont FOMO. I know its tempting but there is a high chance you will regret it. Just wait a little bit before going in, DYOR and DCA.

1/3/23,"Maybe it's just me, but sometimes I thank God that Bitcoin was invented!","Humans at an individual level are usually flawed but as a group, we tend to govern ourselves well. Democracy has worked so well because of this. However, due to consolidation of power at the top, it tends to become corrupted as ""Nothing corrupts better than power""

Humans tend to cheat. If left to our free will, we will tend to incentivize immediate gratification instead of delaying it. Maybe that's just how our brain works. Maybe evolution teaches us to live for the short term as it tends to increase survival. 

But this same instinct of ""Now rather than later"" makes up for terrible monetary policies. 

The Federal Reserve is a good example of this phenomenon. 

I don't even wanna bring up the topic of how the Fed was formed and the Bretton Woods, yada yada... Most of you know this already. Long story short, they're shady at best and hold the power to dictate monetary policies of the world reserve currency. Which has huge ripple effects all over the globe.

The fact that global debt is in $31Trillions gives you an idea of how far they have kicked the can down the road. Just for the future generations to pick up our debts. Countries owe each other debt, but ultimately it has to be paid in some form and at some point in the future. It will ultimately be burdened to future generations. 

Basically, the top echelons of the old system who hold all power have gratified their needs one way or another and have pushed the bills to future generations.

Now, coming to the Bitcoin part. It's a rules based monetary policy that can't be corrupted or diluted away like the fiat system. It fixes the incentive problem of people at power being able to cheat the rules. 

The ledger being public, protocol being open sourced means anyone can validate, contribute and audit the system. 

Maybe this realization is why I remain ever so grateful that Bitcoin was invented. It's also this understanding that made me understand that the fiat valuation is by all sense purposes a transitory form of valuation. That ultimately Bitcoin will reach a plateau where goods and services will eventually be priced against BTC instead of ever needing to come back to fiat. It's only a matter of time!"

The banking industry provides a safe and secure place for people with excess money to deposit it and earn a small incentive while lending the money out to those who need it but lack the capital. Banks have become masters at mitigating risk and making everything as uniform as possible. 

**However, the current issue with banking is that it has become so consolidated that it can no longer perform its role as a financial intermediary effectively.**

The mid-1990s marked a significant change in the banking industry when computers and credit scores became widely adopted, leading to a shift from building relationships with bank managers to relying on credit scores. Today, when applying for a home loan, borrowers typically do so online, at a branch, or through a mortgage broker, and the details are sent to an assessment office where workers verify that the information is correct.

But the most serious warning he has issued in the last two decades has been that large consolidated banks are increasingly unwilling to lend to the business. Inherently, business lending is more difficult than consumer or residential lending. If a mortgage default occurs, the bank will still have a house to sell in order to recoup some or all of their losses. If a company fails, a bank will most likely never see that money again. Businesses are also becoming much more complex. To mitigate risk, a bank would need to assess the health of a business, which is extremely difficult. Certainly, it goes far beyond the scope of the standardized mortgage application process.

As you may see, there's a pattern here. Automatization and digitalization can solve this kind of problems.

Instead of fearing the risks of this technology, banks should be looking ahead to its potential benefits.

**Cryptocurrencies can help banks become more competitive in today's increasingly digital business environment. The first step is raise own awareness, because they can help attract new customers and prevent existing customers from migrating away.**

I would love to ear the community thoughts on this!

Thanks!"

I think many can also be arrogant, prideful, unaware, ignorant, prone to bankruptcy, etc. Here are things I've learned along the way. Yes, I am a crypto investor.

1. Many people will quit their job too early and/or not make as much as they should because the idea of working for someone that is not as smart as them irks them. Hint: your boss doesn't care about you. Smile and nod. Make friends. Get favors. Use your job (if you wish) as your ability to buy more crypto. Point in case: my pride cost me about $1,500 a month extra that I wish I could be adding to Eth.
2. Get a hard wallet. Put it in a safe.
3. If you're ability to pay your bills is impacted by crypto, lower your lifestyle or reset. I knew a 28 year in 2008 who lost 12 homes. He wasn't able to save 1.
4. To address #4, look at how many have blown up in the last 2 years. Now look at the people still here. What's the common demnonator? Trading, trading with leverage, and wanting to make the KILLER trade. That's ego...did 3 arrows really need more $. No. They wanted to be know as Kings. Kings often get killed.
5. Leads me to this: Be unknown. Let me give an example. Your new bf/gf finds out you can buy a house cash. Why should they work? Most relationships fail when nothing to do.
6. If crypto is a small percentage of your net worth, then understand your bet. I know a lot of people who went from 50% crypto, timed the market very well, and now have 5%. If crypto succeeds then end up being the sterotypical rich dude at 60.
7. To go on to #4, once you start trading, it's very hard. Look at Tesla 1 year vs 5 years. Imagine the person who has 2,000 in savings per month who has put all of into Tesla, without fail, for the last 6 years. Hint: Many of those 24,000 years are worth over 100k.
8. Stay away from people who do drugs, drink a lot, and want to party, especially on your card. You will meet people who will take advantage of you in code or literally rob your ass. These are not real friends. Hint: if they are very likable when you meet them, run."

1/3/23,‘Our Interests Are Aligned' With the SEC: Coinbase CEO - Decrypt,
1/3/23,Just some things to keep in mind,"1. Listening to the majority of people. If everyone is saying the price is going lower, it’s likely not going to go lower. Ex- everyone calling for new lower lows 
The same can be said for the opposite. If everyone says the price is going higher, chances are it won’t. Ex- everyone calling for 100k in 2021

2. Buying high and selling low. If you bought high then consider adding to your positions to lower your average cost instead of just selling and taking a loss unless you’re trying to harvest loses. This helps a lot in bringing you back to initial investment faster than if you just held your bags and didn’t add to them. This can be beneficial for projects you believe in. It can also benefit for projects you don’t believe in by lowering your average cost so can look for better opportunities to scale out on the pumps as almost everything will pump at some point 

3. Educate yourself on which exchanges to use as how you want to store your crypto. If you use a wallet make sure you always send a small test transaction before blindingly sending your whole bag. The blockchain isn’t very forgiving to human errors. 
Also only keep your seedphrases OFFLINE 

4. Everyones a brainiac and investment guru when prices pump in bull markets, stay humble and don’t try to outsmart the market. The real money is made during times of uncertainty 

5. The 4 year cycle is real thing and should be taken seriously until proven to be invalid. 

6. Bull market profits are usually made before the bull market officially kicks off. When the hyped is at all time euphoria then it’s time to scale out, this should align with the 4 year cycle timing and stages"

So from a practical perspective, it looks like sending money with crypto is the best choice.

However, crypto is a world difficult to access by many people. So I was wondering, have you used crypto to send money abroad to relatives or friends? Did they have any problems creating a wallet and cashing out?"

1/3/23,The stablecoin Djed has only 882 hodlers.,"DJED is the first native stablecoin on the Cardano (ADA) network, which launched at the end of January 2023. However, it may not be doing very well. According to Cardano TapTools, the total number of users holding DJED is only 882. 

https://twitter.com/TapTools/status/1629659434426200064?s=20 

This information prompted the community to discuss the matter. Many people also started analyzing the TapTools report, trying to figure out the reason for the low adoption rate and whether the reported hodler numbers are accurate. 

 

# Delayed adoption or doomed to fail for DJED? 

The Cardano community is quite active on Twitter. Therefore, without exception, they decided to add their two cents on the volume of DJED holders.

In response to TapTools' claims, Twitter user Lone Wolf stated that ""DJED failed to catch on"" due to the high minimum minting of 5000 DJED / 5000 SHEN.

https://twitter.com/Defiant82\_\_/status/1629738925559275524?s=20 

Claynation community member, Belk Tre, suggested that it would be easier to buy DJED on Coinbase. According to him, the low volume of hodlers may be related to the low availability of the stablecoin. 

https://twitter.com/belk\_tre/status/1629844893316136962?s=20 

On the other hand, AI art collector Dom Stocchetti believes that the small number of hodlers is surprising. However, he argues that ""upcoming stablecoin regulation is probably scaring people off.""

In addition to community members' responses, the official developers behind the stablecoin also commented on the TapTools tweet.

# COTI responds 

COTI Network is the official creator and issuer of the DJED stablecoin. In response to TapTools' claims, COTI stated that DJED adoption ""is just beginning."" According to the company, the reason for the low number of hodlers is the fact that the stablecoin was launched less than a month ago.

COTI has suggested that DJED ""has more holders than stablecoins with market capitalizations of hundreds of millions of dollars."" The team added that they are ""very pleased"" with the current data.

In addition, COTI noted that it is ""unclear"" whether the numbers reported by TapTools include holders of DJED and the supporting SHEN token, holding tokens on DEXs. The company stated that the ""actual number may be even higher.""

The ADA price has fallen 10.3% over the past seven days and is currently at $0.36. However, it is unclear whether this drop is related to the above tweets or not."

1/3/23,"What are interesting, regular-Joe stories of the crypto lore that you know of?","We have many regular people (like you and me, not like e.g. Hal Finney) that helped to build the lore of the crypto world over the years, who also made it into the news somehow.

To me the best example is **James Howells**, whose saga to retrieve a hard drive containing 7,500 BTC from a dump yard was first reported [9 years ago](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/27/hard-drive-bitcoin-landfill-site). It is interesting to see how ironically the original piece at The Guardian referred to digital wallets, putting this latter word in quote marks:

https://preview.redd.it/2kp9r3wft4la1.png?width=1222&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=adeaf404db4439ed4539993a34eb99d169e41a5a

On his words:

>""You know when you put something in the bin, and in your head, say to  yourself 'that's a bad idea'? I really did have that,"" Howells, who  works in IT, told the Guardian. ""I don't have an exact date, the only  time period I can give – and I've been racking my own brains – is  between 20 June and 10 August. Probably mid-July""

To this day I think about this guy.

There's of course also **Laszlo Hanyecz**, the 10,000 BTC pizza guy. The story starts funny, as reporter by [The New York Post](https://nypost.com/2021/05/24/bitcoin-pizza-guy-who-squandered-365m-has-no-regrets/):

>In May 2010, California student Jeremy Sturdivant, then 19, noticed a  bizarre request on a cryptocurrency internet forum: He could receive  10,000 bitcoins, at the time reportedly valued at $41, in exchange for the delivery of two large pizzas to Florida resident Laszlo Hanyecz, 28.

I'd be more interested in hearing about non-famous cases, or cases that happened e.g. at your country and did not make into English-written news media.

Mine is: an acquaintance took his final payment and rights and put everything in DOGE around 2015. Ended up with $2M or so. I didn't talk to him much, but now he's doing fine."

1/3/23,What were your first handful of transactions in the crypto space?,"After commenting on a post about biggest loser, it got me thinking of back in 2021 when I first finally made the jump and bought crypto, I didn't have a disaster story like some, but did make a few small mistakes along the way, it went like this;

&#x200B;

* Buy £25 worth of ETH (big amount i know)
* Move to trust wallet via binance chain (noob)
* Decide don't want to be stuck on binance chain
* Buy BNB
* Transfer BNB to trust wallet
* Use BNB to move ETH back to Binance
* Profit?

So as the question in the title says, what was everyone else's first load of transactions in the crypto space?

1/3/23,How Would It (Whale's Manipulation of BTC Price) Work Exactly?,"So, after two years of reading comment after comment about 'whales manipulating the market' and 'looks like whales are pumping/dumping again,' I started to actually think about how exactly would that go down.  I mean, I understand a little about how large purchases can be placed above the current price or below to manipulate the market into upping the buys or lowering their sells (though honestly I'm not even sure I can wrap my brain around how that works either, but I digress), but what really what I want to understand is, how big would their buys have to be to influence something like Bitcoin?  It's got a pretty hefty market cap.  Even on low volume days, I would have to imagine a lot of capital would have to be invested to pump or dump BTC in any significant amount.  

Could you pump or dump with just one purchase?  Would you have to place several large buys or sells at varying prices?  Do you think they would have to program a bot to do it?  What exactly would that entail?  Would they have to work in tandem with a team of whales?  Are there whale clubs or secret whale societies?  

Seems to me so many of you wholeheartedly believe every action in the market is influenced by whales, I have to assume at least a few folks out there have thought about what it would take to influence the market."

By the time you hear about it, the ship has sailed.
Let's face it, most 100x picks are just dumb luck, It doesn't matter how cool or advanced the project is (remember Doge and Shib?).
If a project has already blown up on a subreddit like this one, it's pretty much guaranteed that you missed your chance at that sweet 100x gain, but don't despair, you can still make some decent profits with the popular coins, just don't go expecting to see those four-digit % gains.
The risk of getting scammed or rug pulled in this wild-west market is huge, so keep your cool and don't let FOMO make your decisions for you. Stick to making well-informed and thought-out investments if you want to see some reliable long-term profit."

I saw this post on here a day or so ago and it was the first time I ever thought well that means it is inevitable that btc can literally only double so many times before it becomes impossible and that may be the killer that we could all see coming but couldn’t except.

So, 

1. For people way smarter than me, is this true? Will we reach a halving cycle where there simply isn’t enough money to keep it going/worth it?

2. How many more halving a could bitcoin realistically keep doubling?

This makes me think, this next bull run halving of 2024 may possibly be the last face melting bull run to new ATHs that has enough money to be worth it. 

That being said I’d say get it what you can now and TAKE PROFITS hard in 2024ish time because eventually there may not be enough money to keep the party going.

If I am dead wrong and bit c doesn’t have to keep reaching new ATHs forever to exist please let me know. Thanks!"
1/3/23,"In 2022 as crypto started dropping, most people were buying the dip instead of selling. What was going through your head?"," 2022 is gone but the memories of it still hurt.

As many people here I made the same mistake of not selling when we started the selloff in 2021. I was oblivious to the fact that FED has started tightening.. even if I did know that I wouldn't have sold cuz ""crypto doesn't care about macroeconomics duh"".

Instead as the selloff progressed I DCA'd my way down.

The situation in this sub was pretty similar from my recollection. The entire sub was yelling buy the dip buy the dip... hell even #Buythedip was trending on twitter... that buy the dip mode in the end just became an exit liquidity for smarter players

In the end I sold most of my holdings at 48k on that bounce in april but I know some of my friends didn't.

So as hard as it may be for some of you to remember this... could you dig through your mind and describe the mental state, the thought process that was happening at that time.

* Why didn't you sell?
* Why did you buy the dip?
* Did you use any stops?
* Were you waiting for 100k?

My personal answer to all of this is: *I was waiting 80k and simply refused to be content with anything less.. and in my mind I HAD TO BE RIGHT .. market cannot be dumping now.. everyone is expecting 100k*

My God looking back this sounds so ridiculous... but I don't want to forget it.. I want to clearly remember that state so I never repeat it

1/3/23,Why I think Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) is the Best Strategy for Investing for most investors.,"**Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)**

For the people not knowing what Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) is, it consists in investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals regardless the price of the asset/coin. For example: If you have $100 to invest per week, you invest that amount every week without taking care the price of BTC.

This are the reasons why I think it is the best strategy for most of people:

1. **Reduces the impact of volatility:** It helps to smooth out the impact of price swings by investing the same amount over a long time, meaning that you have less risk to get caught in sudden price movements.
2. **Removes the emotional element:** As we all know investing in crypto is a roller coaster of feelings. When prices go up, FOMO and hype appears and when it goes down panic. Investing a fixed amount at regular intervals removes this emotions.
3. **Disciplined approach:** It helps to stay focused in long term goals and avoid getting distracted by short term price movements. It also helps to build good investing habits that can be used to other things in life.
4. **Automation:** As you buy the same amount every an exact time you can automate it and reduce the effort you need to put to buy crypto.

Regarding to DCA out, it applies the same rules. You reduce the risk to get caught in sudden prices movements.

**TLDR;** ***DCA in/out and enjoy life***

1/3/23,"Who created Bitcoin ""Dorian Nakamoto or Hal Finney?""","**Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto** (Yes, that's his real and full name), *Trained as a physicist at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, Nakamoto worked as a systems engineer on classified defense projects and computer engineer for technology and financial information services companies. Nakamoto was laid off twice in the early 1990s and turned libertarian according to his daughter, and encouraged her to start her own business ""not under the government's thumb.""*

He once said in an interview by journalist Leah Goodman *""I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it. It's been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection.""* It's almost as if he admitted to to being the Bitcoin founder, but that isn't necessarily true.

*The article's publication led to a flurry of media interest, including reporters camping out near Dorian Nakamoto's house and subtly chasing him by car when he drove to do an interview.* Now this could have freaked him out, but who wouldn't be freaked out by that. 

*Later that day, the pseudonymous Nakamoto's P2P Foundation account posted its first message in five years, stating: ""I am not Dorian Nakamoto."" During the subsequent full-length interview, Dorian Nakamoto denied all connection to Bitcoin, saying he had never heard of the currency before, and that he had misinterpreted Goodman's question as being about his previous work for military contractors, much of which was classified.*

**Hal Finney** was the first person to purchase Bitcoin from Satoshi Nakamoto, as well as the first to use the software, file bug reports, and make improvements. What's even more crazier is that Hal aslo lived in the same town as Dorian Nakamoto for 10 years. *In March 2013, Finney posted on a Bitcoin forum, BitcoinTalk, a publication called ""Bitcoin and Me (Hal Finney)"" where he states he was essentially paralyzed. He recalls finding out that Bitcoin had gained monetary value in late 2010, and mentions that despite ALS disease was causing his ability to code to be slower, he still loved programming and that it gave him goals. He continued to program until his death; he was working on experimental software called bcflick, which uses Trusted Computing to strengthen Bitcoin wallets.* RIP Hal Finney, You're a true hero. 

Now, My thoughts in question **""Who created Bitcoin?""**

I truly believe that it was Dorian Nakamoto, a trained physicist, a libertarian, a systems engineer is the real Bitcoin creator who wanted to set everyone free from the shackles of the inflated financial system, especially once The Great Recession started in 2007. I also believe that Hal Finney helped him in creating the Whitepaper. It only makes sense since they lived in the same town for 10 years. Dorian might have been afraid of what might happen to him if Bitcoin became more progressive in the future and or that amount of fame turned him off, which I can't blame him. Not even sure if anyone knows his whereabouts now? Or if he's still alive? 

One man Just wanted to change things for the better of the people, and he did that. Thank you Satoshi Nakamoto."

1/3/23,What’s your biggest F up in Crypto?,"In 2021, I took a leap of faith and invested $6,000 to purchase mining rigs. After a month of mining, I became fascinated by the world of crypto trading. Eager to make a profit, I dove deep into online forums and discovered ShibaInu. One particular post on this subreddit caught my eye, where someone claimed that somebody purchased this coin for $50 million. Without thinking twice, I invested in ShibaInu and to my surprise, made a quick profit almost overnight.

My confidence in crypto trading grew, and I began to diversify my portfolio. I invested in Mana, another promising coin, and saw my profits grow once again. However, it was LRC that caught my attention and convinced me that I had struck gold. I invested heavily in LRC and watched in excitement as its value skyrocketed. At its peak, LRC was trading at over $3, and I almost tripled my initial investment in the mining rigs. I was convinced that I was on the cusp of becoming a millionaire😂 and I eagerly shared my newfound wealth with family and friends, encouraging them to invest as well.

But, as the old saying goes, all good things must come to an end. In the volatile world of crypto trading, this proved to be true. Almost as quickly as LRC had risen, its value came crashing down, taking my portfolio with it. In hindsight, I realize that I made a costly mistake by not taking any profits and investing in low-quality coins that resulted in further losses.

As a result, I now own only a small fraction of what I initially invested and have lost the trust and credibility of my family and friends. 
Looking back, I now realize that if I had converted the crypto I was mining into stable coins, I could have made good profits lol"
1/3/23,A token for improvig democracy?,"I just thought about this and I really like to start a discussion. 
Lately we are seeing a huge weakening of the democratical system all around the world. At the moment, in a democratic country, you vote a candidate and you basically delegate him on every decision he will have to take. Basically, when you vote, you sign a contact of long-term trust with your candidate. 
This is the main weakness of the system. Democracy should improve is the possibility for everyone to actually take part to every decisions the government is taking. Basically democracy should become trustless. 
Does this ring a bell? How can this be achieved? 
I see the blockchain as the absolutely perfect technology for this to happen. A token that allows people to take decisions and the more tokens they have the more weight your vote will have. Like it's already happening with Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrecies. This may sound risky and worrying, and of course it would be carefully introduced. 
There could even be more than one token, one for every topic and people can earn them in various way, like following relevant courses-quiz or other ways. The token should have no pecuniary value and it can't be traded, but it can have expiration dates so you always have to be updated. 
This won't be mandatory, there will still be elections and you still have to vote your candidate. But now if you want you could earn tokens to influence/help the decision making process of your country. If you don't want this, you don't earn tokens and the voting system and decision making will work exactly as it is currently working. 
I just thought about this, I'm not an expert in politics and it may be a stupid idea but it seems to work in my mind. What do you think? Could this work? Do you have suggestions
to improve it? I see the biggest obstacle of this coming from politicians, are they willing to share their power?

tldr: to improve democracy, I propose a token that everyone can earn to partecipate in the decision making process of your country. The token works like a PoS cryptocurrency but with no pecuniar value."

On the eve of the Russian invasion, a Ukrainian App Developer was reportedly murdered over a personal dispute. 

Accounts are often settled during the chaos of war. And although the murderer's identity remains unknown, his motive was never in doubt. The victim was a core developer for the Raccoon Stealer Project, the world's most successful online criminal group. 

His colleagues fled the country. But they weren't running from Russians.

**CIVILIAN EXODUS**

The invasion displaced eight million Ukrainian civilians, all desperate to reach neighboring nations anyway they could.

Evacuation trains operated non-stop. Railway stations were maelstroms of confusion & personal loss. 4 out of 5 families left male relatives behind.

Zelenskyy declared Ukrainian men:

* Aged 18 to 60, subject to immediate conscription
* Barred from leaving
* Urged to volunteer with the Territorial Defense Forces

The immediate impact was suffered by fractured families forced to part with dads, brothers, & sons.

Conscription orders didn't apply to everyone. In Ukraine, corrupt practices are the rules by which the state runs. And exceptions are always for sale. 

The RS Project's Lead Developer used his wealth to:

* Dodge military conscription orders
* Drive across the Polish border, undetected

The Project's silence sparked wild rumors. Chatter intensified a month later when they officially announced it was over.

As of March 25, one project member was reported dead and their core developer, Mark Sokolovsky, went missing.

The FBI knew where Mark was.

* Videos
* Business contacts
* Purchase records
* Documents

His iCloud account produced enough evidence to charge him with

* Computer fraud
* Wire fraud
* Money laundering
* Aggravated Identity theft

This is only where the story begins. 

While the RS Team was disbanded, several threat actors moved in to fill demand. This produced a hacker civil war. The monetary consequences were larger than the size of the market they fought for.

The Putin-backed Conti Group nearly gained total market control. The people behind Conti were also investors in Hydra, the dark web's largest market. 

Conti's enemies led German Authorities to them.

1/3/23,Authenticating Human Generated Artwork Using Blockchain,"One of the hot topics regarding AI art is to differentiate between human generated and AI generated artwork.  There are some legal ramifications regarding copyrights to these works so it becomes important to authenticate authorship.  This is quite difficult as people can just lie about whether they generated the work or if the work was AI generated.

Blockchain on the surface doesn't seem like a solution if it was just simply uploading the file onto the blockchain for authentication purpose since the person uploading it can still lie.  However, it seems more interesting if the blockchain interface with the software used by the artist and as such intermediate copies of the progression of the artwork are uploaded onto the blockchain.  The AI artist would need to go through the trouble of going through all these processes to mimic what is happening with the real artwork.  Not impossible but somewhat cumbersome.

Is this a possible application for blockchain?  Is anyone on this project because this is one of those goldmine issues with regards to AI/automation right now."

1/3/23,You Would Be a Fool to Trust Robinhood’s New IOS Wallet,"I can’t stress this enough. Robinhood is not a trustworthy and reputable company and you would be a fool to trust them to hold your crypto in their new “IOS Wallet”.

It’s tempting to users because it’s directly integrated with the Robinhood app and has Defi and NFT capabilities.

Robinhood has time and time again been  extremely scummy. Here’s an example. They have been fined over $70 million dollars for misleading and manipulative actions toward customers. They have also been fined for manipulating assets by freezing accounts and trading on certain stocks and crypto. 

A company that will freeze your account, holdings, and trading of certain investments based on their views and ulterior motives is NOT to be trusted. Have we learned nothing as a community?

Enough big players have scammed the masses with rug pulls and exchange collapses led along by outright lies that Robinhood, a company with an already bad reputation, should not even be considered a good option for your crypto trading let alone a wallet with all your holdings."

One of the most common questions we get as a crypto tax law firm is:

""Can I claim my scammed crypto on my taxes?""

From a tax perspective, not much, BUT every case is different.

The tax code used to be a lot more clear on scams. Historically, you could take a deduction for theft losses or casualty losses as an itemized deduction. Unfortunately, this went away in 2018 with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Under the current tax law, you need to lose your crypto in a federally declared disaster. Which is almost never the case.

BUT there are some opportunities that potentially exist. One option is claiming the scammed crypto as a worthless security and taking a capital loss. The biggest concern is that we don't treat crypto as securities and the code states securities. Another option is a ponzi loss deduction from an exchange that shut down. BUT the code doesn't specify anything about crypto.

Everyone has a different situation and it may be best to speak to a professional about the options you have.

1/3/23,CryptoCurrencyLand: A Place Where MOONs Form The Basis of The Economy. Part 2 of The Redditverse,"A week ago I created this post [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/119av72/the\_redditverse\_a\_place\_where\_crypto\_community](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/119av72/the_redditverse_a_place_where_crypto_community) explaining how Reddit could create a Redditverse (Metaverse) with Community tokens as the base of the economy.

During these days I have been thinking about it and I have said, why wait for Reddit to develop it? Why not start developing it ourselves and show Reddit the potential of the r/CryptoCurrency community?

That's why I present to you:

# CryptoCurrencyLand: A Place Where MOONs Form The Basis of The r/CryptoCurrency Economy.

[One step closer to the future](https://preview.redd.it/tttg8wm0i6la1.png?width=437&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=004aff983f9b1fc0d77c58121dbf95de0ede6338)

The idea is the same as the Redditverse but instead of thinking big, we should start small by creating a Metaverse for this particular sub in a modular way that somehow can be replicated easily for other Reddit subs.

This is an small schema of the whole idea:

&#x200B;

[Concept](https://preview.redd.it/cfwv7yqzh6la1.png?width=581&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=735bd244f77e04d03559250bf9faa05f67fe1533)

# Community driven

I think the project should be community driven like MOONs and the initial steps should be to create a specific sub to talk about this project so people can give ideas and make proposals so with the help of everybody we drive the project, create a road map and a whitepaper, etc.

# Team

This is where this amazing community full of people with a lot of diversified knowledge plays the biggest role. All the people will be allowed to participate and help to develop, create graphics, etc. There is needed a lot of knowledge to achieve this project.

# Summarize

The main goal is to create an economy based on MOONs inside a Metaverse based on this sub to create new use of cases for MOONs and also show Reddit the potential of this idea and expand it to other subs.

# Last statement

I want to make it clear that this idea is **OURS**, not mine, and whoever wants to, can take it and start developing it. I just wanted to put this idea on the table so hopefully triggering someones brain to start doing it and create something awesome together in community.

**I believe that among all of us in this community we can create great things.**

1/3/23,The benefits of a diversified crypto portfolio,"Hi all,

A diversified portfolio is one of those stock investing principles I've found equally useful in crypto. In 2021 I had around 15 coins in my portfolio, which I've reduced down to around 10 these days, partly because I liquidated some speculative investments during the bear market. I'm always on the hunt for new candidates.

These are some of the advantages I've found from holding a diversified crypto portfolio:

&#x200B;

**1) Your exposure is limited if one of your coins dies**

This is the most important reason to diversify. No project is beyond failure. The obvious example here is LUNA, but if political or regulatory pressures impact another favourite coin then your eggs aren't all in one basket. Harmony (ONE) was another popular altcoin in this sub that got wrecked by the North Korean hack. Unless you're really committed to being a BTC or ETH MAXI, don't let yourself get drawn into one coin dominating your portfolio. This limits the pain from these inevitable black swan events.

&#x200B;

**2) You can invest or DCA into alternatives while one coin is at the top of a pump**

While we all know it's best to FOMO at the top of a pump /s, with a diverse portfolio you can switch to an alternative coin that isn't the current focus of market whims and potentially avoid buying at what may be temporarily inflated prices. This gives you a chance to observe whether the pump was temporary without feeling the need to keep feeding money into that coin at a local high.

&#x200B;

**3) Tracking several different coins gives you a better feel for the market**

Related to (2) above, different coins have their own cycles, particularly if they are in different segments (e.g. AI, Metaverse, low cap). Coins that see a strong pump relative to others will often experience stronger decline when the market is negative or otherwise gradually realign with the rest of the market later. Tracking multiple coins on a daily basis gives you a better feel for overall market sentiment and the current retail and institutional investment trends. This can help you avoid missing that latest trend, which may be a good chance to make money regardless of it's longevity.

&#x200B;

**4) It guards you from becoming a blinkered fanboy**

We've all seen them - people who will defend their one true coin until death. There no guarantees that any one coin will survive (see point 1), and the market isn't necessarily going to result in one coin to rule them all. There is plenty of scope for healthy competition and coins focused on different segments. Having a diverse portfolio stops you becoming entrenched and makes you open to different options. Why not hold your favourite coin *and* it's closest competitor(s)?

&#x200B;

**5) You can diversify risk levels within your portfolio**

Holding multiple coins allows you to vary the risk within your portfolio. You could have BTC or ETH as a 'lower' risk staple, then some top 20 altcoins for your 'mid' risk and a smaller share in some 'high' risk speculative small caps. Assigning a percentage of your portfolio to each coin or group of coins can really help prevent you from getting carried away and assigning too much of your portfolio to a high risk group. SafeMoon is a great example of a high risk speculative coin that people YOLOd their entire portfolios into - you can still find these poor ghouls haunting the lifeless halls of their sub.

&#x200B;

**For balance, here are a couple of the key disadvantages I've found:**

&#x200B;

**1) Managing and researching the additional coins takes time**

Mitigate this by not holding more coins than you have the time to maintain.

&#x200B;

**2) You can get regret and FOMO if one part of your portfolio outperforms another**

With the exception of coins that die, in my experience this is typically short-lived and coins will often take their turns in the limelight. The key here is to hold firm with your chosen investment strategy (DCA or whatever). Worst case, you might have less invested in a top performer than you would have liked, but at least with diversification you had an investment.

&#x200B;

**3) It might be more risky than just holding BTC or ETH**

Your thoughts here depend on how immune to failure you think BTC or ETH are. If you think neither could ever fail, then diversification will appear to be a riskier strategy. Alts are certainly more likely to fail, but do you perceive the certainty of BTC and ETH to be so high that you feel safe holding in an entire portfolio in one? This is an individual question and will be down to personal preference. 

&#x200B;

As always, hope this helps someone!"

 I'm looking to add one more coin to my investment portfolio and I have narrowed my options down to Polkadot, Atom, and Algorand. I know this is very subjective and I know there are many other projects that deserve attention, but here's a short overview:

Polkadot:

* Pros: Interoperability and scalability
* Cons: High supply of DOT tokens, has been very hyped in the past, now I don't hear that much about it anymore. Strong competition, e.g. Ethereum and Atom 

Atom:

* Pros: As part of the Cosmos ecosystem, Atom has a lot of potential and its staking mechanism also allows for participation in network decision-making.  The Cosmos Software Development Kit is a nice addition.
* Cons: Strong competition, e.g. Ethereum and Polkadot

Algorand:

* Pros: fast and secure transactions + proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. 
* Cons:  Tokenomics  aren't great, still quite centralized, strong competition

So, those are the options. What are your thoughts and which one do you think has the most potential for growth? I'm open to all opinions and perspectives! Don't hesitate to suggest other coins or highlight other potential downsides. One can't be careful enough!"

1/3/23,Controversy - Crypto is now a political asset,"The US financial systems seem to be looking for all sorts of new ways to push crypto out of the US. However, I don't see how cancelling crypto entirely would be good for the industry and for the US economy. It seems that introducing and finally regulating crypto properly should actually be beneficial for the US, considering jobs it would create, investments would flow in from overseas and talent would be attracted to an economy that seems to be slipping towards a slow and painful death. 

It seems as though there are other motivations behind the crackdown on crypto, and it looks like its coming from the East. When China became unfriendly towards crypto, the US seemed to welcome them with open arms, miners moved to the US because it looked friendly and made economical sense. However, now that China is starting to take a look at crypto seriously with the opening of Hong Kong, the US regulators started getting very active on social media platforms on their efforts to halt crypto."
1/3/23,CBDCs are an existential threat. We need to solve this.,"In the early days of BTC there were not a lot of fiat on/off ramps and I think pretty much none of the ones that existed were regulated.

They weren't specifically illegal, since there was simply no practical precedent in legislation and so by default it was largely gray-market.

i remember early on I even had a couple brick and mortar ramps - one was a local mobile repairshop, another was a pawnshop. The repairshop was pretty funny; in reality one of the co-owners was simply an enthusiast and it was basically his hustle, he charged around 10% and paid on 3 confirmations. If I ever went into the store and he wasn't there, none of the others had a bloody clue about crypto, though presumably the business did receive a cut.

IIRC correctly, by 2017 neither shop provided this cash for crypto service any longer, since there was already starting to be competition in the form of locally registered and operated online exchanges (I'm not from the USA).

Since the beginning of crypto - or at least my own beginning, around 2011 - I've never been a crypto ""holder"", ""investor"" or ""bro"".

That culture collectively killed crypto with it's greed and by being naive.

The thing that makes me angry about scams isn't the scammer, in some of the cases I respect the hustle even. It's the idiot that fell for it that then cried about it and pushed heavy regulations one step closer.

The amount of people I see on this sub effectively arguing for crypto to literally just be fiat is mind-boggling.

To be honest I've figured the dream to be dead a long time ago.

Here's the thing - CBDCs are coming. Many countries have agreed to legislate for them already, many with targets to have them in place this year. Along with digital ID, widespread rapidly adapting AI adoption, social credit (C¢P) and extremely repressive regulation - make no mistake - CBDCs are an immediate, existential threat to cryptocurrency.

CBDCs will be introduced with a traditional phase, co-existing with cash. I expect this phase will last some time, perhaps some years. During this time crypto will be constantly under pressure from increasingly harsh legislation. But it will continue to interfere with fiat.

One the transitional phase ends - fiat is no longer - I can guarantee that there will be no legal, regulated CBDC:CRYPTO on/off ramp. That would be absurd and make no sense.

It's up to us to make one, back to our roots (they're underground). I'm surprised Paxful still exists. It won't forever. We need to solve this.

* 16% have never moved their crypto off a centralized exchange
* 20% only practice self custody for safety but are not interested in using crypto for anything else other than trading
* 14% want to learn how to participate in the crypto ecosystem but don't feel confident enough yet to try it
* 50% consider themselves proficient in crypto and participate in DeFi or aspects of the crypto ecosystem.

36% of people on this sub don't currently participate or wish to participate in the crypto ecosystem.

If you fall into this category, **why are you not using crypto for it's intended purpose?**

The way I see it is if people start using crypto, this will help with overall adoption which will increase the value of the crypto you are holding. So it seams like a win win scenario to me."

1/3/23,SCAM WARNING: Finblox Platform is a scam - DO NOT USE AND TO NOT BUY THEIR FBX TOKEN (research),"TL/DR: FINBLOX STOLE MILLIONS FROM USERS AND CONTINUE OPERATING LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED. SCAM AND FRAUD PLEASE AVOID THE PLATFORM AND DO NOT BUY THEIR TOKEN

Finblox is a crypto lending platform like Celcius or Blockfi that also offer other services like crypto swap or launchpad ([https://finblox.com/](https://finblox.com/)). Last year were lending irresponsibly and lost millions dollars of users funds but unlike other platforms they did not go bankrupt and simply said 'LOL SORRY', quickly modified their Terms of Service and froze the funds. 

50% of all USDC was frozen and never returned to users while Finblox kept business as usual. Some users lost thousands or even millions while others lost life savings.

Now they are running an ICO and they swapped the frozen USDC into their shitty FBX token without the permission from the users. There is a lockup period for the token so the token will be useless because it will be dumped anyway.

They are obviously insolvent and trying to stay alive by selling their shitty token to US residents even though it is a security and they are not authorised to sell the token in the US.

On top of that they are currently being investigated by Securities & Futures Commission of Hong Kong for Suspected Unauthorised CIS and in order to escape the legal problems they recently moved to British Virgin Islands as FBX Technology Ltd. registered BVI Company with company number BC# 2090058 but they preform financial services despite not having a license to perform financial services. They are trying to switch countries to continue running their scam but soon will ran out of countries.

Additionally they are also banning/blocking anyone from social media (for example: [https://twitter.com/Crypto0Coins/status/1624858748681392129](https://twitter.com/Crypto0Coins/status/1624858748681392129)) a who mentions the frozen funds and are buying positive reviews on all review websites (for example: [https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/finblox.com](https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/finblox.com)) while removing the negative ones. 

They will downvote this post with bots as well, just see!"

I think this is normal because there is still little education about what blockchain can do and I see that most of them actually say that ""Crypto is just buying and selling very expensive monkey pictures, isn't that ridiculous?"". 

From this incident I saw a unique case that happened in my place with the nft hype. I saw people do selling any photos (food photos, photos of faces) in the hope that they would become richer. There are others who are victims of loss pull and become exit liquidity nft because they are only carried away by the nft hype and I'm sure they don't know the basics of supply and demand. 

From the example above, it explains that people only care about ""I want to get rich quick by selling my breakfast photos"" and fall victim to the hype. Most people think nft is just a stupid thing to sell pixels. The connection with this is that people find it easy to get rich. Yes, convenience is one of the keys to cryptocurrency adoption as a technology in the general public. I'm 99.9% sure that people have no idea how and why their wifi router transmits signals. They just know that ""I want to connect to the internet, I just need to turn on the router and press the wifi button on my screen"".

In this case, people need convenience (connected to the internet) so they can accept existing technology to help their lives. The unique use case that can be run in blockchain technology, is how a problem can be solved easily and quickly and doesn't harm other people. Thanks for reading."

1/3/23,Something to note about Crypto 435 and things in the political field,"So for those of you who don't know Coinbase started Crypto 435. [https://actnow.io/z31xN5P](https://actnow.io/z31xN5P)

According to their site

Crypto435 plans to help give crypto advocates a voice to influence laws and policies by bringing the crypto community together to show there is strength in numbers. Crypto435 also aim to promote innovation, protect jobs and educate everyday Americans about the power of crypto. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now the problem is, there is no details and the devil is always in the details when dealing with USA law makers. For example, a while back Biden told the gov to look into crypto and so on. Many of us took this as a good thing or maybe nothing will happen. But note there was 0 details given. And note most recently when that actually did happen, they slander and attack crypto nearly the entire time. 

Coinbase is a company. A companies number 1 job is to make as much money as possible legally. So while this might sound good, and maybe it will be. Without more details I think we all need to be a hell lot more skeptical when it comes to things like this.

&#x200B;

It's like some random saying they are going to go to the moon. They might be rich or might now. Maybe it's a country or company like Google. But without details, those are just words. 

1. We have no idea how are they going to try to influence laws. 
2. We have no idea if they will push for their exchange above all others.
3. We have no idea if this is a power play.
4. We don't have any idea if this is just another thing with no teeth.

Again, maybe this is a good thing and I hope it is. But I think we all need to be skeptical."

Then there's this guy. Mr Singh. The one who wrote the software.

>According to court filings, he (Mr Singh, red.) wrote the software code that ultimately gave Alameda special treatment on the FTX platform and helped Mr Bankman-Fried backdate financial transactions to make FTX's financial performance look better than it was. 

Mr Singh says he's sorry. The thing about apologies is that if it's about showing your remorse for your own mistakes or to gain sympathy for your own pain and misery, it's fake and useless.

Even though I never lost a dime on FTX, I can sympathize with those who lost money there. After I made a mistake at work, my boss told me to remember that the client doesn't need to know how I feel about the mistake I made. That has stuck with me and taught me to own up to my mistakes. I guess that's why I get so wound up about Mr Singh's half-assed attempt at making it look like he has any feelings for the people who lost their money. 

He's sorry, sure... for getting caught!

Very solid and young user base. I was at some point in top 500 users (measured in upvotes). And the users are really engaged and loyal. 

It is like a community. And if they had moons i would be a rich. 

Clearly r/cryptocurrency / reddit has paved to way for a revolution.

Im just wondering. How complicated is it for (not twitter, but also smaller media outlets) to implement this? 

And do you guys expect there will be native tokens for all these media outlets? They will set this up all individually? Or will a big player develop itself to provide the infrastucture for them? 

I would assume its safer if individual company's try to sent something up themselves. Also, if a bigger player combines multiple media outlets with the infrastucture this can create a collective power to the token value. 

In an attempt to provide some structure to this brainfart:

Moons is the way but:
Will we end up with tokens for whatever media outlet we have an account? 
Will there be a more general (social) media coin? (Or is there already something out there / going that direction?

1/3/23,"Shill the project you believe in the most, without revealing any information which might identify the project.","EDIT: I have inadvertently created a bot honeypot.

The goal is to get a pure discussion on tech without any of the psychological mishaps stemming from the biases we all have to our favorite projects and the impulse to shill them. I am sure if you read something compelling and want  to know what it is DMing that person  will easily reveal it - or just do some research.

I'll start:

Blockchains get their security from 'cost of attack,' and it is basically related to how much money is being spent trying to earn rewards on the network. The more people paying to use the network or purchase the underlying asset, the higher the cost of attack - this is why Bitcoin is the most secure. The issue with many different blockchains is that security doesn't at all add up between them; one blockchain with all the money/resources put towards it is always more secure than multiple chains splitting that cost. If any blockchain subject to a 51% attack (I don't know any which are not except for this one) is attacked by a sophisticated enough attacker who gains 51% control, they can keep control forever, barring some drastic protocol change. It's for these reasons I have a lot of worry about these very valid Web3 use cases often times putting another new chain behind their vision.

The reason they do this is the same reason valid DeFi projects often have tokens that you can't figure out the use case of: the only real way to pay the developers/inventors is to invent a currency, give them a large share of it upfront, and justify its existence. There are many applications which could have just been an Ethereum contract you pay gas fees to use - but that would not drive speculation in a new currency and would not pay the devs. Even if the contract had a function to pay a small percentage to the devs, someone would copy/paste it without that. So in a way we've come full circle to your original skepticism: all of these projects have a blockchain attached to them so the devs have a way to make money off of the associated currency and be rewarded for their work; understandable, but a problem none the less.

If there is only to be one blockchain (so security is not scattered and weak) then it should be the one that is the most scalable without compromising on security or openness (like many chains attempting to scale do i.e. Solana). Almost all blockchains use a security function which is unrelated to scale and face the issue of increasing the funding towards scale by decreasing the funding towards security. These issues have been identified as known economic problems:

   * The Tragedy of The Commons
   * The Free Rider Problem

The ""one blockchain to rule them all"" can accumulate security and offer the lowest fee per byte rate since the same costs paid to secure the network are those which scale it. The other issue: developers getting paid; it will sound too good to be true after all this, but it solves that as well. Any node which hosts applications that generate transaction fees will receive the larger share of those transaction fees (half of the fees pay for the hash lottery system which I won't go into, though one result is that there is no longer a possible 51% attack). There is a question as to copy-pasting applications other people wrote and getting the funds yourself - but at the very least the most well-made iteration of software will get used more and rewarded more. Because the chain rewards those providing access to applications, developers and infrastructure providers don't need to invent currencies or centralized business models in order to profit.

So for specific Web3 use cases I imagine serious projects will eventually piggy-back off of this chain's security by using it as their backbone. That doesn't mean solving the problems those projects are set out for is easy - there is still a lot of genius cryptography to be applied and developed, but for any project looking for immutability, scale and openness I believe they are much better off using a single chain with robust security which rewards them for providing access to applications rather than having to invent a new chain with fractured security in order for project developers to be paid."

1/3/23,FTX Survivor LedgerX Dumps Silvergate for Signature Bank: Report - Decrypt,
1/3/23,"Two years ago, Square from Jack Dorsey bought as one of first big companies Bitcoin, today they are one of the only that did not paper-hand. Showing that “good“ institutional adoption is possible.","Institutional adoption of Crypto has always been a very difficult topic between Crypto investors. During the bull market, everyone wanted big institutions to enter Crypto because that would pump the prices up, but now that all the tourists have left the remaining ones think that it is rather negative as institutional money can manipulate the markets too much.

Tow years back when the first companies started thinking about Crypto and it was just the early days of the bull market, Square, the company from former  Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey bought another $170M of BTC for their stake. Today they can be seen as an example for “good“ institutional adoption.

&#x200B;

[Picture from pete\_rizzo on Twitter](https://preview.redd.it/jn7cmugvz5la1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=51d1646603af33c6040eac96219365a8cd39bcdb)

On the other hand we have companies like Tesla that bought way more Bitcoin but also paper-handed as we entered the bull market.

My point here is that institutional adoption is not always bad and the people investing from there are not always just in for the money but some are also actually in for the tech. Square and more popularly MicroStrategy has been pushing for actual crypto adoptions. And we can not stop them from entering Crypto anyway.

So do you still think that institutional adoption is always bad?"

1/3/23,Scammer tried calling me to verify the authenticity of my Ledger,"Hey Crypto Friends!

Beware! I know most of you will know this is a scam right away, but I wanted to post this just in case. I received a phone call quite recently from somebody pretending to be with Ledger. The person was a tad difficult to understand because of his accent, but here is how it went----The guy called and asked for me by name. He said he was calling from Ledger and that there had been some problems with some orders and he wanted to verify I had received my Ledger and verify the authenticity of it. I didn't stay on the phone with him long, because Ledger would never call me to verify the authenticity of my device. 

But here is why I bet this person scams some people. 1. The call came a bit late in the evening for a company to call. So immediately I wanted to get the call over with and I was a bit tired. This was probably done on purpose, thinking maybe I'd be less cautious at this hour. 2. The person knew my name and either knew I had a Ledger or else just guessed I might because he probably got my info from some crypto-business related hack. 3. The person added immediate fear into my mind by  implying maybe somehow my Ledger was fake. 

While I have received a ton of scam emails and maybe even a few scam texts related to crypto, this is the first time I received such a phone call. Ledger's website says they will never contact you via text or phone call. So, clearly this was a scammer. Be careful people of these sorts of scams. The person wants to make you scared that something is wrong and that you need to act quickly to protect your crypto. Don't fall for it."
1/3/23,When is the next Bullrun?,"My prediction is that the next bullrun wont come before 2024. We may get a hype with the next bitcoin halving but in my opinion we need many more stuff to trigger the next bullrun.

First of all, because of inflation, russia-ukraine war etc. we have a huge uncertainty. A black swan can occur any moment like a radioactive or nuclear war. So until these problems clear out I think that a bullrun is very unlikely. 

On the other hand, with the inflation we should expect bitcoin to go up as it is like “digital gold”. Nearly in every country living cost is increasing and so should bitcoin, because so much money is being printed.

In conclusion, I dont expect a bullrun before 2024 or maybe when the ukraine war ends it may trigger a bullrun, so I guess we have to keep DCAing into good projects for while more.

When do you think the next bullrun will come?

1/3/23,"According to You, What are the Three Most Essential Components of a Perfect Crypto World?","Title says it all, but let's have a couple perimeters:

1) Things that are completely out of our control, or things that are essentially impossible (i.e. war no longer exists, humans can teleport, etc.) do not count.

2) Things that become a byproduct of crypto (i.e. world poverty is solved, etc) also do not count.

In other words, what three main elements are needed for crypto to flourish in our world?

For me, it is:

1) Regulation of CEXs (we need places we can trust and are easy to use, so easy our grandmas can use them); 

2) Standardized qualifications for new coins entering the space (we don't need 10,000 meme coins);

3) The inevitable taxes we have to pay on our crypto go toward the safety and protection of our blockchains (our governments use our crypto tax to protect our crypto).

So what do you all think are the three most essential components of a perfect crypto world?"

1/3/23,Does Anonymity Help or Hinder Privacy in the Digital Age?,"Privacy is an important aspect of our lives that many people hold dear. It allows individuals to keep certain aspects of their lives hidden from the public eye, and it is an essential component of maintaining personal security. However, with the advent of the internet and the rise of social media, privacy has become increasingly difficult to maintain. As such, many individuals have turned to anonymity as a way of protecting their privacy. But does anonymity really help privacy, or does it simply provide a way for fraud actors to exploit others?

Anonymity has become a key feature of many online platforms, particularly in the crypto space. Many people choose to use anonymous accounts to protect their identities and keep their financial transactions private. However, this anonymity also creates an environment where fraud actors can operate with relative ease. The lack of accountability and the difficulty in identifying individuals using anonymous accounts makes it easier for these actors to engage in fraudulent activities.

While anonymity may help protect an individual's privacy in some cases, it is not a foolproof solution. In fact, anonymity can often make it more difficult for individuals to protect their privacy. For example, if an individual uses an anonymous account to make a financial transaction, it may be more difficult to verify the transaction's authenticity. This can make it easier for fraud actors to engage in scams or other fraudulent activities.

Moreover, anonymity often creates an environment where people feel comfortable engaging in inappropriate or harmful behavior. This can lead to cyberbullying, online harassment, and other negative behaviors that can harm individuals' privacy and security.

However, there are situations where anonymity can be a powerful tool for protecting privacy. For example, whistleblowers who need to expose wrongdoing may need to remain anonymous to avoid retribution. In such cases, anonymity can provide a vital means of protecting these individuals' privacy and safety.

Ultimately, the decision to use anonymity as a means of protecting privacy depends on the situation. In some cases, anonymity may be a valuable tool for safeguarding personal information and transactions. In other cases, it may be more beneficial to use other privacy-enhancing technologies or techniques that do not rely on anonymity.

In conclusion, while anonymity can be useful in protecting privacy in some cases, it is not a panacea. It is important for individuals to carefully consider their options when it comes to protecting their privacy and security online. They must also be aware of the risks associated with anonymity and take steps to mitigate those risks whenever possible. With the right approach and the right tools, it is possible to protect privacy in the digital age without resorting to anonymity.

As an additional resource, here is a link to a song that explores some of the issues surrounding privacy and anonymity in the digital age: https://youtu.be/A70AFyOuKnc. The song offers a unique perspective on the topic and may be useful in sparking further discussions and debates."
1/3/23,Do not be “exit liquidity” in the next bull run: How have you prepared for the next bull market?,"First off, I hope that we do not see any super bullish behavior in the market for at least 12 months. This is accumulation time!

After not taking in profit in the last bull run, which I obviously regret as many of you here, I set out to make myself a plan on how to take profits and not be stupid again. This weekend I sat down and made myself I nice little list with specific price targets and goals for the next bull run. 

Please give me feedback on the rules that I set for myself and tell me if I am being stupid:

* Up 10% -> take out 2% for profits 
* Up 50% on an alt -> take out 10% profits and put those in BTC and ETH
* Up 100% on alt -> take out 50% of initial investment
* Up 200% -> take out initial investment 
* Up 300% or more on an alt -> move on and take out the initial investment and 40% profits and stick it into BTC and ETH

Do you think that I am being too aggressive or conservative? It is a bull market of course, so gains might be even larger at one point.

I think everyone should have at least a rough plan of how to approach the next bull market. Yes we love to meme dca and hodl forever but its almost important to remember that: this time will be different…

In the end it is all easier said than done but it is good to have a plan!"

28/2/23,Would the integration of crypto into games like GTA really benefit the user gaming experience?,"I read some posts here in the subreddit today that video game publishers should integrate crypto into their games. Whether as in-game currency or items that are to be included as NFTs in the games. 

Maybe this is an unpopular opinion, but **I don't think that NFTs or the integration of crypto as a currency would be good for most games**, because it could somehow also **take the fun out of it** and make a lot of things very complicated, which in itself should act as a **balance to everyday life**.

If I take **GTA 6** as an example, how would the integration of NFTs **benefit the user's gaming experience**?

I personally like to play games with friends after work or university to just **relax** a bit and forget about everyday life and switch off, you could say. If I now have to constantly **worry** about whether the price of the car I bought in GTA is going to fall or rise and whether I shouldn't rather sell it, this would **take away from the fun of the game** and for me the **whole point of gaming is to have fun**.  
When tuning my cars, would I then also have to think about whether modification A would possibly be better for me monetarily than modification B, because when I buy the modification I change my NFT and trigger a transaction on the blockchain, or how could this for example work with tuning cars without every modification being final?

I understand that integrating crypto into games like GTA would probably get a lot of people interested in crypto, but **not everything in life is about money** and having to think about assets and money even **while pursuing your hobby seems really stressful**.   
You hear it from a lot of e-sportlers who start a game for fun and lose the fun of the game with the money because at some point it's **just work** for them - of course it's not 100% comparable but hopefully it illustrates the point I'm trying to get across.

I have also tried some of these ""***play-to-earn***"" games and the focus of these games was always **to make money** \- without this point I would **never** have played these games **regularly**.   
I would love to be convinced otherwise in the future, but right now I find it hard to imagine that integrating crypto will improve most of the games I play.

1/3/23,How to retire like a degenerate: Solo 401(k)'s for dummies,"For those of us that are in crypto for both the TECH and the MONEY, and you plan to hold your bags for the long term, it might be worth looking into a ""Solo 401(k).""

If you already have an employer matched 401k, unfortunately this route will not be an option for you. Solo 401(k)s are typically used by small business owners (with no full-time employees) and the self-employed that want to look beyond stocks, bonds and other traditional assets.

The main differences between a traditional 401(k) and a Solo 401(k) is the amount of control that you have over your investments. In a Solo 401(k), you can invest in pretty much any appreciating asset; like crypto, precious metals, stamps, collectors items, mutual funds, real estate, and really any other alternative investments. Your average 401(k) administrator will not give you this option, because they have no way to make money on your self-directed assets, and generally crypto falls outside of their set of pre-approved investment choices. 

Advantages:   
1. Your 401(k) contributions are deducted from your gross annual income, meaning you lower your tax liability for the year in which you invest.  
2. With a Solo 401(k), the account owner has more freedom to invest in non-traditional assets (such as cryptocurrency).  
3. If you sell your cryptocurrency for a profit (hahaha) within your 401(k) and incur capital gains over time, the investment earnings will grow tax-deferred over your working years until when you withdraw money in retirement.  
4. ""Checkbook Control"" - As the trustee of your Solo 401(k) you get to make investments without custodian consent.

Disadvantages:  
1. If you were looking to use your gains to fund your lavish lifestyle, going on vacations and partying in Dubai, this isn't the investment vehicle for you. Any gains must be kept within the 401(k) and all investments are made for the exclusive benefit of the retirement account.  
2. Solo 401(k)s may require higher fees than traditional 401(k)s because of the increased complexity and administrative burden.  
3. There are almost 20,000 different cryptocurrencies that are available today, and its unlikely that most of them will survive the next 4 years, let alone until most of us reach retirement age.  DYOR and make sure you are making a sound investment for your future not a moonshot for next year.  
4. Because you are in control of your portfolio, you must be more diligent in monitoring your portfolios performance.

There are a few different options to setup your Solo 401(k). I can't say for certain which route is best, that will depend on your individual situation."

Documentary revolves around the UK money/banking system but it's not very much different from the other 1st world countries.


It's easy to understand why crypto can't just willy nilly take over the finances, that would create a huge problem worldwide. At the same time it shows that 97% of money in the UK is digital/made up anyway. 


So now I better understand why decentralisation using crypto is a very good thing, but the switch can't happen without major consequences. It's all good wanting to get rid of the banks but that means that real livelihoods are on the line and A LOT of them. How the hell does this need to go to make for a smooth transition?"

1/3/23,Pros and cons of ICP and why I still think it's the most exciting blockchain innovation in years!,"Yes, ICP is more centralized than ETH and BTC on the network layer.  
I'd like you to understand the reasoning as to why I still made ICP my largest investment after being in this space for 10+ years. The fact that ICP has their consensus executed by servers in datacenters around the world opens up a more plausible attack on the network.   
If it was just about financial transactions I'd probably just use Ethereum or Bitcoin.  
The reason why I still am so excited about ICP is because it opens up a whole new set of use cases, where the current alternatives are 100 % centralized. Those use cases are primarily decentralized data storage and messaging.   
Read this [article](https://exwqn-uaaaa-aaaaf-qaeaa-cai.raw.ic0.app/AdamYowo/2112/decentralized-cloud-and-message-services-on-icp-lets-explore-6-unique-dapps) if you want to know the nuances. I much rather have my mail on dmail than on gmail or my cloud on metabox than on dropbox. Many would also argue that there's a need for decentralized social media. ICP dapps aim to ensure more user ownership and less ability to censor speech by centralized decision makers. These are the primary reasons why I am excited about ICP, you can't have an [oc.app](https://oc.app) on-chain on Ethereum, I promise you. And in practice most decentralized apps on Ethereum aren't really decentralized as we all know, we know the frontends are hosted on AWS and that the RPC's logs and sell user data. You get rid of that whole issue with dapps on ICP since the frontend is hosted directly from the canister smart contracts. It also opens up for a much more userfriendly way to interact with the blockchain for regular people who don't want to download a plugin wallet. I dare anyone to go to a website like [dscvr.one](https://dscvr.one) and choose to log in with NFID and then telling me that experience wasn't 10x better than using Metamask or equivalent.

This is my reasoning, you are allowed to disagree with me, but I think it's not just frustrating but also kinda sad that this community have become so tribal against ICP. I still hold other cryptos like ETH and I will probably always do since it has it's place, it is more decentralized on the network layer, so for some use cases it is more optimal. In my eyes they aren't really competitors, [vitalik himself described it in a good way](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/e-y1pLkIcFE), a potential sister-networks. But then as I've presented in this post it is much more limited than ICP in the range of use cases it can handle. ICP dapps does not ensure 100 % decentralization, which in theory nothing really can, but I much prefer it over having AWS or Google in control of all the data, as is the current state. At some point in the future when the nodes of ICP are even more distributed I wouldn't be surprised if the network could assure next to bullet-proof decentralization, even if this is not the case it's still much more decentralized than the alternatives for the use cases I've mentioned.   
I recently listened to a [space](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1kvJpmnjVObxE?s=20) with well informed views of both sides of the argument, it's very informational for those who genuinely care about the underlying technology and are not driven by tribalism.  
These are the things that I find most exciting about ICP, but there are a lot of other things going on as well, like fully on-chain games, dynamic NFTs and a new way to do native Bitcoin / Ethereum transaction through ICP canisters. Many argue that this is much more safe than classical L1 bridges. I don't know the nuances about this so I'm not going to opinionate on those aspects.  


**Tl;dr - ICP is not as decentralized as ETH / BTC but it allows for completely new use cases which could replace services which today are 100 % centralized. These use cases include mail services, cloud storage and it also opens up a more** [userfriendly way](https://medium.com/dfinity/nfid-the-digital-identity-protocol-7d8a39f7ac85) **to interact with blockchain dapps such as blockchain based social media and games.**"

1/3/23,Moons can change your life!,"Alright, this title is a little click baity, but it’s true. 

Let’s take a moment to appreciate R/Cryptocurrency Moons. 

Thank you to everyone involved in this project. Reddit is doing great things implementing crypto and bringing mass adoption to the space. 

So why should we care about Reddit moons?

Reddit Moons delivers a level playing field in the crypto space. You don’t need to pay to play. If you strike up a good discussion, make a funny post, teach somebody something new, you are rewarded with Moons. 

Anyone can do this. 

Moons are now worth more than 20 other countries currencies! 

This potentially gives people who don’t come from good situation or upbringing a chance to earn more than they could ever imagine, simply conversing with an amazing community.  Could you imagine saying this 10 years ago? People would think you are crazy! 

The ability to earn Moons gives people with mental, physical or social disabilities a chance to earn money and crypto and be apart of a great community. Imagine having a disability, and being told you could make money typing on your phone. This is a game changer. 

Moons are for everybody. Already have a good job? Earn some passive income. 

The ability to swap moons provides us with an opportunity to turn moons into other cryptocurrencies. This is FREE crypto if you don’t value your time put in. This can create a long term growth portfolio if you’re swapping your moons for blue chip coins. 

Remember to keep some moons as well! 

Don’t have any Bitcoin? Trade some moons for Bitcoin. It’s that easy. 

At the time of writing moons are worth .20 cents. USD. 

You can earn up to 10,000 moons per month + Bonus’s. Last distribution a few people earned 22k moons. That’s the equivalent of  $4400USD.  Most people don’t earn that at their day jobs working 80 hours +

Moons are literally giving people who have nothing, a chance at a better life. Is this not what crypto is for? 

I’m not going to get into all the possible future use cases because that’s just speculation, I’m not trying to shill moons or say they’re going to be worth $1.00 or $10.00 cos we simply don’t know, but as of right now I just wanted to give a few examples of how moons can and have already changed peoples lives for the better and can continue to do so for the time being. 

This is what crypto is about."

Binance reportedly appropriated customer assets for its own purposes in a series of moves that present similarities to events leading up to FTX's downfall, according to [Forbes.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/javierpaz/2023/02/27/binances-asset-shuffling-eerily-similar-to-maneuvers-by-ftx/?sh=27672a8bbccd)

The largest crypto exchange in the world reportedly transferred $1.8 billion in stablecoin collateral to hedge funds which subsequently left its investors exposed, according to Forbes, which reviewed on-chain data from August 17 to early December. These investment firms include Alameda Research, the trading arm of FTX. 

Essentially, this means that more than $1 billion worth of the crypto, known as B-peg USDC, were left uncollateralized despite Binance's claims that they were 100% backed, the report reads. 

""Binance does not, and has never, invested or otherwise deployed user assets without consent under the terms of specific products,"" a company spokesperson told Insider in a statement. ""Binance holds all of its clients' assets in segregated accounts which are identified separately from any accounts used to hold assets belonging to Binance.""

In a largely unregulated industry like crypto, the shift in funds may not be illegal, but could pose concern for its investors.

Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX lost more than $8 billion in customer funds after allegedly misusing the crypto exchange's deposits for operations at sister trading firm Alameda. 

The Binance spokesperson added that the blockchain data cited in the report relates to ""internal wallet management"" and did not impact the collateralization of customer assets.

""While Binance has previously acknowledged that wallet management processes for Binance-pegged token collateral have not always been flawless, at no time was the collateralization of user assets affected,"" the spokesperson said. ""Processes for managing our collateral wallets have been fixed on a longer-term basis and this is verifiable on-chain.""

This isn't the first time Binance has faced scrutiny over its business practices.

[Reuters reported](https://www.reuters.com/technology/crypto-giant-binance-moved-400-million-us-partner-firm-managed-by-ceo-zhao-2023-02-16/) earlier this month that Binance had secret access to a bank account belonging to its purportedly independent US partner. The company reportedly sent [$400 million](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/binance-crypto-exchange-secret-transfer-changpeng-zhao-cz-ftx-alameda-2023-2?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets) from the account to a trading firm that was managed by Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. 

The world's largest crypto exchange has also reportedly faced a slew of legal and regulatory probes, which includes investigations from the SEC and the Justice Department.  "
1/3/23,Let’s brainstorm here. How can we get more female energy in the crypto space? Could Moons be the answer? I believe it’s possible,"As you all are painfully aware, there are not many women in the crypto space. I know there are a few Youtubers, but I think a lot of them are just doing it as our shills.  

When I say more females I mean organically growing the number of women genuinely interested in the concepts and tech.

I can clearly see an enterprising woman creating a subreddit or platform with a similar model as Moons and gobbling up a massive piece of a relatively untapped pie.

Could moons attract a better sense of female energy into our beloved, crypto space?  

Women are clever, and they’re smart and we should want them in the space.  I am assuming most of you are men.  I don’t think I’m being an ass for making that assumption.

How could we popularize Moons with more women?  Let me know your thoughts!

1/3/23,How to wind down BlueWallet (noncustodial),"I currently run an LND routing node, and also have BlueWallet set up with a sub-set of the funds from that node (on chain and lightning wallets in BlueWallet, using LND Hub). I'd like to stop using BlueWallet and switch to Zeus, but I'm unclear what needs to be done, if anything, to ""close out / cash out"" Bluewallet.

I never really understood what LND Hub actually does. Is it literally just an accounting system where I don't even need to cash out of BlueWallet? If I just uninstall the app, are all the funds sitting on my routing node anyway, or do I have to first drain both the on-chain and lightning wallet within Bluewallet by sending them to my node directly prior to uninstall of the BlueWallet app?

To be clear I'm not using BlueWallet's node that's being retired, I'm using my own node via LNDHub. Thanks for any clarification!

As an aside - BlueWallet's actually a great wallet, as is Zeus. I switched from Zeus to BW back when I was trying to be a larger routing node and I didn't want Zeus fully controlling the entire node's hot wallet from my phone. Now that the Lightning Network is more established and I can't hang with modern routing nodes anyway, I've paired down my funds and now want to go back to controlling the whole balance with Zeus."

1/3/23,A note on banks and swaps.,"After reading [this recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/11eiuh4/spoke_to_a_wells_fargo_risk_analyst_about_his/) posted thread... There some points to be made about the space.

The topic is a bit muddled, but let's look at how a large portion of global dollars move around today... and why Bitcoin is almost an antithesis to the way money currently functions. 

TLDR; we're going to detail how global bank balance sheets enable wholesale global banking (how the money moves around). Largely using a [2017 report from the BIS](https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1709.htm)... and then an opinion as to why Bitcoin would not be desirable (by banks) to replace this function.

----going long.

Ok, per the post:

>Big banks move so much money buying and selling bonds, equities, *Forex, repo markets etc.* that just the SHEER AMOUNT involved in each these transactions automatically triggers slow legacy financial reporting procedures.

How much money is moved around daily? Trillions. And how is it accomplished? Repo is one, another major method is currency swaps/synthetic repo. No one really tracks these; and they are only reported in the notes of bank's balance sheets. [Example of recording repo/derivatives - JP Morgan Chase financials PDF - pages 167, 186, 189, 192, 199, 289 - Note 29, etc.](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmc/jpmorgan-chase-and-co/investor-relations/documents/audited-financial-statements-2021.pdf)

You'll see wording re: ""off balance sheet"" items, and ""re-pledgable collateral"" (this is the [collateral multiplier](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1148qnp/fractional_reserve_banking_pfff/) as viewed via one participant's balance sheet). 

Some swap transactions aren't recorded because their values are effectively nil... however the notes for a Canadian bank would still have to explain how a bank in Canada can have CAD denominated liabilities offsetting USD assets... and may indicate that a swap has taken place. 

The BIS aggregated a bunch of bank's balance sheets to try and capture how much swap debt exists... Essentially, how large this global funding market is (shadow banking market). This was not a full activity, and was limited to the banks surveyed. 

>**Every day, trillions of dollars are borrowed and lent in various currencies**. Many deals take place in the cash market, through loans and securities. **But foreign exchange (FX) derivatives, mainly FX swaps, currency swaps and the closely related forwards, also create debt-like obligations. For the US dollar alone, contracts worth tens of trillions of dollars stand open and trillions change hands daily.** **And yet one cannot find these amounts on balance sheets. This debt is, in effect, missing.**

Except that it's not missing. These credit created dollars are circulating around the world. They are the cause of M2 skyrocketing from the 1970s through to 2007 despite low Fed reserve levels. These dollars are ""created"" as banks expand their balance sheets... sometimes enabled by selectively transacting off-balance sheet. The same tools can be used to continue to access funding while limiting new commercial loan origination (banks can swap amongst themselves, vs. lending to the broader public to achieve returns). 

As an example, we can look at Japan. The endless QE regime was supposed to provoke Japanese banks to lend and spur inflation. That inflation never arrived for over 20 years. A Japanese bank could engage in an fx swap, swap Yen for USD and roll that into treasuries. Now the Japanese bank could reap UST yields... avoiding the negative rates they're subject to domestically. All while playing it safe, and not lending to the broader public (ignoring the intention of the Bank of Japan). 

Anyway.. going off on too much of a tangent. Suffice to say... repo, swaps, other derivatives also function as balance sheet tools. Re-jigging assets and liabilities to allow for further business activity *in spite of reserve requirements, or domestic limitations*.

>As a result, **we know little about it**. How much is owed, by whom and for what purpose: trade hedging, asset-liability management, market-making? What does it imply for measures of international credit like the BIS global liquidity indicators (GLIs)? Answers to these questions can inform assessments of global financing conditions and financial stability. For instance, serious strains seized the FX swap market during the Great Financial Crisis (GFC).

There you have it. The BIS (the central bank's central bank) admitting that they can't measure money. Confidence inspiring, ain't it?

This is also why 2007/2008 was such a blindside. These markets have been ignored (and largely continue to be). 

>The debt remains obscured from view. Accounting conventions leave it mostly off-balance sheet, as a derivative, even though it is in effect a secured loan with principal to be repaid in full at maturity. Only footnotes to the accounts report it.

As stated earlier (and can check the previously linked example bank balance sheet as a reference). 

>Focusing on the dominant dollar segment, we estimate that non-bank **borrowers outside the United States have very large off-balance sheet dollar obligations in FX forwards and currency swaps**. They are of a size similar to, and **probably exceeding, the $10.7 trillion of on-balance sheet debt. On the other side of the ledger, as much as two thirds of the dollar-denominated bonds issued by non-US residents could be hedged through similar off-balance sheet instruments.** That fraction seems to have fallen as emerging market borrowers have gained prominence since the GFC.

$10T is on balance sheet. The BIS continues to report on this dollar market.. with recent size estimates of over [$80T](https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt2212h.htm). (It's likely over $100T+ today)

Note the key words here ""other side of the ledger"", USD denominated debt *not issued in the US*, also being pledged as collateral for similar activities... and not included in the $10T estimate in 2017. 
 
>**The implications for financial stability are hard to assess**. This requires a more granular analysis of currency and maturity mismatches than the available data allow. Much of the missing dollar debt is likely to be hedging FX exposures, which, in principle, supports financial stability. Even so, **rolling short-term hedges of long-term assets can generate or amplify funding and liquidity problems during times of stress.**

>Three closely related instruments **allow off-balance sheet foreign currency borrowing and lending**: FX swaps, currency swaps and (outright) forwards. In an FX swap, two parties exchange two currencies spot and commit to reverse the exchange at some pre-agreed future date and price. Currency swaps are like FX swaps, except that the two parties agree to exchange both principal and interest payment streams over a longer term. FX swaps mature within a year (providing “money market” funding); currency swaps have a longer maturity (“capital market” funding). A forward is a contract to exchange two currencies at a pre-agreed future date and price. After a swap’s spot leg is done, what is left is the agreed future exchange – the forward leg. 

>**These transactions are functionally equivalent to borrowing and lending in the cash market. Yet the corresponding debt is not shown on the balance sheet and thus remains obscured.** 

In simpler terms; this activity moves (and creates) dollars on balance sheets... dollars that are used in the real world, but the obligation tied to these dollars is unreported. 

>Why such a difference in accounting treatment? One reason is that forwards and swaps are treated as derivatives, so that only the net value is recorded at fair value, while repurchase transactions are not. Since the value of the forward claim exchanged at inception is the same, the fair value of the contract is zero and it changes only with variations in exchange rates. Yet, unlike with most derivatives, the full notional amount, not just a net amount as in a contract for difference, is exchanged at maturity. That is, the notional amounts are not purely used as reference for the income streams to be exchanged, such as in interest rate derivatives. **Another reason is the definition of control, which for cash requires control over the cash itself (eg a demand deposit) but for a security just the right to the corresponding cash flows**. This determines what is recognised and not recognised on the balance sheet.

This is important to note. The ""money"" here isn't cash, isn't a demand deposit. It's just ledger entries... which comprise all money (physical cash/deposits are just a partial form and all ledger dollars are hypothetically convertible to them). 

The framing of ""control"" applies to the underlying collateral, which need not change hands to have a valid claim over. 

>This makes it very difficult to measure the debt and funding involved. The balance sheets show only the final outcome of a series of swap and forward transactions. As the box outlines, this shows as an apparent currency mismatch. For instance, if a bank swaps its home currency for dollars, its dollar assets end up exceeding its dollar liabilities. **Moreover, for highly active dealer banks, the balance sheet shows only the net result of a possibly huge number of deals for dealer banks very active in the market.**

More stress on the fact that these tools for moving money are really for manipulating balance sheets. Dealers are less constrained by off balance sheet activity. 

>**The dollar reigns supreme in FX swaps and forwards. Its share is no less than 90%** (Graph 2), **and 96% among dealers** (Table 1). **Both exceed its share in denominating global trade (about half) or in holdings of official FX reserves (two thirds). In fact, the dollar is the main currency in swaps/forwards against every currency.** For instance, it predominates in forwards in the Norwegian krone, the Swedish krona and the Polish zloty, currencies that trade in the spot market more against the euro.6/

This is key. The dollar is a global unit. It denominates the bulk of global trade. The amount of those dollars is well beyond the ability of the Fed to measure.. and are *disconnected* from Fed reserve levels. 

>**FX swaps were a key part of non-US banks’ total US dollar funding**, amounting to an estimated $0.6 trillion, roughly 6% of the total in March 2017 (Graph 4). The rest, about $9.4 trillion, mostly took the form of deposits from US and non-US non­banks (red and blue areas), and dollar debt securities (yellow area)

>Who, then, lends dollars to non-US banks via the FX swap market? **Four candidates** are: US banks, central banks, European agencies and supranational organisations, and private non-banks. All of these appear to provide some funding, **with US banks and central banks together closing about half the gap**

Note the language here, and the attempt to tie dollar funding to the US and central banks. It's a guess (""candidates"", and ""appear""s), and even generously.. dollar funding originating from the US only approaches *half* of the total. In reality... it's far less.

Dollar funding is provided by the broader wholesale global market. It is the activity of all banks, bank-like institutions, dealers, across the world. It is often called shadow banking, or the eurodollar market. 

.....

Anyway, getting to why Bitcoin would not be adopted by banks for global funding activities:

It isn't necessarily a matter of regulation, or the encumbrance of legacy reporting systems. It's that Bitcoin doesn't allow for the flexibility (chicanery) of the current ledger system.

The current monetary system has evolved in such a way as to be dependent upon bypasses to ensure continued ability to supply dollars globally. 

The commercial banking system relies on accounting ""tricks"", and their perceptions of risk to manage money.... and one doesn't even need to point to 2007/8 to prove they've been irresponsible in both areas. 

A hard ledger precludes this."

1/3/23,Interview: Nicholas Gregory on Mercury Wallet & Adding a Lightning Network Integration,
1/3/23,"Will there ever be viable lending and borrowing, using only Bitcoin as the currency involved? If so, how would that be possible and how could it work, given the implied future deflation of the currency.","One very important (arguably the most important) economic activity, is the allocation of capital from those who have saved it and are not using it, to those who have an idea for it's usage but do not own the capital.  An economy lives by it's ability to efficiently allocate capital, and dies by it's inability to do so.  Bitcoin has extremely heavy implied deflation - all it takes is for a Bitcoiner to die without passing their private key on to their heirs, and that Bitcoin is effectively deflated out of the supply.  

The late doctor's widow who has large amounts saved up but doesn't spend much, meets a young entrepreneur who wants to open a restaurant.  So she lends him some Bitcoin to start it up(Bitcoin is the currency used by everyone).  He agrees to pay her interest at whatever rate they agree on.  But, because Bitcoin continues to get more and more scarce as time goes on....what is the likely outcome of that loan?  As time goes on, it will invariably become harder and harder for him to pay it back.  That restaurant had better be one whole hell of a success, and/or he'd better repay the loan pretty fast.  

Do you see the problem here?  The doctor's wife is incentivized by the nature of Bitcoin, to hodl it.  Not to lend it out.  Because she knows that it will be more valuable tomorrow/next year/ten years into the future....so why take the chance?  She'll likely want a high interest rate as compensation for taking the risk, and that makes it even harder for the young fellow to repay it!  But the lending of capital, which is just the allocation of capital in the economy, is vital to the growth of said economy.  In our hypothetical example, the restaurant won't get built because the Bitcoin wouldn't get lent out.  

My sense tells me that this actually will not be a problem in a Bitcoinized world, but I can't seem to put my finger on the economic reason as to why.  Back to the example - the real capital, and labor, exist to start the restaurant, but won't be allocated to do so.  The grills are there, the building exists, and the workers are ready to go work...but because of the nature of the currency, the decision-makers are incentivized not to proceed....or would they be incentivized to proceed?  

What's the flaw in this argument against Bitcoin?  Because I've heard it before, and just not sure how to refute it to my friends who want to argue this macro-economic angle."

28/2/23,Idea for a Bitcoin credit card service. Is there anything like this?,"So, we all know about overcollateralized loans, what about integrating them into a (physical and/or virtual) credit card service?

If BTC goes down so my collateral reaches a price of $1500, it automatically gets liquidated. I can also close the card at any time and cash out any excess on the value of my collateral BTC above $1500, or simply spend it straight from the card.

1/3/23,** IN SEARCH OF MY LOST BTC **,"So check it out. . .

5 years ago yesterday I made my first BTC transaction at a Coinlinx BTM in Mahwah, NJ - the closest one to me at the time and a 25min border hop from my NY residence.

I purchased 0.1 BTC for around $800, I believe.

Being the noob I was, I realized I had sent it into thin air and had not entered a wallet address.  (SOOOO stupid, I know)

Realizing this, I sent a text to the number on the BTM and the guy was super responsive assuring me ""we can get it.""

Well, stupid me AGAIN put it on the backburner and actually forgot all about it until I went to the BTM again some time later and realized it was a new machine from a new company.

Immediate research showed that Coinlinx is no longer in business.

So, long story short. . . with no receipt, can I get STILL my 0.1 BTC back if I knew the date and location of purchase?

Oh, and a friendly request is I'd prefer insightful answers preferably from someone with intimate BTM knowledge."
1/3/23,Bitcoin as a way to preserve weath across lifetimes,"Join me in a thought experiment. Let us assume that the Afterlife and Reincarnation is real. However, for some unknown reason we keep coming back to this planet to live and start from zero. However, in the future that need not be the case. 


To unlock a Bitcoin wallet all one needs is a 12-24 word seedphrase. And the user can have full access to their funds. 



Now assume that before somebody dies, they load a certain amount of their wealth onto the blockchain and take the seedphrase with themselves to their grave. 



Upon their return, all the need is to go to a past life regression therapist (this will become more common in the future, as it's an evolving field of study, people look at past life regression therapy the way they used to look at mental health therapist 50-years ago) and remember the passphrase to unlock their wallets. And they would have full access to their funds. 


This would be a good way for somebody to ensure their financial stability across lifetimes.

\- Performance Expectancy

\- Effort Expectancy

\- Social Influence

\- Facilitating Conditions

\- Fear of Missing Out

\- Loss Aversion

1/3/23,"Funds being held hostage, support is useless","For weeks now I've been trying to add a bank account as a payment method so I could withdraw my money, and it just doesn't work. I add it automatically with the plaid system, and it tells me that I've successfully added my account, but on the very next screen it says my account was unable to be added and I need to try it manually. I try adding it manually and it still doesn't work.

The name on my bank account exactly matches the name on my coinbase account. I don't owe coinbase any money, didn't get any email/notification that something was wrong with my account or that it isn't in good standing.


I tried calling support and they were basically useless. The essentially told me ""try it again"", and when I did it with them over the phone, they said the only thing they could see is that with Plaid, you can only try adding a bank account every 12 hours, so if it fails you can't try again until that time frame passes.


This makes 0 sense because I've been trying for weeks and it has never worked, regardless of how much time passes in between tries.


The strangest part is that I was able to add my account to do a wire transfer, but there's a $25 fee which I'm trying to avoid.



Does anyone have any suggestions or help they could provide?

So I figured I'd instead transfer it out of Coinbase to another exchange where I could swap it for BTC or ETH, then transfer it back to CB. But even that option is unavailable, as soon as I open up the Rep V2 page on CB and click ""Send/Receive"" the box that pops up is grayed out. It won't even let me transfer it out! I contacted support, and they told me to download the wallet and connect my wallet to my CB account. I did that. It doesn't even show Augur Rep V2 on the wallet, only Rep V1.

1/3/23,Confused with the different Coinbase APIs - which one should I use to convert crypto?,"Hey everyone,

I'm having a bit of trouble figuring out which Coinbase API to use for my needs, and I was hoping someone here could help me out.

I know there are several Coinbase APIs, including the unnamed regular API, the Pro API, Commerce API, Exchange API, and the hidden (it's mentioned but with no examples or api manager)  Advanced Trade API. I'm specifically interested in converting crypto using an API, and I'd prefer to use the unnamed regular Coinbase API if possible, since I was easily able to get it connect and show my balances. 

However, I've noticed that the regular Coinbase API doesn't seem to allow for transactions. Meanwhile, the Pro API does offer transaction capabilities, but I've read that it's being phased out in favor of the Advanced Trade API.

So my question is, which Coinbase API should I use if I want to convert crypto using an API? Should I move my funds to Coinbase Pro, even though it's being phased out? Or is there another API that I should be using instead?

I would really appreciate any advice or guidance that you can offer. Thanks in advance!"

1/3/23,gETH should never cost real value.,"The latest trend of [gETH](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/27/start-of-the-end-testnet-goerli-ether-spikes-to-160-as-traders-jump-on-opportunity-meant-for-developers/%3foutputType=amp) requiring real value for developers and users to get gETH for project test is appalling and leaves a really bad feeling in my stomach. The fact that cryptocurrency is a decentralized space shouldn't be an avenue for greed or become an honeypot.

This new trend will hurt the eth development ecosystem and will likely create a spiral of negative effect on other blockchain projects relying on gETH to advance their research and project developments.

If this trend is not widely condemned by cryptocurrency communities and pushed back, its only a matter of time before growth as we know it in the cryptocurrency space evaporates and we are left with project development getting abandoned due to developers being unable to afford testnet because it cost as much as Mainnet.

Though some options to get free gETH like freetestnetbridge.com are now available, I believe the silence from the community not voicing against this wayward uprising of gETH will come back to bite cryptocurrency development really bad, and we will all be remembered for not stopping this ill trend in its tracks.

28/2/23,predictability of income for liquidity providers on the Solidly platform and how it benefits them.,"Solidly's predictability of income for liquidity providers is a significant benefit for users of the platform. The income stream is defined as a fixed allocation of tokens that are distributed once per week, regardless of trading volume. This ensures that liquidity providers receive a consistent and predictable income, which is not affected by market fluctuations or trading activity.

This predictability of income is especially important for users who are looking to generate passive income from their cryptocurrency holdings especially to holders who wish to hold the native SOLD on exchanges that got it listed like Mexc. With Solidly, liquidity providers can earn a steady stream of tokens without having to constantly monitor market conditions or adjust their investment strategies.

In addition, the fixed emission allocations and LP bribes provided by Solidly help to incentivize liquidity provision and ensure that there is always sufficient liquidity available on the platform. This benefits all users of the platform, as it helps to minimize slippage and improve overall trading conditions.

Overall, Solidly's predictability of income for liquidity providers is a significant advantage for users of the platform, providing a stable and reliable source of income without the volatility and uncertainty often associated with cryptocurrency trading."

1/3/23,Broker Help,"Hey yall, was wondering if anyone could help me understand how brokerage systems work and whether it makes sense for me. Long story short, I've been using trading view to develop a strategy for day trading and want to connect it to a broker. TradeStation (and most other brokers I've looked at) charge a 2$ service fee plus a percentage for trades under $1000 (I want to put in $500 to start.) My current strategy does a lot of small trades, averaging 20 cents per trade. So unless I put $1000+ into my account to begin with, it doesn't make sense for me to try it? Or is anyone aware of a broker that would make sense in my situation?"
