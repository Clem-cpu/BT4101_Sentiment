10/3/23,Magic: The Gathering will release a new set based on this sub! Here are the leaked cards so far,"For those unaware, Magic: The Gathering (MTG henceforth) is one of the most popular card games ever. It currently has over 100 sets, with the first one being released in 1993. Guess what's the theme of the next set? Us!

With the amazing popularity of crypto and the general consensus that it is the best invention in mankind, it seems they have been lurking at this sub and will release a set based on what they saw. Let's have a look at the cards!

Let's get to the good stuff first. The biggest combo leaked is for the aggro players. Just make sure you have Meeleen on the battlefield and play $10 or we riot after the opponent has declared their defending creatures.

One can also try to play full-five colors and let a wild jwinterm on the battlefield:

The best strategy here would be to play it with a Madness deck. With e.g. [Trespasser il-Vec](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=509512) it gets easy to have jwinterm on the battlefield in the third turn of the game. It's a solid win.

Two other cards leaked are Gensler's Decree and Monero. It seems a new card type is coming, which are blockchain enchantments. The hard part here is that I don't get what Monero does:

Finally, two more cards were leaked:

Didn't get what the karma mechanic is yet, but I hope we get more updates in the future!

An interesting aspect is that each card generally has a different artist, but this collection was entirely designed by artist reddito654, which I seriously have no idea who it might be.

EDIT: A new card designed by artist named Chysce has just been revealed:

10/3/23,A brief summary about what happened recently and what to expect.,"You know..crypto tends to be  unpredictable (aka nobody knows a sh\*t) but that's far from knowing what events caused the movements worth nothing. 

OFC if you're pure-DCA-investor you're unaffected for any variation, just stick to your plan and everything will be fine.

Anyway, this type of events use to come abruptly and cause a disruption of the market so being aware in advance is kind of impossible yet their effects may last long enough to help you analyze the environment and make some choices.

As we know BTC has been some sort of undecided hanging around 22-23k  for a week and it uses to be a time where so yes ""it may go up or down"" and a combined hit of bad incidents triggered the red candles.

So here's what happened:

1 Huobi token (HT), which saw a sudden 90% drop in value. This was due to a series of leveraged liquidations by some users.

2 (HBAR), a decentralized PoS ledger, shut down network services citing ""network irregularities,"" fueling rumors of a possible hack.

3  Ethereum has been marked as a security in the lawsuit filed by the New York attorney.

4 Silvergate Bank announced its closure due to a bank run triggered by regulatory concerns over whether its payment network had facilitated thousands of customer transfers from FTX to Alameda Research accounts.

5 President Biden proposed a 30% tax on crypto mining electricity usage

6 Silicon Valley Bank suffered a 60% plunge on Thursday after selling off its bond portfolio worth $21 billion.

&#x200B;

As for 1 and 2 alone imo they're some sort of short events, so could not be further damage.

3 Will be diluted in coming months

4 Has been discussed for some days so far so is some sort of ""expected"".

5 Is just a proposal waiting for confirm

6 Is what really bothers me, a SVB fall has been compared to the Lehman brother's and we know what happened back in the day.

What next¿?

Also did you knew the saying ""don't fight the fed""? It has been a working strategy for a long time, and today new employment rates will be published. Last report's figure was 3,4% and good data would fuel the 50bps rates hike in 2 weeks.

&#x200B;

So there go my points as cryptobro-aNalYst-who-knows-nothing, if you made it to the end it may mean that you're interested and knowing your points will help the community."

10/3/23,"Through this recent dump to below $20k, we just had the highest level of long-term holder capitulation since the FTX collapse.","After some euphoric upwards movements earlier this year of Bitcoin, followed by some boring weeks of nearly no price movements we are now, not-so unexpectedly, taking the elevator down again. While doing so we quickly dropped below the crucial support-areas of $22k and even $20k and also some indicators, like the Supertrend, flashed red again.

Obviously one class that is often affected by such drops are simply the buyers and while we may thing that long-term holders should not sell, in reality long-term holders do sell occasionally. As those are long-term holders sales, they can be a great evidence of how brutal or unexpected a move is.

&#x200B;

[Chart from glassnode and James V.Straten](https://preview.redd.it/0cn731vslyma1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a4d88bae7cb661ad0621ba1836713fb65a3bf8ca)

This graph here shows the selling of long-term holders, specifically we are looking at the amount of BTC being deposited to exchanges from other wallets. Very high possibility that those are sells.

Now we have just hit a new high of long-term holder selling due to the Silverbank and SBV collapse. This selling is at about 12k BTC right now per day, meaning about $240M of long-term holders BTC has been panic-sold. We should be happy to be the remaining long-term holders."
10/3/23,Copium inbound: remember that strangers on the internet don’t know your personal situation,"Anyone with eyes and a phone sees that the market is down bigly over the last week and the economy is in a precarious state. This is quite a flip in sentiment from just 1 month ago when interest rates were raised by 0.25 and BTC was sitting at 22-24k. There were multiple, well though out and laid out posts with TA detailing why the bottom was in and how things aligned up with the traditional 4 year cycle. People were getting hopeful again and then- BAM. 

Now we’re seeing the “this dip is actually good because X” posts or “these are the prices you wished to buy Y at” posts encouraging people to buy more. Truth is, it’s really fucking hard to buy a risky asset in the face of economic uncertainty. It’s perfectly okay for people to not be “loading their bags” right now especially if they’re at risk of losing their job or are struggling in this economic climate. No one truly knows how long the downturn will last and crypto is in uncharted waters from a global economy standpoint. The 4 year cycle may not hold true this go around. Ultimately do what’s best for you and your family in this time and if that means reducing exposure to crypto, that’s okay. It will be here for years to come. 

TL:DR- don’t catch FOMO from posters who claim this is such a great opportunity if you’re struggling right now. They don’t know your situation and there’s no guarantee things play out how others are expecting. We’re just armchair analysts posting on a message board."

Crypto is banned worldwide, and running nodes is illegal.

This would be shocking news to all of us. After crying a bit, we would need to make a move. After all, we have to do something.

Even if it is an unlikely scenario (well, at least I hope so), it is very interesting how we should fight it.

One thing we should keep in mind is that different players will fight differently, from simple degen to institutions. Some player's moves will be driven mostly by greed, some mostly by inner values, but it will probably be by both. Some moves will be social, political, technological, etc. Which do you prefer?

I guess it is safe to assume that privacy and freedom of speech restrictions would rise to another level.

So, what would be your next move? How should the crypto community react?"
10/3/23,Bull trap or bear tap?,"The last few weeks have been full of FUD and now we finally dumped. This was inevitable based on the news. 

Where should we start? 

- Regulation Uncertainty 
- Mt. GOX - Potential dump
- Silvergate Bank. 
- Ethereum Upgrade + Release of staked Ether. 
- War in Ukraine 
- Biden Budget 
- Current state of economy. 
- Silicon Valley bank 
- The Fed increasing rates (maybe)
- Job market still hot

Last week I posted a similar analysis and I wasn’t certain we would go this low. I was wrong, but the plan is still the same. 

Generally, when we reach a point of fear and maximum FUD in this Subreddit or on social media. We signal a bottom, or close to. I don’t think we are at maximum fear anymore but we are still very fearful as a group based on the news coming out. Which is reasonable. 

We are now in times if uncertainty. These recent pumps can wreck havoc on investor emotions. Do we sell the pump and get out for good, maybe we never hit a new all time high? 

Don’t fall for this psychological trap you set for yourself. 

The emotions are brutal and hard to manage. Luckily, these emotions you’re feeling often signal the end of a bear run and the beginning of a long accumulation phase.

Remember: 

By the time everyone is calling for a recession, we are usually already recovering. There is a reason why 99% of people fail at managing their own investments. They enter way to late. 

The stock market and Bitcoin are strongly correlated, as much as we would like this to stop. It likely won’t anytime soon.

The SP500 Is a reliable indicator to see where we are in the market and we just broke out of a 420 day down trend with a huge retest of the trend line. We are now slightly below this support line. We also have daily golden crosses across multiple big funds, all which signal a sustained uptrend. 

We often fall below key trend lines when whales stop loss hunt. This creates massive fear and huge sell offs. This is a common bear trap scenario. 

The DXY has completed a daily bearish cross and is also in a sustained down trend. This is historically very bullish for crypto. Today the DXY is dumping. 

It is reasonable to feel bearish in this current environment, but it’s good practice to do the opposite of what you feel. No matter how you view the economic state or the current market, we have a lot of good social and technical indicators signalling the start of a new bull run coming soon. This will take a long time to play out of course, but the bull run has to start somewhere. 

We have had plenty of coordinated attacks on crypto and big shake outs before this is nothing new. The Bitcoin fundamentals are still the same. 

So what are your thoughts? 

Was bitcoins move to 23k a bull trap, or is this dump a huge bear trap?"

We've seen images like these from countries around the world but many people who live in the global north have dismissed them as only something that happens in third world countries. Seeing it in the US will be a wake up call for many.

Although this has also caused the price of crypto to plummet, holding your crypto on your personal hardware wallet still seems preferable to lining up outside of a bank hoping to be able to withdraw your money.

10/3/23,[SERIOUS] Why the proposed 30% electricity tax for crypto mining is completely backwards and harmful for the US,"I’m sure you’ve heard about the latest budget proposal by President Biden that aims to impose a 30% tax on electricity costs for US crypto miners. This is a terrible idea that will not only hurt the crypto industry but also the US economy and innovation.
Imo this tax is unfair and discriminatory. Why should crypto miners pay more for electricity than other industries that use a lot of power? This tax would create an uneven playing field and discourage investment and innovation in crypto mining. It would also make US miners less competitive globally, as other countries have lower or no taxes on electricity for mining.

Not only that but this tax is ineffective and counterproductive. The stated goal of this tax is to reduce mining activity and its environmental impact. However, this tax would not achieve that goal. Instead, it would drive miners to use more renewable energy sources or move their operations offshore. This would reduce the tax revenue for the US government and increase its dependence on foreign energy sources.
Also I find this tax is shortsighted and ignorant. Crypto mining is not just a waste of electricity. It is a vital process that secures the network, validates transactions, and creates new coins. Crypto mining also supports innovation and development in blockchain technology, which has many potential applications beyond finance. Crypto mining is a key driver of economic growth, job creation, and social impact in the US.

I am worried that with laws like this security of networks and in a way global assets like BTC will move to other countries who can then control the network, effectively harming the decentralised aspect of it.

TL;DR: The proposed 30% electricity tax for crypto mining is unfair, ineffective, counterproductive, shortsighted, and ignorant. It will hurt the US crypto industry and economy. We should oppose it and support crypto mining instead.

What is your opinion?"

10/3/23,"US Gov appealing Bankruptcy Judge's approval of Voyager sale to Binance US is pathetic. The gov is actively trying to prevent people from being made whole. ""Protecting investors"" is nothing but a smokescreen","The US gov just appealed the Bankruptcy Judge's decision to approve Voyager's sale to Binance. 

Under the approved sale, Voyager’s customers would see an estimated 73% recovery in dollar terms. 97% of Voyager's customers are in favor of the decision. 

Yet, the US gov after trying to block it in bankruptcy court and being overruled, is now taking this to appeals court.

If the deal is blocked, Voyager assets will have to be liquidated and they are likely to get a much lower recovery amount. 

These are the words of the judge:

> ""Things have to be done. We have creditors who are waiting and who in the midst of all of this uncertainty have no access to property in which they’ve invested, in some cases, their life savings, so we have to take some kind of action""


This appeal has major repercussions for all the other bankruptcy proceedings as well - Celsius, FTX and any others - it simply says if the party acquiring assets and bailing out customers is not favorable to the government, they will try to block the deal. It doesnt matter if no party or company favorable to the government wants to pick up the tab. In that case, the government will rather let people suffer than allow the sale to an entity they dont favor 

Creditors stuck in these bankruptcy proceedings are at the mercy of a government that is visibly anti-crypto and opposed to any kind of relief for the creditors. 

No action of the government is aimed at ""protecting investors"", unlike what frauds like Gary Gensler trumpet at every occasion. In this case, its plainly obvious - investors have their funds stuck with Voyager, the Bankruptcy Judge found Binance US deal acceptable and entered an order finalizing the deal, yet the government seeks to appeal and block it knowing well that the alternative remedy for creditors involves getting a much smaller payout after additional delay that could stretch to several months if not years."

Out of their banks, Silvergate is already bust (winding up) and Silicon Valley bank is just shut down by regulators after it collapsed. 

We do not know how much is held at SV bank, but assuming they split their 8bn equally, it would be an exposure of around $1bn. This is just an estimate.

10/3/23,99.88% of money laundering transactions had been done with fiat. Yet various governments claimed that crypto is the currency for criminals.,"Money laundering is nothing new in history. It is the process of converting money from illegal activities into legitimate sources.

In a press conference at the White House, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin claimed:

 *“Cryptocurrencies such as* *Bitcoin* *have been exploited to support billions of dollars of illicit activity like cybercrime, tax evasion, extortion, ransomware, illicit drugs, and human trafficking. Many players have attempted to use* *cryptocurrencies to fund their malignant behavior**. This is indeed a national security issue.”* 

According to Chainalysis, the total value of cryptocurrency laundered by year are pale compared to fiat. In 2021, it was $8.6B. You may want to know how much money was laundered during that year (both fiat and crypto) - between $800B and $2T. The upper estimate is more than twice larger than the global market capitalization of the whole crypto market now!

According to a Messari report, data from Chainalysis and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime revealed that traditional fiat money is used 800 times more than bitcoin to launder money on the darknet.

Don’t get me wrong, we could keep dropping, but scared money does not make money.

If you have the ability to do so, this is as good of an opportunity as ever to accumulate at fire sale prices.  Yes, I could be wrong and we drop to 15k, but if you are even here to begin with you probably believe in the future of crypto and expect prices to be higher in the coming years."

10/3/23,The nature of Reddit as a system means post sentiment flips incredibly drastically in even one day of price action or bad/good news.,"Welcome to [r/CC](https://www.reddit.com/r/CC/), people are already gloating that they were right about the bear market. This is one day of price action,reactionary to specific pieces of news, and has little to no relationship with the overall financial market. People are pointing at fears of recession in the mid term as if it's responsible for a hyper leveraged single day flash crash, and when we're still like 30% up from our previous lows.

The silent majority just upvote their confirmation bias with little to no engagement, so the overall sentiment of the sub completely flips instantly. The top comments go from bullish to bearish or vice versa as the enormous wave of people with little to no fundamental understanding of anything being discussed click the upvote button based on one day's price action.

Today we had crypto bank collapse confirmation, NYAG proceedings against ETH, and punitive tax law suggestions from the Biden administration. None of these things are a big deal, NYAG isn't federal and is targeting a small exchange, silvergate was already dead and is largely priced in, and the tax laws are targeting wash trades (good riddance) and represent at max a 3% tax on profits above 1M. Plus the laws won't even fucking pass.

When the crypto price does crash it crashes hard due to liquidations, people use an incredible amount of leverage in crypto, this isn't a new phenomenon. We're not even talking that large a liquidation series relative to what we've seen in the past. It's all waaa waaa life is over here, or we're going to the moon it's your last opportunity to buy, every time there's a price swing.

None of this adds up to anything substantial for crypto in even the medium term, tick tock next block, none of us know where the market is moving and cannot predict shit. The only thing we can know is that we've faced much, much worse and didn't go lower than 15K at that time, and that we've recovered from 99% crashes in the past, so if it does go to hell who gives a fuck if you're not done stacking."
10/3/23,2024 halving + recession = ???,"Hey guys,

I’m wondering what you think will happen to BTC when the next halving hits in 2024. You know the drill: every four years, the block reward gets cut in half, making new coins harder to mine and more scarce. This usually pumps the price up like crazy .

But here's the problem: the world is heading towards a recession, maybe even a depression. Everything is messed up: inflation, debt, trade wars, you name it . A recession means less money for everyone: less spending, less investing, less jobs, less confidence.

So how will this affect the BTC halving? Will it be a safe haven that people flock to when fiat currencies lose value? Or will it be a risky asset that people dump when they need cash? Will more people use BTC as a way to pay or save? Or will they ignore it or even outlaw it because of regulations?

Let’s look at some history for clues:

* The first halving was on Nov. 28, 2012. The price went from $12 to $1,207 in a year. The world was recovering from the Great Recession of 2008-2009.
* The second halving was on July 9 ,2016. The price went from $650 to $19 ,783 in 18 months. The world was growing moderately and had low inflation.
* The third halving was on May 11 ,2020. The price went from $8 ,566 to $64 ,863 in 11 months. The world was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath.

What do you think will happen in 2024? Let me know your predictions and opinions below."
10/3/23,"The entire Government machinery is behind destroying Crypto- that's not surprising, just disappointing.","I don't see that as much these days but the early days of Crypto (early 2010s) were filled with a lot of hatred for Government/ Centralization/ Intermediaries. The Cyber Punk was real and the sense of rebel against all these centralized authorities were very high. It felt the biggest purpose behind crypto was decentralization of power and enabling peer to peer transactions/ interactions without a centralized body. Much of that feels gone now.

Point being, the hatred for Government/ Centralized bodies came across so strong in early days of Crypto that a lot of people said if Crypto ever become anything remotely meaningful, Government will not take a second to kill it. It feels like 10 years after, that narrative has come to life and playing on its full strength. 

In the last 24-48 hours, we heard about new taxes on Bitcoin mining, possibly declaring Ethereum security, and shit-show with Crypto banks and more and more push for random senseless regulations. Some congressman has asked for stronger regulations, some are pushing for CBDC and so on. Gary uncle from SEC tweeted today that all he is doing is for protecting citizen/ investors and he thrashed Crypto entrepreneurs and their marketing on transparency...

All of this is expected but I do expect a lot more turbulence and wide swings. Hope the senses finally prevail and we see simplified sensible crypto world. Meanwhile, I am concerned."
10/3/23,Algorand community near-unanimously disapproves of a potential last-minute governance proposal for a 50M ALGO recovery fund to help offset myAlgo victims,"Due to the massive losses caused by an exploit of the myAlgo wallet, Algorand Venture Capital firm Borderless Capital [proposed a 50M ALGO recovery fund](https://twitter.com/borderless_cap/status/1633911425822236676) to mitigate the impact for the victims on Twitter:

>As a member of the Algorand Foundation Governance Advisory Committee, we would like to propose the creation of a **50M $ALGO Recovery Fund** ...  
>  
>...we suggest it should be included as a **3rd measure to be voted on before the end of the current governance period** of Q1 2023.

The Algorand community was split between those who wanted to create the fund and those who didn't want it. But nearly every agreed that changing governance in the middle of a period was unprecedented and a terrible idea:

Most were concerned that it was rushed and set a bad precedent:

And even if they did send funds to victim's wallets, their wallets would just get drained again.

I for one am glad the community is being rational about this proposal and shooting it down. The exploit was horrible, but we should not use governance to rush into solutions that make things worse."

Since the crypto crash in July, using BTC as a starting point, SafeMoon has shed -68% of its relative value to BTC, and performed even worse than ETH and BNB. It seems that the price of Safemoon seems entirely held up at the moment by BNB’s over performance in the market, as Safemoon’s main trading pair is SFM:BNB.  

The real comedy factor here are that Moons are performing far better than Safemoon, relatively to BTC they’re doing over 300% better!!  

And as Moons are also doing better than most of the established coins, I guess Moons were the real “Safe” moons all along 😉"
9/3/23,"What is ""Operation Choke-Point 2.0"" ?","**There is a new term being used to describe the seemingly coordinated efforts by regulatory authorities to stifle the growth of crypto, called ""*****Operation Choke Point 2.0*****""**

Why *2.0*, you may ask.. 

Operation Choke Point 1.0 was an initiative of the US Department of Justice. It began in 2013, and investigated banks, and the business they did with various parties involved in what you could consider ""fringe"", or morally questionable lines of business, or who were thought higher risk for fraud or money laundering. 

Here are some of the business sectors that the original Operation Choke Point aimed to scrutinize/restrict: 

https://preview.redd.it/11e86xrhlsma1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3a68d3741ed6a7d606121d817735988f2201592e

Ultimately, Operation Choke Point was heavily ridiculed, and was ultimately seen to unfairly restrict legitimate businesses operating within these spaces. Later, in 2015 - the FDIC issued a statement:  

*""The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued a Financial Institution Letter today encouraging supervised institutions to take a* ***risk-based approach in assessing individual customer relationships****, rather than* ***declining to provide banking services to entire categories*** *of customers without regard to the risks presented by an individual customer or the financial institution's ability to manage the risk.* 

The current happenings in crypto regulation were recently compared to the original *Operation Choke Point,* in an article written by Nic Carter, which can be found here: 

[https://www.piratewires.com/p/crypto-choke-point](https://www.piratewires.com/p/crypto-choke-point)

In this article, he lists a sequence of events that happened recently, which when read in sequence, do make this seem like a coordinated effort to unfairly ""choke"" a growing industry from the broken and corrupt banking system. 

**Here are some of the recent events that are noted in the article:**

Recently, higher profile influencers in the space have started talking about this as well. Guy from Coin Bureau (one of the few realistic YouTubers) released a video talking about this a few weeks ago: 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tV1jp4FrKlU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tV1jp4FrKlU)

I am unsure if any of this is indeed coordinated, or how much impact the average investor will feel. 

Regardless, it is interesting how authorities move in such unison ways, as if they don't think the layman's will notice. It does seem like the crypto industry is facing some new challenges in terms of on/off ramps into fiat, but we have faced FUD many times before.

Personally, if I can get my money into crypto - I don't much care about getting it out, especially as the infrastructure develops around payments and every day transactions - and I can actually use it more."

An update about staking with Coinbase
Starting March 29, 2023, our terms and conditions for staking are changing.
Here’s what you need to know:
Your staked assets will continue earning rewards. If you want to continue staking, no action is required. Your staking rewards may actually increase.

You earn rewards from the protocol, not Coinbase. Coinbase acts only as a service provider connecting you, the validators, and the protocol. We pass along any rewards earned from staking, minus a transparent Coinbase fee. In rare cases, your staked assets may be lost due to network penalties or other errors. Learn more

ATOM, SOL, ADA, and XTZ must be unstaked before you sell or send them. This could take a few hours or a few weeks, depending on the asset. The time required is due to protocol rules and Coinbase’s processing time.
If you want to opt out of these changes, unstake your assets on or before March 21, 2023. Keep in mind if you unstake, you’ll no longer earn staking rewards. Unstake to opt out"

The entire financial system is a joke, no different than the financial ""box""  SBF created to raise capital on FTT. 

The need for decentralized financial systems was born out of the ponzi scheme that was the 2008 banking system, and it will continue to show its prevalence through this storm.

Recently people have been posting repeated articles about bitcoin testing $20K and crypto, in general, going to the ground articles. 

To me, there is lots of noise and if you can't stomach the wild volatility of the crypto market then stay the hell away.

**1)** The current crypto U-turn is completely in-line with previous cycles. Please zoom out and take a look again its nothing out of normal.

https://preview.redd.it/viwnlbfn0zma1.png?width=844&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0010485ed08e39cc578e281b0cee8ff88646916d

**2)** A successful shift to a proof-of-stake by Ethereum is a great example for all the politicians and eco-friendly maximalists that crypto can pivot without losing its core value. 

**3)** BlackRock is the world's most valued fund-managing company. Blackrock invested $400 Million in Circle (a stablecoin issuer) and just that Blackrock is also the primary asset manager of USDC cash reserves. All in all, it's rock solid. ([Source](https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/12/blackrock-fidelity-and-others-to-invest-400m-in-usdc-stablecoin-issuer-circle/))

**4)** Regulations, I know you called me bitch, please hear me out. Crypto was not taken seriously in 2010 because it has no effect on the financial world and the overall market cap was very low less than a billion. But now you can't ignore crypto. Gov. can hate it or love it but crypto is going to stay. 

Let's put it out We don't like regulations in general, but it was coming. It is a double-edged sword and we will see if we get cut or not.

It is a much more favorable environment for an asset whose supply is finite and that has a long duration in essence, as its main attraction is its future potential rather than its current status. 

So relax DCA if you can and continue with your life, you will see bulls running once again very soon."

I've learnt my lesson from the end of the last bull market where I had to liquidat a lot I did not want, because I borrowed against my inflated collateral and used my loan for living expenses. So dumb.

Today i keep my Aave health factor over 3, which might be over cautious, but now that we are under 20k BTC - I sleep as well as I did before. Dunncare. Matter of fact, I profit from it!

Because I restrained myself from overborrowing at higher    overall crypto prices, I can borrow a tad now and add to my collateral. Mater of fact, since this mess began my APY went from 0.3 to 0.7 on Aave. I earn, even considering my borrowed money.

What makes me crazy in days like this is the FUD.

I understand mass medias which just make clickbait titles (in the best case) or highlight how many people have been victims of scams and bankrupted because of crypto exposure. They are pointing to uneducated people, making the interests of the big players (regulators).

There are then the so proclaimed specialized crypto blogs, pseudo-journals and so on which, instead of spreading pure information, educate people about cryptos, new projects, etc., just follow the mood of the day, like traditional media do with traditional finance.

""Powell declaration causes drop in Dow Jones by 2%"" literally becomes ""Powell declarations cause a drop in 10% for cryptos.""

Useless information, in both cases. Same garbage. Analysis of prices which has no content, no real analysis, just vomiting numbers with reference to resistance, support trendline randomly.

Then there are the worse ones. Bloggers of success, with many followers on Twitter. One of this today written an article called ""The possible but remote apocalypse of  Cryptocurrencies"".

A very neutral article about consequences of Gary Gensler declaration of securities and altcoins. A very superficial analysis of the consequences which may occur if Gensler words become reality.

The timing is what makes me really crazy. Normally I tolerate the presence of this articles in my feed, I know the contents and I just scroll down until they disappear.
This guy spent almost a week to do an analysis which even a 11 years old child can do. Or it has been purposly posted the same day of the dump? Nobody will never be sure of the answer. Bit everybody with a minimum of logical thinking can give his own answer to this question. 

I've started my personal war against these people. They are like scammers and traditional medias, trying to manipulate people for their likes. Or for a click in their article, so they can get some advert gain.

Avoid them. Let them vanish into oblivion.

In this article, an analysis by YouTuber and crypto investigator Coffeezilla revealed that Sun secretly minted 94% of allegedly decentralized stablecoin USDD, then advertised an alarming “392% to 584%” APY staking program on Sun.io. His Huobi exchange token also tanked by 93% in minutes today before Sun said he was putting 100 million USDD to provide liquidity blaming a few leveraged positions causing the crash. 93%?? 

CZ being connected to Sun either as a business partner or as a friend is a terrible sign. Get your crypto off now and into a cold wallet. If you are letting your coins sit on Binance then don’t cry to this sub afterwards when you lose them. And if you own any Tron you must hate money.

10/3/23,"""When there's a recession, a drop in profitability for everyone, that washes out the frauds. We haven't been doing this for the last three decades."" Bitcoin advocate Andreas Antonopoulos on the JRE show eerily predicted the macro-economic risks we're facing today and why cryptocurrency works","Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJrVeeD1zLs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJrVeeD1zLs)

There's no doubt, if you're a crypto enthusiast you need to give a listen to Andreas' talks. A lot of people link the video of him explaining Bitcoin to an empty conference room in 2013 but he's done a lot more. One I think everyone should listen to is any of his episodes on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast (He's appeared on there 3 separate times actually). Reminding yourself of the fundamentals of crypto can help keep you focused, at least it has for me.

&#x200B;

Here's just a couple quotes he's said:

\--------------

""What we've seen again and again, throughout history in the area of finance is that when there's a recession, when there's a drop in income and profitability for everyone, that event is actually really good for capitalism. What it does is it washes out the frauds, washes out the failures and unprofitable businesses. It's a great cleansing event.""

""All those companies that were simply reinvesting the recent gains to pay the people who were withdrawing their money, suddenly they can't do that anymore, they're washed out. Bad performing businesses, all of these things. We haven't been doing this, in this country for the last three decades. **Instead, what happens is that every time there's a recession the FED steps in and basically pumps water to raise the tide again. That means a lot of the crooks get to float from recession to recession without getting revealed. Worse, it encourages that kind of behavior. You need a cleansing event to wash out the fraud.**""

""The thing that I find positive and interesting around Bitcoin is that it serves a global society. It is truly global transnational money. It really is quite an incredible concept to be able to have this money that can operate on a global basis. To buy and trade and invest and borrow internationally.""

\--------------

Andreas - **""People are uncomfortable with Bitcoin because it represents changing one of the fundamental ancient technologies of civilization, money. We've only changed that technology four to five times in the history of human civilization. We've gone from barebones barter systems, systems of precious metals and other nice objects, certificates of deposit for precious metals, and then plastic. Traveler's checks and the first credit cards. And if you think any of these transitions were smooth, none of them were smooth. You go to someone who's been using precious metals for ten generations and say \[Hey, this is piece of paper is money now\], they'll say \[No, give me my gold that I can bite, that's money\]""**

Joe - ""How long is that transition?""

Andreas - ""400 years. Until broad acceptance of paper money. 400 years with huge resistance. It took almost 40 years for credit cards to go mainstream. With Bitcoin it'll probably do it within less than 20.""

Joe - ""You think so? It's been almost 10"" (At the time of the interview it was)

Andreas - ""It's been about 7, and it's accelerating. I think you're going to see either Bitcoin or a cryptocurrency very similar or based on Bitcoin be used as a national currency. We're not looking to displace national currencies, we're looking to supplement them."""
9/3/23,Banks going under could be bullish,"This is just me providing my hot take but interested to hear if anyone has a similar perspective.

It was pretty sad to see Silvergate go under. On the surface i dont think they did anything particularly shady (not more than any other bank), just a combination of being less liquid from bonds/MBS as well as the crypto market reeling. This now concentrates the fiat rails into Signature Bank so fingers crossed. 

Seeing Silicon Valley Bank as the broader banking sector today though it seems like there’s a significant stress test taking place in traditional finance right now. Just some stats: 

-$SVB is a top 20 bank and is -60% on the day. Get a load of this shitcoin!

-Today is the worst day for bank stocks in 3 years with the top 4 losing $47 billion.

There’s probably alot of banks swimming naked but dont have their assets fully marked-to-market. The increased cost of deposits, long duration securities to generate yield, and straight up fear with bank runs popping up everywhere means that there could be more -60%s coming. Youve got all these held-to-maturity securities in deep deep unrealized losses.

**This could be bullish** on the subject of a pivot. Alot of people said the Fed won’t pivot until something breaks, well what we are seeing is some serious bend across the institutions that uphold this grand charade. Big red numbers flashing on the screens of their money makers could just rattle the Fed and take 50bps on the table.

Its not impossible, the Fed has slowed rate hikes earlier than expected in 2019 to “assess economic conditions” and after that a 17% rally ensued over the next few months. 

Crypto banks going under fuels their narrative, but traditional banks going under is where their concern is.

**Edit**: just checked Fed Futures and 50bps probability has gone down 15% today on the $SVB news

**Edit 2**: too many people focusing on the title and not reading my post. Looking for insight into what I actually wrote about"
10/3/23,25bps is back on the table thanks to a shot in the foot from the banking system,"I made a post last night about the potential ramifications of a distressed banking sector could mean in terms of the Fed’s approach to monetary policy and it actually may be playing out here.

This is the 2nd day of dysfunction in the banking industry. SVB is trying to make a sale, trading of some banks has been short-restricted or even straight up halted. Regional banks are taking a beating as they’re significantly less capitalized than these big banks and cant offload their held-to-maturity bonds and securities to satisfy withdrawals. The Fed shrinking their balance sheets and crushing reserves is outpacing liquidity of small banks.

As of 2 days ago, 50bps rate hike was a 75% probability and now it has completely swung 75% in favour of **25bps** which is crazy to do in a matter of a couple days. Not only that but theres actually some buildup in the sentiment that the Fed will *cut* rates by 25bps in December of this year.

The market seems to think that the bending of small-mid sized banks is going to be what makes the Fed blink. I seriously hope they dont wait until after something breaks, we’re pretty high on the fuck around/find out scale already"
10/3/23,It took me over 12 hours last night to buy my crypto.,"I bought some ETH through trustwallet yesterday and it took 12 hours to get to me long story short.

I do not recommend using mercuryio as a middle man as they are the slowest people possible with horrible customer service. The only reason I used them is because trust wallet had them recommended as the best price. So I went with it. I usually use moonpay but anywho 

I normally do not use trustwallet directly when it comes to buying crypto. Hate me all you want but I prefer to use Coinbase , and then unload it off to my trust wallet.

This is not a CB shill but when it comes to buying crypto. CB is almost instant with your funds to crypto, because they are an exchange so it makes sense they can move coins around quickly because of their “reserves.” So normally I buy on CB transfer to trust. Simple process for low fee tokens. 

The only crypto I buy directly to trust is ETH because of ETH fees obviously. 

I load up $250 as my purchase price. Something simple for a Thursday, and set my order. Boom transaction is complete 3:10 pm.

I receive an email instantly thanking me for my purchase and saying please wait 2-4 hours for your purchase.

So I’m already pissed because 2-4 hours in the crypto world is a whole bull run sometimes. And I’m just waiting for a transaction that should take minutes.

Fast forward 5 hours later. I am emailing mercury asking where my crypto is. I get a response back from a woman named Katherine who tells me due to high network load please be patient and wait.

So I ended up waiting 12 hours yesterday for $250 of crypto.

We will never have mass adoption at this rate."

10/3/23,[SERIOUS] Life lessons from crypto,"I realised that I have learnt a good number of lessons from crypto that have shaped my investment philosophy in non-crypto assets, as well as my approach to life in general. 



My most valued lesson is patience. I have learnt that patience can really be the difference between success and failure. Sometimes all it takes is a little bit of patience to see the profits you've so much desired. Similarly, lack of patience has resulted in terrible losses for some people. 



Secondly, I have learnt that you should never look down on anyone/anything. Like how some coins pump when no one thought they would go anywhere. There's an important lesson to be learnt there.



This next lesson might seem contradictory to the two above, but if you read between the lines you'll see the difference. The lesson is that sometimes it's just not worth it to keep holding on, no matter your faith in something or someone. Think about those crypto projects that you really believed in, did your absolute research, went all in, then they went to zero. Learn to let go. 



If you cherish it, you'll protect it. I mean... ""not your keys, not your crypto"" is our daily mantra. I learnt that if it's something that means a lot to you, you'll do all you can to keep it safe. Like how we talk of getting a hardware wallet, or moving your crypto off the CEX. It's the same way you'dvstrive to make sure your other valuables are safe.



It's okay to take risks. If it goes well, you win big. If it goes south, you learn a lesson. There's no failure, only lessons. It's like putting a small portion of your money into a memecoin or some random NFT project. If you don't take risks, you're NGMI. And if you don't manage your risk, you're DEFINITELY NGMI in this lifetime and many lifetimes to come.



Learning how to research is one of the most important skills that crypto has taught most of us. Make sure you know everything there is to know about someone/something before you get involved. And don't just research, but use the information to make an informed decision. Always DYOR, they say. Don't trust, verify. 



Next lesson: Knowledge is power! The more you know, the safer you'll be. Learn how things work in this life and life will be a smooth ride for you. Some people have lost money to scammers simply because they didn't know better. For example, that investment that says it will pay you 98% profits every day, is a scam. And that beautiful girl in your DM is not the CEO of Metamask.



I used to have feelings until I got into crypto. Now I don't feel anything lol. The lesson has been to be less emotional, more factual. Switch off your emotions when it's time to make a decision. Forget about whether you feel happy, sad, or excited about something. See it for what it is. The emotional trader will get liquidated. 



Ladtly, never stop learning. Stay stupid, ask questions, read articles, watch YouTube videos. I found that the crypto space is constantly changing, with new concepts coming up everyday. The only way to stay on top of things is to keep learning."

10/3/23,"Silvergate Story Is About Fundamentals, Not Just Crypto","(Via [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/silvergates-story-is-about-fundamentals-not-just-crypto-30f08fc6) \-- [non-paywall link here](https://archive.is/mfmai))

**The lender’s problems stemmed partly from age-old banking risks such as concentration and matching assets and liabilities**

Silvergate Capital  was in the newfangled business of cryptocurrency banking. But it  ran into some very old banking problems—which could rattle investors in  traditional lenders, too.

The California bank said Wednesday that it intends to wind down and plans to return all deposits. Though Silvergate’s customers were once cryptocurrency exchanges  such as Coinbase Global and FTX, its core banking activity was actually  quite familiar: holding deposits of ordinary dollars from those  customers and investing in government-backed securities. And therein  lies the concerning part for bank investors.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/usxpt95j9tma1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f58c7716435a4cc70018552dc19e521e1d23fbd6

Unlike some bank failures of recent memory, Silvergate didn’t  have bad assets in the sense of risky loans or complex derivatives. In  fact, its assets were mostly unassailable things like U.S. Treasurys and  agency mortgage-backed securities. But credit risk—or the risk of not  being paid back—isn’t the only kind of risk banks face. Securities such  as these carry interest-rate risk.

So **when rates surged as the Federal Reserve hiked in 2022,  Treasurys and mortgage bonds plunged in price**. Now if a bank is able to hold on to these securities until they mature,  it doesn’t ultimately lose anything. **The problem comes if a bank needs  to sell them before maturity, crystallizing the losses in their market  value. Silvergate has said it had to sell securities amid its deposit outflows**.

Banks can plan for this risk by aiming to match the duration of  their liabilities, which includes deposits, to their assets. For  example, if a bank is getting funding via a one-year certificate of  deposit, it can buy a Treasury maturing in one year to match. But if a  bank’s deposits can move at any moment, it has to weigh that risk when  investing.

A bank could just keep all its money in cash. But to earn more,  banks need to take more risk. They can manage this by building up a mix  of deposits that don’t all move or reprice at once. This is done by  diversifying across customer and account types, or by adding term  deposits such as CDs. Banks also diversify with assets that are floating  rate, like many kinds of corporate loans or credit card loans.

So most banks aren’t subject to risks of a single industry such  as crypto. Having so much of its funding coming from similar types of  depositors turned out to be one of Silvergate’s biggest risks. But there  are still echoes across banking. For one, the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corp. reports that banks had unrealized losses on securities of about $620 billion as of the fourth quarter. Plus, banks’ deposits are starting to move more quickly,  and against the backdrop of the Fed’s aggressive rate increases and the  unusual postpandemic economy, it isn’t clear exactly what their  ultimate velocity will be. Notably, valuable deposits on which banks don’t pay any interest have been declining.

Banks generally have a number of sources of liquidity and have  diversified over time. Few are at risk of needing to wind down so  quickly. But many may still have to take actions  throttling back on  loan growth or raising more capital if the Fed keeps going and deposits  flee more quickly than anticipated.

Silvergate may have been an unusual bank. But its story carries old lessons that all investors sometimes need to relearn."

10/3/23,Is it worth declaring cryptotax if you've made a big loss?,"I'm in a bit of a pickle at the moment and would like some advice.

&#x200B;

I invested in crypto (mainly cardano) very early on and turned roughly 5-10k into 150k. I didn't touch this until the 2021 tax year, where I started moving it around into other coins + traded nfts. During this time, I saw my total holdings creeped down further and further as crypto plummeted until I eventually withdrew what I had left and said fuck it I'm out. I ended up leaving with roughly 15k-20K.

So there's a few things to note here:

While I was moving coins around, I first triggered a capital gains event on my cardano holdings, which was around 100k in gains, but also would have the 50% CGT discount, as I held it for longer than 12 months. But then I continued to swap coins around as the value of crypto plummeted 80% give or take, meaning that I would have triggered a capital loss of 80k or so.

Here's the problem:

Because I invested in so many shitcoins and defi projects, as well as using heaps of different wallets and exchanges, the data on my tax tracking software is completely fucked up and is showing a total gain of 200k. I have taken it to an accountant and he has suggested I just change everything to a flat rate which is allowed by tax agencies, but I would still incur a big tax bill.

I know that I made a huge loss from crypto, and I haven't withdrawn anything more than 15-20k to my personal bank account in fiat. My crypto wallets are empty. Last tax year I paid the tax agency a 3k tax bill on gains and I refuse to give those assholes any more money, especially when I have genuinely made a huge loss. 

Given that I've only withdrawn 15-20k to my personal bank account and the data is completely fucked up/not all of it is trackable cos of the wallets/exchanges i've used. Do you guys think it could be safe to just call it quits here and not declare anything on tax going forward (related to crypto)? 

I appreciate any thoughts and advice."

10/3/23,Our time is here !,"Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a response to the 2008 financial crisis.

This could very well be the first time in bitcoin's history that it will experience what it was made to protect against.

SVB just got seized by FDIC. 151 Billion dollars potentially uninsured.

If banks start to fail because of underwater bonds, then it's not due to bankster money management practices like in 2008. Instead, it's a system risk in the financial sector. One that can affect commercial banks.

If the public doesn't feel safe putting their money in the bank, then there's only 3 things to do:

1. Cash out. Keep money under the pillow. This is exposed to high-inflation.

2. Convert to Gold. This is exposed to Gold's volatility and difficult to self-custody.

3. Buy Bitcoin. This is easy to self-custody, but exposed to high volatility. But if Bitcoin starts to pump because of all this, then it can trigger FOMO / a sense of security.

If banks start falling left & right, and you see Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citi Bank, etc. exposed to this much unrealized loss, what will you do? BUY BTC !"

Yesterday (MAR 09, 2023), I published a short analysis on [**“Who is building in the crypto bear market?”**](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/11n2a1r/who_is_building_in_the_crypto_bear_market_top_20/) — ranking some projects by number of 'commits' in the protocol in the last three months.

The number of 'commits' by itself is a metric that has some important counterpoints and, therefore, should never be considered in isolation when analyzing solidity and the productive activity of open source projects.

Thinking about it, I decided to dive into the cryptocurrency ecosystem that I know best and stood out in the number of 'commits' in the period, in addition to presenting a great result in the **n#C/MCap** index — also explored in the previous report.

## Quick introduction about nano and some economic data

**Nano** (ticker: **XNO**), is a peer-to-peer decentralized coin whose genesis block was published in 2017 and all units were distributed through faucets.

Its protocol and network allow any server to connect through its own node and its users to carry out transactions without any fees and with irreversible confirmation, usually in less than a second — all this in a secure way.

#### Some economic data that can be considered in conjunction with the data that will be presented in this small report:

* **Current price:** $0.75
* **All-time high:** $37.62 (JAN 02, 2018)
* **Historical low:** $0.006658 (MAR 10, 2017)
* **Circulating Supply:** 133,248,297 XNO
* **Total and Maximum Supply:** 133,248,297 XNO (0% new issues)
* **Current market cap:** $99,936,222.75 (#250)

## General data from nano-node

Next, we'll look at some data from the most popular repository in the **XNO** ecosystem: The [**nano-node**](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/).

* **Contributors:** 87
* **Releases:** 106
* **Stars:** 3,400
* **Forks:** 793
* **Created on:** 04/27/2014
* **Top contributor:** clemahieu (2,752 commits)

### Number of commits in 3, 6, 9 and 12 months

Let's look again at the updated data from the [CryptoMiso.com](https://www.cryptomiso.com/) website used in the last analysis.

* **03 months:** 167 commits (average of 55.66/month)
* **06 months:** 213 commits (average of 35.5/month)
* **09 months:** 336 commits (average of 37.33/month)
* **12 months:** 419 commits (average of 34.91/month)

Within those 12 months, a total of 18 different contributors contributed to the roughly 419 commits — according to [GitHub contributor data](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/graphs/contributors?from=2022-03-07&to=2023-03-10&type=c).

### Code frequency

Historical frequency of activity and code in the nano-node indicates a consolidation of activity at the current moment, with greater solidification of the code in relation to its beginning.

## Rank: ‘Best-of-Crypto’ — by LukasMasuch

Developer [LukasMasuch created the ](https://github.com/LukasMasuch/best-of-crypto)[**'Best-of-Crypto'**](https://github.com/LukasMasuch/best-of-crypto), described as:

*🏆 A ranked list of awesome open-source crypto projects. Updated weekly.*

And nano also stands out, ranking among the best open source projects — even with its current low market capitalization.

https://preview.redd.it/ajmo8wjvtyma1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=edb35fc0e1e619b3e4f2b827fbb533951cfa841f

We see XNO with a score of 29, taking the #06 position among peer-to-peer decentralized cryptocurrencies.

## Rank: Social Engagement — by NanoLooker

Nano's block explorer site, [**NanoLooker**](https://nanolooker.com/social), also has its own ranking, by dividing the number of GitHub stars for every $1 billion of market capitalization.

Nano takes the first position, with a clear advantage among the other projects.

## A look at the ecosystem — by nano.casa

Last but not least. The [**nano.casa**](https://nano.casa/), by [George Mamar](https://twitter.com/geommr), monitors activity, not just in the main nano protocol repositories, but the entire decentralized and open source ecosystem that revolves around this cryptocurrency.

The platform currently monitors:

* **Total contributors:** 492
* **Total repos:** 319

https://preview.redd.it/pvq3y9kztyma1.png?width=2266&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f80c14f0f8fe9acd238f7583fe21cf58899f4e5f

And the weekly activity chart demonstrates constancy of development over the years since 2017 — even with the significant loss in capitalization and price over the same period.

## Conclusion

It is remarkable that **nano** (XNO) manages to demonstrate a great level of work, development and build of a living, decentralized and collaborative ecosystem in the open source scenario.

This is one of the many factors that have fueled my interest in this project for a few years to now.

I believe that, by being able to demonstrate these characteristics, even in unfavorable conditions (with a loss of price and capitalization that generates disincentives for contributors), **XNO** still promises to grow a lot in the coming years, if it manages to attract the attention of investors and funding.

And its high activity and decentralization, contrasted with a low capitalization ranking — both compared to other projects — may indicate a current good investment opportunity. Which would make the previous paragraph possible.

**Generating a continuous cycle of improvement.**

10/3/23,"Stop being delusional, stop being double-faced","Hello community, I'm in this crypto-circus before the 2017 run and literally the same things happen over and over again. Why is this market full of people who pretend to care about tech, but their brain is just thinking of the profits? 

Be wise, contribute if you have knowledge, remain silent if you are only after the ROI anyway, you cause more damage than you might think.


Be honest to yourself, only because you invested your live savings in this or that coin, it doesn't mean you have to shill it anywhere in the internet.

If you all continue like this, all crypto coins will end up like BitConnect, and then say farewell to your life savings forever.

EDIT:   Think about why you entered the cryptomarket in the first place!
With cryptos we are independent from central banks, and we could even pay each other in crypto, not in FIAT.

10/3/23,Thoughts After Rewatching Grayscale's CEO on CNBC,"Yesterday Michael Sonnenshein was on CNBC discussing a few topics that the company is engaged in and the reaction from the CNBC hosts was interesting, to say the least. He covered many different topics that have recently been affecting the company and more importantly been capturing headlines across the investment space. 

&#x200B;

When he first came on he was discussing Grayscale's current lawsuit against the SEC over its consistent denial of a Bitcoin Spot ETF and said that in their recent appeals court hearing that he was pretty optimistic about how it went. He credited the team of lawyers that Grayscale has assembled over the years as really being able to relay and poke holes in the SEC's reasoning for the rejection. The key thing he stated was how the SEC was allowing a futures market but not a spot market ETF. Since these rely on the same things and are intertwined Grayscale is arguing that since they have approved multiple futures ETFs they now need to allow these spot ETFs. In Mr. Sonnenshein's opinion, it seems that the court was appearing to agrees with that reasoning. 

&#x200B;

What was covered next was the recent lawsuit brought against Grayscale by FTX debtors. This lawsuit is honestly not going to have any winners and brings up an issue that has been a thorn in Grayscale's side. Their high fees. FTX debtors have filed a lawsuit against Grayscale to finally force Grayscale to let FTX redeem their shares something that Grayscale has prevented a ton of people from being able to do but also against the fees that the company has already paid. Over the last two years with just FTX Grayscale has charged over $1.3 billion in management fees which the debtors are trying to recoup. Overall this lawsuit is seeking to unlock $9 billion or more in value for FTX.

&#x200B;

As I previously mentioned fees have been a recurring issue for Grayscale and while they have reduced them in the past they are still extremely high in today's market. For products like Grayscale offers fees are going to be much higher than say SPYD (the S&P 500 high dividend ETF) and examples like Kathy Woods Ark Investments show that people will invest still understanding it is a more risky asset. However, a 2% annual fee is something else especially when you cannot redeem your shares for Bitcoin. When this was highlighted Mr. Sonnenshein noted the extremely high cost that it takes to run the Trust and company, especially with the lawsuits and repeated filings that the company has to do which to a point I do understand but it is a double-edged sword. 

&#x200B;

Until the lawsuits die down I do not see that cost shrinking which means I am not sure that they will be able to lower fees all that much. Grayscale has assembled good lawyers but that also means that they are spending a buttload of money on that endeavor and with Digital Currency Group already having all the money issues they are lower fees from that angel would be a hard pill to swallow. When pressed about the fees Mr. Sonnenshein did not back down and defended the fee price further making me believe that the 2% fee is going to stick around unless something dramatically changes and quickly.

&#x200B;

Now I will be the first to say you are better off by far just owning Bitcoin outright compared to through something like Grayscale but at the same time that is not always possible for people. If Grayscale was able to allow redemptions of their Trust it would be a game-changer for Crypto because of how far it would launch Bitcoin as something with value. Fingers crossed with the court cases breaking in their favor and the SEC getting a nice butt kicking which I think we would all love to see happen to Gary Gensler if we are being honest with ourselves.  "
10/3/23,CoinStats App - Arbitrum Nova Portfolio Tracking Feature request,"Hey all,
In my last thread asking portfolio apps coinstats community manager kindly stopped and said that if enough coinstats users requested it, they would add ARB.Nova portfolio tracking.

This would mean you would be able to track your vaults tokens, like Moons. I like to track my P&L and since moons and nova has some cool stuff happening in the coming months be good to track it.

I imagine it would also be useful for people providing liquidity too.

So, if you guys want them to add nova tracking, make your voices heard.

10/3/23,If TokenX price will go below XXX.XX USD I'll definitely buy some more,"Hi all, I would like to have your opinions/strategies on something that I read a lot around, which is basically what is written in the title: for example ""if Bitcoin goes below 20k I'll buy more"". And this applies in general to any crypto for which people often set this ""buy threshold"". 

Of course, one can say ""If BTC goes back to 1USD, I'll buy a shitload"", but my question is more regarding how do you set your reasonable thresholds.
Is it based on TAs? For example you are quite convinced that a certain coin will hit a target price, so you buy at a fraction of that price because you want to achieve a certain x-times profit.

Or is It based on the history of your investment? For example, you originally bought BTC at 20k, so now whenever It goes below that, you consider It a good opportunity to buy as It is a more favorable condition with respect to the original investment.

Or is It neither of these and there are other factors at play?"
10/3/23,"Voyager Liquidates $56M in Ethereum, SHIB, and Other ERC-20 Tokens",
10/3/23,Next use case for moons?,"Whats the next use case for moons?

I think the easiest use case is a moons shop. Buy moons gear with your moons. Who doesnt want a moons shirt or hat? Mouse pad? Keyboard? Endless possabilities, and further increasing utility and use.

The banner burn has been great, moons.io definitely provided a bump to moons. Now the moons liquidity being the latest use. 

As we increase use we continue to move in the right direction. We all await the day that moons lists on a actual exchange. Moons can finally go to the moon!

Anyone got any other ideas where we can take moons?"
10/3/23,Analysis of the Role of Cryptocurrencies in Great Power Competition,"The market is experiencing a big drop again. Although there have been various scandals in the cryptocurrency circle recently, each with its own reasons, there is a common phenomenon that the more centralized an institution is, the more likely it is to have problems. For example, Silvergate Bank. This obvious mistake happens frequently in the cryptocurrency circle, but people always fail to learn from it. Ordinary people always like simple and fast money-making projects that do not require learning or energy. However, there is no free lunch in the world. In the context of major national confrontations, we must be cautious, or we will easily become cannon fodder, sacrificed for others.

&#x200B;

I think cryptocurrency is a tool that all governments in the world want to use for their own benefit. However, cryptocurrency is precisely the force that is least willing to yield. This force is a manifestation of the pursuit of personal power by ordinary people. The Chinese government may believe that cryptocurrency can undermine the absolute position of the US dollar, while the US government believes that cryptocurrency can guide ordinary people to form a force that undermines the Chinese government. Therefore, the situation is changing, and this force is always fluctuating, sometimes strong, sometimes weak, sometimes leaning towards one side, and sometimes towards the other. This force is difficult to control, but many governments want to control it. However, most of the time, they will find that the real cryptocurrency that is controlled is no longer cryptocurrency, as it has lost its most important essence, which is decentralization.

&#x200B;

As ordinary people, we should learn how to use the benefits brought by this competition. Although it is difficult, please remember that the essence of cryptocurrency is decentralization. Any attempt to centralize cryptocurrency will weaken its power. Therefore, it is crucial to stick to this point and not lose our direction."
10/3/23,Android Users: Use Desktop to See the Price of an r/ cc Special Membership,"I talked to a few people in r/cryptocurrencymoons yesterday, that were unaware of the lower fiat price of a special membership to r/cc. For some reason, when you look at the special membership section of the sub on some Android phones, it only gives you the option to pay with moons, which is right now a little pricey. 

However, if you use desktop and go to the sub, it will give you a choice between paying with moons or paying $4.99 USD per month (may vary based on location). When I subscribed, it used PayPal to process the payment. Personally, when I discovered the cheaper price, I jumped at the chance to join. I didn't want to spend my moons but $4.99 per month isn't too bad.

I hope this helps some people on Android who may not know of the cheaper price for a membership and maybe even bring in some new subscribers!"
10/3/23,Staked ETH Withdrawals Could Be Imminent,
10/3/23,"Since 2% of all wallets own 95% of Bitcoin, it's s price is likely manipulated in a way we don't pay attention to.","Bitcoin is often believed to be manipulated, with theories on how this occurs, and these cries often occur when the price starts tanking. Naturally. 

However, rarely or never do we hear about it being manipulated to maintain its position as the default ""standard"". By that I mean, it's price is satoshis being sole indicator of how altcoins are priced in USD. Those who control most of the bitcoin have a strong interest in keeping it this way.

Using Big Media and social influencers to boost this sentiment, this allows them to manipulate the altcoin market for profit.

###Altcoins can spark a bull run on Bitcoin.

One overlooked strategy is buying up a dozen or so cheap altcoins to create a bull run on alts leading to a bull run on bitcoin.  A bullrun on 10 alts outside of the top 10 going 3x over a short time excites people and leads to a bull run on Bitcoin and everything else. This is much cheaper than buying Bitcoin to spark a bull run on alts.  Like 90% cheaper, and can lead to billions of dollars in profit from the altcoin market. Once the altcoins peak, a coordinated FUD event along with s huge dump can create panic selling, allowing for a buyback of discounted Bitcoin.

95% of all Bitcoin is pretty much the entire market st your disposal.   Also many major institutions that bought billions in BTC are sister companies of one major company owned and controlled by a handful of people.   This includes banks.  The same bankers that ban you from using them to buy Bitcoin actually own Bitcoin themselves. 

Wow."

If you're convinced the government cares about the financial well being of dumb people, then maybe this explains why corruption is do rampant today.  Because people were led to believe ""what we are doing is a good thing"".

You really believe 7 figure salary suits care about your gambling habits?  You think they haven't figured out already that dumb gambling addicts are going to do dumb things with their money anyway? You know, like lose $10K during March madness, or placing bets with bookies they can't pay back? 

You think by them blocking access to many alt coins makes these regulators truly believe that's going to stop gamblers from finding a way to buy shitcoins?    They know the regulations aren't stopping this.

Also, why does the example of people needing to be protected always depict some sort of Innocent struggling person with high hopes losing all their money and ruining their life?     If someone struggling is desperate enough to risk all their money on crypto, they would find s way to risk all their money on something else if crypto didn't exist.


You also believe criminals will be prevented from using crypto to do illegal activities?  What type of criminals?  Criminals with millions of dollars already have a vast network of tools at their disposal to buy and trade any crypto they want.  Regulated, banned, restricted...none of them matter, and they will purchase whatever crypto they want, whatever guns they want.   They will do whatever it takes to accomplish big goals, and the more millions involved, the more serious they will get even if it means kidnapping politicians in foreign countries. 

So exactly what is a piece of paper doing to prevent someone from buying into a rugpull or getting themselves in a lot of trouble?

If all regulations for crypto drop right now, Is that going to make you a criminal? 

   Is that going to make people who don't gamble suddenly blow their life savings on crypto?

First of all, moons are worth something and reddit coins are not.

But let's just say the reddit coins have a monetary value...

You can convert moons to coins at a 2.5 ration. However, these coins can ONLY be used on this sub. Let's look at buying coins on reddit, which can be used to give awards anywhere. The best option, with the 63 percent bonus, is 200 dollars for 82000 coins. This shows that 1 dollar is equal to 410 coins. As of right now, moons are fluctuating between 20 cents and 25 cents. Let's just say that moons are 20 cents right now; this would mean that 5 moons should be able to get 410 coins, usable on all of reddit. However, if we put this into this sub's convert moons to coins function, we would only be able to get 12 coins lol (rounds down!), usable only for this sub.

Now let's look at the worst option for buying coins, or, 0 percent bonus. Aka the cheapest option. 2 dollars for 500 coins. This means that 1 dollar would get 250 coins. This means that 5 moons should be able to get 250 coins, usable everywhere. However, again, this only gets us 12 coins through the conversion.

Let's say that each moon was worth 1 cent (hopefully never happens lol). In that case, it would be the equivalent of just buying 500 coins for 2 dollars. However, the coins are still restricted to just this sub, so STILL not worth it.

I doubt anyone here has ever even considered swapping moons for coins, and I probably wouldn't do it if coins don't have a use other than giving awards, even if 1 moon could be swapped for ten thousand coins. I'm just pointing out that this is an extraordinarily outdated system that really needs to be removed or modified, since at this point it's just a joke."

**CENTRE CONSORTIUM (CCL)**

Founded in 2018, CCL is a Coinbase & Circle combined venture. Their site states *their mission is to provide the governance standards for the future digital financial ecosystem.*

You can draw all sorts of conclusions from that. I dug deeper into the site and the company. It was at hubspot that I found what I was looking for.

**BLACKLIST POLICY**

Your USDC can be remotely frozen.

The policy language goes on to state that you can be blacklisted without notice for any of the following reasons:

* comply with a law
* regulation
* US court order
* a duly recognized US authorized authority
* majority vote of its Board of Managers

I understand the motive, but this language is deliberately vague & ambiguous.  Over time, it will invariably trap users it wasn't designed to go after.

10/3/23,[Serious] OmiseGo: Is this coin dead?,"Hi /r/CC,

I have a few questions about this coin. I cannot find any conclusive information about this coin. What I do find, tells me that the coin is dead and it was taken over by another network. With that said, if you are in the know, can you please answer any or all of these questions:

1. Is OmiseGo (OMG) dead? I ask this question because the Omise Go network website is gone. It doesn't even load.

2. From my research, it seems to have been ""sold"" to a new network called Baba. Google reveals this: ""The OMG Network as such does not exist anymore — instead, Boba Network inherited the OMG Network community."" What does this even mean?

3. If the coin is dead, why is it still being traded on many exchanges?

4. What is even being traded on these exchanges? If the coin is dead, the network offline, how is anything Omisego even being traded?

Edit: I appreciate everyone's response. My questions were answered."

The ""March Festival"" event started yesterday and features game maps from:

* Gordon Ramsay's Hell's Kitchen
* Raving Rabbids
* French Weeks
* MadBalls

The Rabbids maps are already available on the [play map](https://www.sandbox.game/en/season/) while the rest will be gradually added later this month.

Just like with the February Festival event, events games are all free to play (with a few exceptions). I quite liked many of the February maps.

How it works is that Everyone who completes 300 points of quests this month and meets the KYC requirements is guaranteed to win a prize. Most of them (60%) will win packages of SAND, 40% will get a crappy Magic Love Wand, and 0.1% of really lucky winners will get a special paid avatar or Premium LAND (worth $4K+). An additional 350K SAND will be available for LAND and Avatar holders.

New prizes should be on the Polygon blockchain going forward instead of the Ethereum blockchain, so minting fees should be cheap. That was one of the biggest complaints in previous rounds. Rewards are typically given a month later to everyone who qualifies by completing the point requirements.

10/3/23,Appeal - be responsible to yourself.,"A lot of people here bought cryptocurrencies because they wanted to flip them. 

Every fanatic and crypto-bro are people who are nothing but scammers who have been scammed first.

They bought some crap and now they shill it for others to buy the same thing to increase the value to get rid of it when it happens.

I own some crypto, alt coins, bought long time ago. I hodL, ffs. Just in case, I don't really know why. But I don't expect any of that to go up again. Honestly, I'll keep it for a year or whatever, we'll see what is going to happen. If by some miracle it bounces back to the amount I invested plus 5%, I will sell it.

I think that NFTs, meme coins and scams like FTX destroyed a beautiful ideology. But that's all it was. Ideology. Because of the stupidity of it all. And we let it. 

In the last year, every time crypto or NFT is mentioned both on the internet and in real life, people get sick of life and everyone cringes.

99% of people hate crypto because of it. All scams revolve around that and meme coins.

I have a couple of questions for you: Why is that? Where is the promised decentralization and where is the example that it is feasible? Where are the cool projects? Do any popular games use crypto in their environment and which ones?

And most importantly - why do you attack people when they ask concrete questions and not creators, developers, validators and others who promote NFTs and cryptocurrencies that you hold and are worth nothing to you? Why do people here feel the need to defend it as if it were some sick religion? I hope you all understand that this is a business that is closely related to criminal activities based on greed?

This is not FUD, btw. I really like underlying tech and initial idea behind it all.

This is just an invitation to think about where we went wrong, because I'm sick of seeing so many fake projects, invented fake meme coins and projects? 

Invest in what you want. Don't force others into that story. Don't defend failed projects.

I still believe that this crypto market will recover, but please, ordinary people like me, think about who you are giving money to and for what. If you throw money at stupidity, they will sell it to us more.

Honestly, I feel sorry for the people who lost a lot more than I did.

I'm down maybe $100. That's nothing compared to the majority here.

We need to be real here and ditch those things that gave crypto and blockchain technology a bad name.

That's all.

10/3/23,Friendly Reminder: The Importance of Market Cycles in Investing: What Every Crypto Investor Needs to Know,"As we have already experienced, crypto can be a wild roller coaster of emotions and price changes which can make us fall in the trap of hype and take emotional decisions based on short term movements. Learning about markey cycles can help to mitigate mistakes.

# Market Cycles 🎢

In simple words, market cycles are the natural up and down of prices in a given market. This means that there are times when prices are high and times when they are low, and these cycles tend to repeat themselves over time.

**Market cycles are divided into four different phases:**

1. **Expansion/Accumulation:** This phase happens because of economic growth and it leads to a bull market because investors want to buy. It use to last years if the economy is well managed.
2. **Peak/Markup:** This is the moment when buying pressure reaches its highest point and marks the transition to the next step, the contraction stage where investors do not want to buy at this high prices.
3. **Contraction/Distribution:** The distribution phase means the weakening of the market. It starts at a peak and ends at the trough. This is the period called a market recession.
4. **Trough/Markdown:** At this moment, the market has already reached its lowest possible point and starts again to move to the expansion phase.

[Market Cycles](https://preview.redd.it/8nwllj8jsxma1.png?width=748&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e5bd34018d19c40ee9518772708be1d97cd2ef9b)

# Why is this important?

It is important because understanding market cycles can help you make better investment decisions. With this knowledge, you can detect when a new market cycle has begun before others and make decisions accordingly. For example, you can accumulate fiat until the accumulation phase is starting to end.

Understanding market cycles can also help you avoid panic selling during dumps. If you know that prices tend to go up and down in cycles, you may be less likely to panic when the market takes a dip and hold and wait for the cycle to turn things up.

I know that predicting the market is almost impossible, but there are some factors that you can identify faster by paying attention to market trends and historical data and take advantage from it.

# Conclusion

Understanding market cycles is a key part of investing in cryptocurrency and stocks. Using that knowledge, you can make better buying and selling decisions, and avoid getting caught by emotions triggered by short term movements. This is why I recommend taking a step back and consider the bigger picture of market cycles before investing.

Market always provides new opportunities.

I have to add this picture about market sentiment cycles because without it, this is not a good post on market cycles.

10/3/23,Random tax question: Can I delete $0 sales from my 1099-B? (Mostly sales of staking rewards or from transaction fees that have <$0.01 value.)," I tried posting this on [r/tax](https://www.reddit.com/r/tax/) and didn't get any replies, so I thought maybe someone here might know.

I'm using TurboTax and imported all my crypto transactions from 2022 via CoinTracker, which auto generated a 1099-B listing every single transaction.

I guess because I earned weekly ""Staking"" rewards through exchanges like Coinbase, I have small transactions for fractions of tokens being received for $0. Just as a hypothetical, let's say I bought 999.95 XLM tokens (a pretty cheap coin) and staked them... each week I might have received 0.005 XLM's as a ""reward,"" but each of those distributions have a $0 value because they're practically worthless.

When I sold/disposed of some of these holdings later on, CoinTracker automatically accounted for every single lot I ever received of each coin, even though many of these micro transactions of received interest/staking were virtually worthless. I also seem to have some very small transaction fee ""Sales"" with $0, for example I transferred SOL to an external wallet and the transaction fee was $0.00018. The Coinbase API still sent this transaction to CoinTracker, which in turn has it listed on my tax form as a sale of $0.

Anyway, because CoinTracker is reporting and tracking every single one of these $0 staking rewards, or miniscule transaction fees with no dollar value, they are showing up on my form 1099-B as sales, so I have a bunch of $0 sales listed. TurboTax is flagging these as an error and asking me to adjust the cost basis, but I can't, because they are essentially worthless. I guess TurboTax is confused because normally if you're selling something it has a value, but in this case each lot is so small and miniscule that there's literally no dollar value attached.

All this being said, I'm assuming I should just go ahead and delete anything that is $0, correct? I don't need to document sales of small lots with a worth of $0? Even if all those lots combined added up to a few cents, it's not like I'm going to get in trouble for not claiming them, correct? I'm assuming as long as I have anything of actual dollar value accounted for then I should be fine?

Possible explanations on the on-chain volume increase:

* Ordinals
* Silvergate bank liquidation
* US government moving recovered stolen funds
* High price volatility
* A fee 'bank run', with users preventing a possible bigger increase and moving their funds in advance or opening/closing channels on lightning.

Here’s a suggested list of specific measures for regulation.,"SEC seems to be going on a spree, but don’t think that’s a good way to regulate. Regulatory clarity is needed for the crypto industry.

Here are some measures to consider:

.

.

- Token Service Provider (crypto firm) should make segregation arrangements for customers’ assets. Customers’ assets should not be misused by the Token Service Provider.

- Token Service Provider should provide customers with a statement of account, comprising information on the customer’s assets and transactions, minimally on a monthly basis.

- Token Service Provider should establish a compensation process to handle any loss of such customers’ tokens, arising from incidents that is attributable to the operations of the crypto firm.

- Token Service Provider should declare the underlying revenue sources for their advertised 'staking' yields.

- Token Service Provider should not hypothecate the retail customer’s tokens.

- Token Service Provider may not invest in new token projects listed on their trading platform

- Token Service Provider that executes orders to purchase and sells tokens on behalf of their customers should not misuse any information relating to customers’ orders, and should prevent the misuse of such information by employees. 

- Trading platform operators should not buy or sell tokens for their own account; and permit their related corporations to buy or sell tokens for their own account on the crypto trading platform.

- Token Service Provider should disclose their token listing and governance policies. The disclosures should be sufficiently clear to allow customers to make informed decisions about the tokens offered.

- Token Service Provider should appoint a member of senior management, or committee of members, who are not directly involved in the provision of token services to oversee complaints handling. The complaints handling unit should not be directly involved in the provision of token services too.

- Information on its complaints handling process should be made publicly
available; while establishing a system to record, track and manage complaints too.

- Token service provider to ensure  that the maximum unscheduled downtime for critical systems does not exceed a total of 4 hours within any period of 12 months. 

- Token service provider should IT controls to protect customer information from unauthorised access or disclosure.

- Token service provider should not engage in the following practices:

**(a)** *Wash Trading, which is the buying and selling tokens with no change in
beneficial ownership, to create a false or misleading appearance of active
trading. This may be carried out through the creation of “ghost accounts” or other deceptive means, which seek to inflate trading volumes to give the appearance of rising popularity;*

**(b)** *Pump-and-Dump, which is to induce an increase in the price of a token
(“pump”) through the dissemination of false or misleading information, such as deceitful marketing and promotional ploys, before selling off their own holdings of the token (“dump”), ahead of other participants who would have been misled into buying the token;*

**(c)** *Cornering, which is to use a dominant controlling position in a token to
influence the price of the token and profit from that activity;*

**(d)** *Trade Spoofing, which is to place orders with the intention of cancelling them prior to being fulfilled, often by deploying trading bots and algorithms, to push the market price in a particular direction. These orders give the market a false sense of supply or demand; and*

**(e)** *Insider Trading, which refers to the buying or selling tokens while possessing material non-public information, such as an upcoming announcement of a listing decision.*

Hopefully this will be a good starting point for us to talk about crypto regulation in more specific terms.

   * in different jurisdictions - i.e. US, EU, UK, HK, Singapore, Australia
   * we can assume that the buyer can get USD easily and cheaply
* transferring the initial crypto to a good trading exchange (e.g. Binance, OKX, BitMEX, ByBit) minimising loss
   * What blockchains/intermediaries are reliable, cheap and reasonably fast?

10/3/23,AVAX is going to grow more than the general market,"I have been looking for a place to put my funds and after a few weeks looking at everything, I decided to buy a bunch of AVAX and delegate everything. I did that for a few reasons that are listed below.

&#x200B;

\- AVAX lost a lot of value because of LUNA: When the LUNA crash happened in May, AVAX lost more than 30% of its price due to concerns that the AVAX held by LUNA would be all sold at once. In the end, I think it never happened because people could not even find the AVAX that LUNA claimed that they had. At the time, BTC was about 40k. Due to this event, AVAX fell way more than the other altcoins in the same period, which makes it, in my opinion, undervalued.

&#x200B;

\- The token was launch at around 5 dollars: People usually want to enter early in tokens, but they never know exactly how to valuate those things. For AVAX, the launch price was about 5 dollars, which means that, right now, at 15, it is only a 200% increase from its launch price. The all time low was a little below 3 dollars, which means that if you invested 5k in AVAX right now, would basically be the same as if you invested 1k in its all time low. Considering this is a top 20 token, I would say the deal is pretty good. Personally, I think that if BTC reaches 12k, AVAX won't be below 8 dollars, specially now that they made a partnership with Amazon and with the Loco (that Indian game streaming platform). 

&#x200B;

\- They remained around top 20 even when the chain is considered ""a ghost town"": People say that AVAX has no adoption and that's why it will never be used for anything. Their base to make these allegations is the shitcoin market. Makes no sense to use shitcoins to evaluate a chain, but what makes sense is the decentralization of the chain (by the time I am writing this, it has 1220 validators, and the need a MINIMUM of 80% uptime if they want to receive any rewards, otherwise, their tokens will be locked until the end of the validation), and the low fees, which AVAX provides, aside from the number of transactions per second, which should be around 5000.

&#x200B;

\- Delegation is easy and validators simply cannot sell whenever they want: Validation and delegation in AVAX works by locking the tokens for a specific amount of time, which guarantees that those holders will have to wait for their lock to end they can do anything in case they are staking. That reduces some of the volatility.

   
And that's why I am only holding AVAX right now. Please, discuss your view and if you agree with the points I have made, but in general, I think AVAX is being negociated way below the price that it should be because of LUNA, while having a lot of speed and being one of the cheapest and most decentralized chains at the moment. If I said something wrong, please feel free to correct me. This is not a shilling attempt (which makes zero sense with a top 20 anyway), I just want to discuss my views on the token. My expectation is to have, at least, 1000% returns around the next BTC halving."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Here is the entire article so you dont have to give them clicks:

"" The traditional game of coin tossing has  long been a mainstay of betting and gambling. And with the development  of blockchain technology, coin tosses are now more exciting and fair  than ever before thanks to web3 Coin Flip.

Games on chain added their own twist to the Coinflip game by adding in a 3rd outcome  where the coin lands on the middle. What kind of Devilish idea was that?  You can say the Devil thought of it himself! If you guess it correctly,  it pays out 6 to 1.

Players can enjoy better privacy and  security with web3 Coin Flip in addition to its fairness and openness.  The blockchain records every bet and transaction made during the game,  making it impossible for anybody to tamper or influence the results.  Also if you win, you are instantly paid out.

How you ask?

When all my crypto exchange apps start signing me off, start lagging, asking me resign in without auto logging me etc.  

Almost every crash of course the apps don’t work well during the crash, but like a few days or the day before it for some reason I get logged out, asked to sign, need to re enter two factor authentication, need to reload the app etc.  

Now this is kind of a joke but those that are on the apps should will notice some of these things.  Like during the run from 16-23k? All my apps never once asked me re login, re enter two factor, reload the app ( it sits in the background and instantly loads for months on end).  

It’s not full proof because if it was it’s too easy, but this trick has saved me so many times to de risk.  

I know it’s running joke with friends and don’t follow it too much, but keep an eye on it and see if you notice these things or changes."

10/3/23,"Hear me out, the SVB crash solidifies the importance of companies holding their assets as crypto currencies","One of the key benefits of holding assets as crypto is that it provides a decentralized alternative to traditional banking systems. When companies hold their assets in a cryptocurrency, they essentially become their own bank. This means that they are not reliant on a third-party institution to store their funds, which can reduce the risk of a bank collapsing and leaving them with nothing.

Additionally, cryptocurrencies are designed to be highly secure and resistant to hacking and fraud. By utilizing advanced cryptography and decentralized networks, cryptocurrencies provide a level of protection that is difficult to replicate with traditional banking systems. This can further reduce the risk of a company losing their assets due to security breaches or other types of fraudulent activity.

Overall, holding assets as crypto can provide companies with greater financial security and peace of mind, as they are not dependent on a centralized banking system that may be vulnerable to collapse or other forms of instability. By embracing cryptocurrencies, companies can take control of their financial future and ensure that their assets are safe and secure."

Decentralized finance (DeFi) has been gaining popularity recently, but with its rise comes new security risks. According to Chainalysis, a blockchain data platform, one of the methods of hacking DeFi protocols that is on the rise is oracle manipulation. This type of attack involves artificially inflating the trading volume of a low-liquidity token on a DeFi protocol, which can cause the token's price to spike. In 2022 alone, hackers managed to steal a staggering $386.2 million from DeFi protocols using this method. As DeFi continues to grow in popularity, it's important to remain vigilant and consider the potential risks involved."

10/3/23,Cryptocurrency is not liberal or conservative. It is something new.,"As cryptocurrency discussions and debate continue in the US it seems like it's becoming more of a political thing to say being pro cryptocurrency is conservative and anti cryptocurrency is liberal.

I might be asking for the impossible but can we, at least here, try to not associate a position on cryptocurrency as having to do with being a republican or a democrat?

Here's a Decrypt article about Ron Wyden and his pro cryptocurrency stance. He's a democrat from my state. https://decrypt.co/94598/democrat-senator-ron-wyden-crypto-on-the-side-innovator?amp=1

I would consider myself liberal while also being extremely pro cryptocurrency. Why? Because look at these systems. Nearly every Blockchain and smart contract system are systems that are public and open for everyone to use, are maintained and administered by those that use them, and are systems that do not profit themselves. People simply pay the minimum required for them to function. The users, their activity, and use of these systems are not inputs to enrich a few people that control these systems. The value these systems create accrues to the tokens and is distributed among those that use these systems.

Think about DAOs. When people put their labors into many of these systems they're paid 100% of their labor minus the bare minimum necessary for the system to function. There is no corporation that employs the person and effectively taxes the value of their labor so it can be given to investors and management.

These systems are communist, anarchist, and liberal as fuck.

But they are also extremely dependent on personal freedoms, personal choices, free transparent markets which aren't controlled.

They are simultaneously conservative and libertarian as fuck.

Private corporations and governments are both the most powerful and wealthy institutions on this planet. And since the actions of these behemoth institutions affect us all we should have self and societal interest in limiting how much they both can affect cryptocurrency and sovereign Blockchain networks.

Once inside these systems they are simultaneously anti government yet also anti corporation. That does not stop corporations and governments from trying to do what they have always done with new things.  It also does not mean that these systems are anti governance or that they do not create material value.

These technologies seem to be creating something new. A bizzaro world where philosophies of libertarian capitalism and libertarian communism overlap and create environments that is the closest thing I've ever seen exist that is what both of these political philosophies have been really trying to figure out how to achieve.

Trying to create communism never worked because the only means we've ever known to get people to work for the benefit of all was by establishing human hierarchies with power and authority accruing to the top. So the masses were restricted and those at the top benefited and failed.

Libertarian capitalism never worked because it's human nature itself to form hierarchies. And so corporations with hierarchies form. To the victors go the spoils in competive markets. Wealth becomes concentrated at the top of the hierarchies. And again the masses are restricted and those are the top have the most freedoms and benefits.

Being pro cryptocurrency is not about being liberal or conservative.

Being pro cryptocurrency is about freedoms to choose, having autonomy, transparency, pro distribution and decentralization, pro structure, pro knowledge, pro information, anti hierarchy, people receiving the true values of their labors, maximizing collective good while also maximizing self interest and personal benefit.

This is not liberal or conservative.

This is something new."

[Did you check the beautiful red candles in the charts](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/033/136/cover2.jpg) and thought to yourself ""yup, im booking an extra shift this week"". Do you fear that your [""wealth"" is deteriorating?](https://assets.popbuzz.com/2017/08/rare-pepe-economy-1487773339-list-handheld-0.png) **Well, fear not, it's just numbers on a screen anyway.**

Okay in all seriousness, here are the three reasons why I am happy that we're once again dumping:

# 1. Fake pumps = lost money. 

Did anyone seriously buy the recent pumps? Yeah we're still trading higher than what we ended 2022 with but there was absolutely no reason to believe that we're in a bull run, just because [jpowell said good words in speech.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FYsi3OxXwAE1qp2.png). These random pumps are just manipulating retail investors, drawing the FOMO suckers in again, enticing them to use degenerate leverage techniques and then t-bagging them all the way to the bottom.

**Lesson 1: Don't buy the pumps that are based on nothing. Real pumps will be caused when major news of adoption are announced, when regulators figure their shit out, when big institutions rejoin.** [(No Elon, not you again, go away)](https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-82650382/Elon%20and%20BTC%20meme.jpg)

# 2. We. Need. To. Flush. The. Dirt. Out. 

So many awfully ran companies joined the crypto space over the past years. 99% of them aiming to capitalize on the non-informed. FOMO works in pairs, there are those who want to make money and then those who ""help"" them do so by actually scamming them. It's human psychology. Scammers capitalizing on human greed [(Celsius, Voyager and the self-proclaimed ""crypto custodians"")](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107074612-1655108062602-gettyimages-1236340828-PO1_0004.jpeg?v=165726882). Then there's the absolute limit of stupidity, FTX and the Ala**meth**a Research Fund.

**Lesson 2: Until all the turds are flashed down, there's no point waiting for pumps.**

# 3. BUY! 

If you were thinking of buying btc at $60k, what's stopping you now from buying at $20k? *""Because it might go lower.""* Well yeah, that's the point of this post. That we buy as long as the prices are low! Personally, I want to keep DCAing for at least a couple more years. Why would I be happy if my electronic wealth is worth 5% more than yesterday? I just wanna buy as many bitcoins as possible.

And of course, I know that having buying power is a ""privilage"" or at least not everyone is in the same situation. The economy sucks right now and chances are that unemployment will increase. [(Jpowell is getting his Christmas wish soon)](https://preview.redd.it/the-fed-doesnt-know-when-inflation-will-come-down-we-live-v0-pe6zaf802ama1.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=02ba57d445a3afcde93e96c1179547957343cdd7)

But remember, this is a very, very long game. We've still got many [halvings](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/bitcoin-halving-how-does-the-halving-cycle-work-and-why-does-it-matter) to go, many [adoption stories](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/07/world/americas/el-salvador-bitcoin.html), more [regulatory scrutiny](https://www.investopedia.com/news/how-sec-regs-will-change-cryptocurrency-markets/), many more [exchanges/custodian/hedge fund collapses to go](https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/10/23450169/crypto-winter-ftx-binance-celsius-bitcoin). **It simply doesn't matter if we're up 5% today and -10% tomorrow.** (pls don't invest more than you can afford to lose)

tl;dr: 1. fake pumps = fomo and lost money, 2. flush out the dirt, get rid of the scammers and grifters, 3. dca when prices are low."

When the price was going up last month I was first of all very surprised, because the sentiment was suddenly very positive again.

10/3/23,I'm Looking to accept Bitcoin for my local food truck. Some advice needed please!,"I have been using Bitcoin for years, since 2013 actually and I have had my share of buying and selling but I have never bought commercially as part of a business.

This season, I would like to accept Bitcoin. I fully expect to get zero customers but if nothing else it should be a talking point.

With that said, what is the best way to accept payments. I know there are terminals and apps and things but I was hoping to keep it simple. I was thinking to just use Electrum.

Personally, I love Electrum and it seems it would be just perfect if the other person also uses Electrum.

Basically I just want to make a small few $ sale generate a QR which the buyer then scans from their wallet and that's it. Transaction done.
The problem is that I tried a test sale with my daughter. She uses IOS (I use Electrum on Android) and Electrum isn't available for IOS. We downloaded the top rated app from the App store but it was shit. I sent $3 and I couldn't even figure how to send it to Electrum. It didn't even seem to support QR codes. This was one of those multi crypto apps btw.

So, how do I as a seller accept sales in Bitcoin. Ideally using Electrum? Was I just unlucky doing a test sale with my daughter on IOS. She is hard work at the best of times."

The upside from adoption, which started at zero and is headed towards hyperbitcoinization, allows you to reclaim the wealth stolen from your parents, grandparents and so on. They worked hard, but the fruits of their labour were taken away from them by the parasitical class. Now you can claim that wealth back. Your ancestors left you an inheritance, hidden away from you in the pockets and vaults of the politicians and bankers. Bitcoin transfers that generational wealth into yours where it rightfully belongs."

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

* [Article: The Bullish Case for Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@vijayboyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1)
* [Book: The Bitcoin Standard](https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861) - or [download a free copy here](https://www.z-epub.com/book/1712)

Some other great resources include Michael Saylor's [Hope.com](https://hope.com/) and [""Bitcoin for Everybody""'](https://learn.saylor.org/course/view.php?id=468) course, Jameson Lopp's [resource page](http://lopp.net/bitcoin.html), Gigi's [resource page](https://bitcoin-resources.com/#bitcoin-non-technical), and James D'Angelo's [Bitcoin 101 Blackboard series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhe61JaNFLU&list=PLzctEq7iZD-7-DgJM604zsndMapn9ff6q&index=7&t=0s).  Some excellent writing on Bitcoin's value proposition and future can be found at the [Satoshi Nakamoto Institute](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/).

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](http://bitcoinsimplified.org/learn-more/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/lightning-network-technical-summary.pdf), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/)
* [Gemini](https://gemini.com/)
* [Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/)
* [BitFinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/)
* [Xapo](https://xapo.com/)
* [Cex](https://cex.io/)
* [Bottlepay](https://bottlepay.com/)
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn computer security best practices, then a hardware wallet such as the [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/) or [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/) is recommended.

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to let third party **""Bitcoin banks""** manage your coins, try [Gemini](https://gemini.com/) or [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware you may not be in control of your private keys in which case you would have to ask permission to access your funds and be exposed to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. This means that if you don't store your coins in a wallet that you control the keys to, then you do not really own your bitcoin as you have to ask permission from the third party in order to move them.  

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

Both Coinbase and Gemini support physical security keys. 


## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions you can [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

The Bitcoin Node version 24.0.1 is now available to download from GitHub. 

Question, my node is already running version 24.0.0, and its fully synced up which took me about 4 days. 

How can I upgrade to this new 24.0.1 version? Surely I don't have to download this new version (24.0.1) and sync up my node all over again?? 

Thanks.

I thought of some factors like the stock market, the price of gold, the interest rate, even the impact of tweets on the price of the bitcoin.

The problem is that there are several other research papers are done on these factors.

Does someone discovered a factor that is not too popular.

10/3/23,"13 years ago Laszlo Hanyecz spent 10,000 BTC for two pizzas, in one of the 300 BTC transactions that happened on that day. How was the network back then and what has changed?","We all know about the famous [two-pizza buy for 10,000 BTC](https://nypost.com/2021/05/24/bitcoin-pizza-guy-who-squandered-365m-has-no-regrets/), which took place on March 22nd 2010. **How was the network back then and what has changed?**

I've gathered some data from Nasdaq and did some rookie charts for you fine folk.

# On that day, there were only 300 transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain

It is insane to think on how early those people were. **Yesterday's number of transaction was 975x higher**. If you look at the chart, it does put things in perspective:

# Only 2.86 million BTC had been mined

This accounts for roughly 13.63% of the 21M Bitcoins that will ever exist.

# There were only 299 unique addresses used on that day

As of yesterday, this number was 2195x times higher, with 656385 unique addresses used.

Interesting to see that the number of unique addresses used correlates quite well with the number of transactions, at least visually.

# TL;DR

Check the title of each section.

It is really nice to see how the network has developed after the first documented buy with BTC ever. Laszlo's pizza order put BTC into the news and set a landmark: you could trade it for goods. We have come a long way and have an even longer way to go!"

10/3/23,US Debt Spiral (Macro Question),"I've read through these articles quite a few times since they've come out.  They are really crazy to think about and consider what the ramifications will be.

[https://jameslavish.substack.com/p/-whats-a-debt-spiral-and-is-the-us](https://jameslavish.substack.com/p/-whats-a-debt-spiral-and-is-the-us)

[https://www.lynalden.com/broke-federal-reserve/](https://www.lynalden.com/broke-federal-reserve/)

My questions is what happens to the prices of real estate and stocks as we progress through this debt spiral?  I have friends who say well if I know the USD is inflating and more money will come into the system and therefore I know that real estate and the stock market will keep going up as denominated in USD.... then why wouldn't I just keep buying real estate?  

It will go up long term over the next 5-8 years because of quantitative easing that will occur but when does that stop?  When do assets start taking a hit from the debt monetizing that will occur in the US?  When will they normalize or go down from this inflation of USD?  What will cause that?  What will it look like?

I know for bonds what is likely to happen is the fed will buy bonds themselves to artificially keep the interest rate on them low.  So to me it makes sense why bonds would be a bad investment long term when a debt spiral occurs.  For this reason I never envision myself buying and holding bonds long term again."
10/3/23,Banks on Verge of Collapse | Silvergate & SVB Contagion Spreads,
10/3/23,Silicon Valley in Crisis: Panic and Uncertainty as SVB Bank Collapses,"Banking panic has hit Silicon Valley following the collapse of SVB bank. The news has shaken the heart of the tech ecosystem and has generated uncertainty among investors and entrepreneurs who rely on the bank to finance their projects.

SVB is one of the main banks in Silicon Valley and has been essential in financing the growth of numerous startups in the area. However, the global financial crisis has negatively impacted its investments and has led to a series of financial problems that ultimately resulted in the bank's collapse.

The collapse of SVB has generated a domino effect in the Silicon Valley economy. Many startups that rely on the bank to finance their projects have been affected, as they now face a lack of capital and the closure of credit lines. Additionally, investors have lost confidence in the market, leading to a decrease in venture capital investment in the region.

Banking panic has quickly spread among investors and entrepreneurs, who fear that the collapse of SVB is just the tip of the iceberg of a broader financial crisis. Many are wondering if other Silicon Valley banks are also at risk and if the region's economy is in danger of collapsing.

Amidst this climate of uncertainty, financial authorities have tried to reassure the public and have taken measures to protect bank customers. However, many investors and entrepreneurs remain concerned about the future of their businesses and the financial health of the Silicon Valley ecosystem as a whole.

In this context, it is important to remember that Silicon Valley has overcome financial crises in the past and has demonstrated great resilience. The region has a unique entrepreneurial culture and a strong community of entrepreneurs and investors who have been able to adapt to market changes and overcome obstacles.

Although the collapse of SVB has been a blow to the Silicon Valley economy, it can also be an opportunity to reflect on the excessive dependence on traditional banks in financing startups. In the future, new forms of financing may be sought, such as crowdfunding or cryptocurrencies, which allow entrepreneurs and investors to diversify their investment options and reduce their dependence on banks.

In summary, the banking panic in Silicon Valley following the collapse of SVB is understandable, but it is also important to remain calm and remember the region's ability to overcome financial crises. It is likely that the Silicon Valley economy will adapt to market changes and find new ways of financing to drive the growth of startups."

10/3/23,Bitcoin Blocks Puzzle Strategy," A new game by THNDR Games dropped to the Apple app store and the Google Play Store yesterday. The new game is called Bitcoin Blocks Puzzle Strategy. 

 If you are familiar with any of the THNDR Games, the process is the same:

Play the game, get tickets, enter the hourly draw, and when that draw happens you win Satoshis.

After all that you can claim them to your own lightning wallet, as simple as that.

**How does this game work?**

This game is a mix between 2 games, Sudoku and Tetris. You have to put the Tetris looking blocks in the Sudoku map. Each time you put a block on the game map you gain score, and each time you get 100 points, you get one tickets which automatically enters the hourly draw.

**Multipliers**

Sometimes, you can see numbers on the game map, when you put a block on that number your score gets multiplied by it.

If you manage to eliminate a piece with an orange block your multiplier goes up by 1.

**How do you win?**

You can see underneath the game map something called ""Level""

Each time you put 3 blocks on the map you go to the next level.

You win the game when you reach level 25.

**What are leagues?**

THNDR Games introduced the leagues system in the Club Bitcoin Solitaire game.

In leagues, you play against 9 other players in your league, to try and go up to the next league and why not try to be the first.

In each league you get to, the number of players going up or going down the leagues changes.

**What's new?**

With the introduction of the new game, something new got introduced also into the mix.

We all for now know Nostr and its benefits, well, THNDR Games introduced THNDR Badges that you can get just by playing Solitaire or Blocks, and all of that is achievable by only putting you public key or ""npub"" in the settings inside the Solitaire or Blocks game.

 And these badges follow you wherever you go on Nostr.

You can see these badges, on your Nostr profile.

 This is a small introduction to the new Bitcoin Blocks game by THNDR Games.

This is a blog post also from their website: [https://www.thndr.games/post/nostr-setup](https://www.thndr.games/post/nostr-setup)

10/3/23,Bitcoin rewards the intelligent (and lucky) first.,"I was thinking about how pompous I could be at times when it comes to Bitcoin. I always think that it’s so obvious that Bitcoin is going to be the become the next world’s reserve currency, the USD will collapse in the next 10 years or less, my entire body feels the shift in the world’s energy, and the only currency that will exist in 20 years.

I feel so honoured to be part of a group of most Intelligent people on our planet, we are the first few million Bitcoiners minted, we are so early when it comes to time, but don’t be surprised if the price skyrockets after the next FED hike. People who were going to “invest” in a house are already on edge, but these same people will have a change of mind and many will invest in Bitcoin once they find out the benefits of Bitcoin over real estate. The FED is triggering one of the biggest minting of new Bitcoiners and they don’t even know it!

I started my Bitcoin journey beginning in 2022, I HODLed for an entire year watching the price go down, I watched all the Bitcoin documentaries available on YouTube, I read 6 Bitcoin books, and I’m on my 7th one. I’ve listened to countless interviews, learned about the history of silver, gold, etc, and I’m not just convinced, I’m 100% certain Bitcoin will reach new all time highs by 2025 it’ll make a lot of people millionaires, and in control of that wealth. With our gifted intellect we can create solutions for the worlds problems and heal the world. 

We are getting close to 10% of world Bitcoin adoption! It takes the same time from 0-10% as it takes from 10-90%, this is why we are at the beginning of the S-curve. Not to mention, Hong Kong is opening retail trading in June! If you don’t know, HK has a high concentration of wealth and financial geniuses there. 

I forget that very few people in the world understand what Bitcoin is, and what it will become. Cheers to us early adopters. 
I just wanted to say we are actual geniuses, and Bitcoin is going to reward us, the highly intelligent. Much love and respect 🫡 ✊"

Since I've bought these items P2P, I do not have any receipts, only transaction history.

Now the exchange has a history of me buying and interacting with my bitcoin, but no history of me selling them.

Check out a few search statistics on football - seems insane: Most football clubs have 2M+ searches per month on Google, with some players like Ronaldo in Europe around 13Million searches - which, in his own right, is like the combined search volume for 5 X football clubs.

So these boys are playing with serious brands like Nike and Adidas - and they're building ordinary folks up to become gods and brands - and then monetize it in ways we are yet to understand. 

VC's and hedge funds are quiet - but many are moving. So how can we learn more about the size of the football market and the strategic advantages these ""multi club owners"" are pursuing?

Many of its clients are cryptocurrency companies and digital asset traders who use Silvergate Bank's banking services to transact with cryptocurrencies and move funds between cryptocurrency markets and traditional banks.

The closure of Silvergate Bank could also impact investor confidence in the crypto sector, as it could raise concerns about the security and stability of banking services for cryptocurrency companies and lead to questions about other banks' ability to serve the growing demand for cryptocurrency banking services.

It is important to note that there is currently no news that Silvergate Bank is going to close. Therefore, any hypothetical impact on the cryptocurrency market would be purely speculative at this point."

The judge has also overruled the Security and Exchange Commission’s objection to the deal, but the regulator’s objection could still thwart the selling process.  


As [AIBC reported](https://twitter.com/AIBCsummit/status/1633786739905929216?cxt=HHwWgICx7ceYsKwtAAAA), Voyager will receive $20 million from Binance.US for the assets the lending crypto firm held for customers.  


Still, some hurdles remain before the deal is finalized. Specifically, The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is investigating possible national security risks associated with the investment. Binance.US has maintained that it is fully independent of its parent company Binance.  


If the deal goes through, Voyager customers can begin to make withdrawals. The company has explicitly said this would allow customers to recover 73% of their value.  


I also read that the judge rejected the SEC’s efforts to find Voyager executives if they decide to issue bankruptcy tokens to reimburse customers. The SEC argued that a bankruptcy token would represent an unregistered security token offering.  


At the same time, disgraced former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried hasn’t showed up to give his testimony in the Voyager case."

10/3/23,Utah introduces new bill to recognize DAOs,"Utah passed a new bill (HB 0357) on 1 March for DAOs to be recognized as legal persons rather than corporate entities. The bill will come into effect on 1 January 2024, making Utah the first State to legalize DAOs. The COALA DAO Model Law inspired the law. New Hampshire will follow soon, with the same bill being under review.  


Until now, there has been a lack of legal recognition for DAOs, which has created many challenges and unnecessary risks for those involved in DAOs.   


Recognizing the ‘personhood’ of a DAO would allow more interaction and a smooth transition with other businesses providing limited liability to members.  


As it seems from everything I read on [AIBC](https://twitter.com/AIBCsummit/status/1633754952421236736?cxt=HHwWgIDT0aTeoawtAAAA) DAOs will not need a corporate structure.  


The law will give DAOs the same functional benefits as corporations or LLCs. However, an LLC will not be a DAO, and a DAO will not be an LLC.  


DAOs will need to meet some minimum requirements. They will be permitted to govern human resources, networks, and protocols for open-source software and manage funds. Although many kinds of DAOs are blockchain-based and have borderless forms of social and business organization, with a shared wallet and a governance process more open to diverse stakeholders than traditional companies.

10/3/23,Entire Coinbase account was hacked,"Is this the proper place to post about how I had ballpark $45,000 in crypto drained from my Coinbase account in 24 hours and I was able to recover it from Coinbase. Let me know before I post details. Thanks."
10/3/23,Account Frozen,"Quality of service from Coinbase has deteriorated immensely over the years. I’ve read plenty of horror storiesbut still choose to use this platform. My mentality was no issues for me so no need to jump ship. That was until recently. 

I’ve had my account for several years. For the most part I no major issues until recently. Last year coinbase deactivated purchases with debit cards on my account which was aggravating. I didn’t realize I had an old debit card linked to my account and tried to make a purchase. It was declined. I updated the card information and then got permanently restricted from using debit cards. The debit card was in my name and associated with my home address. I was told by support that the restriction isn’t reversible. That should have been my cue to leave. Things only got worse for me. 

2 days ago I updated by banking information on the app. I have 3 bank accounts linked. All three accounts are in my name. 2 of the accounts have my home address. The 3rd account is my business account and uses the company’s address. I made 3 ACH deposited on 3/7/23 in the amounts of $2k, $2k and $3k. I know from previous deposits it takes 10 days to clear. Two days later I go to make another deposit using Paypal and find my account is restricted. I can’t buy or trade cryptocurrency. I contact support and they tell me I need to answer a bunch of questions. At this point I’m furious that they restricted my account without any warning after being a loyal client for years. I tell the representative I want to withdraw my deposits and close my account. She tells me I need to wait 8 weeks before I can do that. At this point I reached an entirely new level of anger. How dare this company take my money and then hold it hostage for 2 months. If they don’t want me to trade on their platform, that’s fine by me. It’s completely unacceptable to hold onto my money. 

It seems on this forum that there are hundreds of similar stories of frozen accounts and withdraws being withheld. This company doesn’t value it’s customers at all. I for one will never use coinbase again after I’ve withdraw all my money. I don’t care if they lift all my restrictions. This company has developed a horrible reputation and it’s well deserved."
10/3/23,SMS verification code,"Seem to be having trouble with receiving my SMS verification code from coinbase? Seemed OK 6 weeks or so ago.

Any ideas? 

I've tried restarting and updating the app.

The same with Binance it seems.

10/3/23,Sent Euro SEPA Deposit without customer reference,"And then had an experience with coinbase with their deposit and forgot the customer reference?

How to contact Coinbase directly?

Thanks"
10/3/23,Sending both ETH/Solana chain USDC to Coinbase,"I have sent USDC on the ETH and Solana chains both to Coinbase, but they show up as one asset combined. Are they all converted to one chain automatically? How do I know I don't accidentally send some USDC on the wrong chain from coinbase in the future if they arent combined?"

10/3/23,Unsubscribe from the constant spam? I don't even have an account.,"Coinbase keeps spamming me with ""important notifications"" and I can't even find an unsubscribe button.

10/3/23,$1000 Deposit no longer instantly Available to send on my account,I used to be able to deposit $1000 USD or less from my bank account to my CB account and have it instantly available to withdraw and use. But now it's asking me to wait 7 days. Did something change here?
10/3/23,Adding a new debit card to coinbase through the website,"I just wanted to share this experience that I had today.

I got a new debit card recently, and today I tried to connect it to my coinbase account. The bank that I use, and my old debit card from this same bank have been connected to coinbase for years, with no issue.

I inserted my card info and got an error message with no real information about the issue or its solution. I tried again, and got a message telling me that I have tried too many times to connect my card, and I have to wait twelve hours.

I contacted coinbase's chat service and spoke to a woman. She told me that there was a charge on my card that I needed to verify. When I explained that I saw the charge on my bank account, but I was never prompted on the website to enter this number. She sent me a few copy/paste messages that didn't help me. When I stated that none of this was helpful, she ended the chat.

I don't think that's ever happened before. Anyway, I got on another chat, with a guy named Bryan. Aside from his own copy/paste messages that didn't address my concern and leaving me hanging for minutes on end, only to return with what amounted to gibberish, he was slightly more helpful, in that he said ""We're running this up the chain, so you'll get an email about it later on.""

That sucked, because I really wanted to transfer that money. I figured I'd give it a shot later on, after work.

I got home from work and saw the email they sent me about my issue of not being able to connect my debit card. Here's what it said:

>Hi chimchooree

> Coinbase aims to provide the correct resolution to your concern and we are doing our best to respond as quickly as possible. Our chat support team escalated your case to further assist your concern about adding your card as your payment method. Allow us to provide clarity to make sure this gets addressed immediately.
> 
> After a detailed review of your account, card buys cannot be approved for your account.
> 
> For the security of our users and accounts, we are not able to provide specific information regarding how this determination was made. This means our support cannot provide more details on why this decision was made, nor are we able to re-evaluate.
> 
> Please use alternative options to fund your account, you can find more information on your country’s funding options here https://www.coinbase.com/places.
> 
> We appreciate your understanding in this matter. We hope this clarifies your concern. Thank you for choosing Coinbase.
> 

To be honest, it didn't clarify anything.

But here I realized something. I don't have a smartphone. I just don't use one. I've been trying all day on my computer. What if I used my android emulator?

Well, it worked like a charm. I was done in about two minutes. Now, how come Bryan or the woman I talked to couldn't have just said, ""Hey, use the app""? 

I know there was a language barrier, and I tried to be as patient and clear as I could be. I went through two levels of being pushed off with auto-responses before being told by what I am assuming is a real person over email that I can't use my card at all, and they can't tell me why. 

Am I crazy, or is that a lot of incompetence from people who ultimately want my money?

Whatever. Now I know—use the stupid phone app."

I've tried ID verification and it said that it would take days so I have already closed that window, I've guessed I've made a blunder as I got an email saying I am verified now.

It seems weird to me as I got a text to send for the id but I still am not getting one for my verification so it means that I can be messaged just not getting any verification messages."

How are these in the stores???? My non-tech savvy friend recently got scammed out of her monthly salary by some douchebags on Facebook and Discord and WhatsApp (I know coinbase doesn't use Facebook and no company uses Whatsapp but she is not IT literate this is not the point here).

&#x200B;

So my friend is working for a company called Deel who explained how to get her pay cheque from Peru into Argentina, she buys Crypto on coinbase and then sends it to LemonCash and from LemonCash to Mercado Pago (I have never heard of the latter two). She's been doing this since May last year (Viva la Crypto!).

This week she sent $344 USD to CoinBase, then to LemonCash, but after it didn't arrive in her LemonCash account she checked and the LemonCash address was different now in her app (this is a separate issue I am looking into, the money may be still at the old LemonCash address).

&#x200B;

She tried to contact support for LemonCash and Coinbase, and somehow she found a profile on facebook, she assures me it was Coinbase and she got a reply. Now I've asked her to ""view profile"" of the message she received and of course it's not Coinbase, it's [https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100090397572329](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100090397572329) some shitty scam that should not exist. This is another snake in the grass we need to eradicate.

&#x200B;

I digress, they told her that a coinbase representative would be in contact via Whatsapp (lol) once she sent them her number. The number +14084095329 contacted her with a Coinbase profile pic and told her she needed to download the ""coinbase wallet"" which is the link that most definitely is not coinbase. They then asked her to deposit 124 USDC to activate the wallet (you see where this is going). So some ""friend"" in her work discord said he could *help* by sending 124 USDC to her wallet! The friend supposedly sent the USDC but it never arrived, then ""coinbase support"" told her she needed to deposit $50 USD to receive the funds, which she did in that not-coinbase-app and it appeared then disappeared.

&#x200B;

None of this would be possible if Facebook, Apple and Google weren't so unbelievably shitty at their job. And Coinbase should be actively shutting this shit down too.

&#x200B;

Look, the money is gone, nobody is disputing that, but you could at least do the minimum due diligence to protect your customers.

10/3/23,Is Binance collapsing?,"I’d ask this question on the binance thread but it won’t let me. 

BUSD had a market cap of of 17billion a month ago and has declined about 50% to a 8.4billion market cap. The past few days it has stayed at this number even though the crypto market lost 100billion from the total market since then.

BUSD normally had a trading volume of around 30% of market cap and is now currently trading at 105% of market cap.

I don’t follow binance or use it and was wondering if anyone knows what issues they are having with their platform.

Before the diehard binance fans go crazy like last time I’m not saying BUSD will depeg from the dollar I’m saying customers are choosing to switch to a different stable coin"

The attackers exploited the code of the Hedera mainnet to transfer Hedera Token Service tokens held in victims' accounts to their own accounts. The attackers targeted liquidity pools on multiple DEXs, including Pangolin, SaucerSwap, and HeliSwap, that had ported Hedera tokens over to the network's smart contract service via a bridge. To prevent further theft of tokens, Hedera temporarily turned off the ""mainnet proxies,"" which removed users' access to the mainnet. The team is currently working on a solution to patch the vulnerability.

10/3/23,Thailand To Ban Crypto Staking And Lending?,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of Thailand has published a draft regulation seeking public feedback on the prohibition of digital asset business operators' provision of or involvement with lending and staking services, which it calls ""crypto saving"" or ""crypto deposit taking."" The regulator cites the probability of firms falling into insolvency as the reason for the ban, and aims to provide greater protection to investors, reduce associated risks, and prevent a misunderstanding that deposit-taking and lending services are under the same supervision as regulated digital asset businesses. The proposed regulation will essentially ban digital asset business operators from accepting deposits for staking and lending, paying regular interest for depositing digital assets, and advertising or persuading of crypto staking and lending services. Stakeholders and interested parties can submit their comments and suggestions through the SEC's website or email by April 7, 2023."

It is an app that allows paying with any self-custody wallet at any retailer, similar to how you use a regular credit card.

The website states that it works even offline so you don't need to worry about losing connection.

Seems to work in 3 steps:

1.- Connect the wallet

2.- Initiate the payment

3.- Pay with your smartphone by tapping the point of sale, just like a contactless card

So far, the most exciting method I have found.

 I have both CDC and Binance card. The CDC is the ruby so 1% cashback and for binance 2%.  
Now... about the cashback... of course I should use binance to gain it more but... should I use CDC instead to have more value when will be a bull run? I mean.. CDC could be double easier than BNB (from 0,07 to 0,14).
