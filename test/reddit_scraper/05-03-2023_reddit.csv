A couple drinks into the night, the guy kept checking his phone in between chit chat when I recognized the CoinGecko banner logo with red squiggly lines going across screen. I figured ‚ÄúHey thats the crypto market on Coingecko, something we can bond about!‚Äù 

He asked me if I was ‚Äúinto crypto‚Äù with a slight smug face. I said ‚Äúyea been investing for a few years.‚Äù The guy proceeds to tell me how he invests in a lot of new coins because you ‚Äúnever know which will be fire.‚Äù Sitting there puzzled the only thing I could say is ‚ÄúCool?‚Äù

Later after a few ‚ÄúFOMO‚Äôs‚Äù and a couple ‚Äúto the moon‚Äù statements about investing by this guy he decides to tell us about one of his new ventures. Him and his gym bros are in the process of starting a crypto YouTube channel about how to ‚Äúbag the sweetest NFTs.‚Äù I followed up by asking if the channel is just about NFTs and his response is ‚ÄúYea bro. ‚ÄúNFT‚Äôs are where it‚Äôs at bro.‚Äù

My wife and I had a few chuckles on the way home but with a heartfelt uneasiness for our daughter. I wish my daughter well and I‚Äôll stand by her whatever happens but Eric (daughters old bf) if you are out there, ‚ÄúI miss you lil buddy.‚Äù"

It wasn't an easy choice.But I chose crypto.Food is overrated anyways.I mean,sure it keeps me alive and all that but it cannot make me rich.

4/3/23,"We need RuneScape type games, but with Crypto abstracted in where it‚Äôs beneficial or doesn‚Äôt take away from the game!","I was just thinking about how I started out playing Runscape nearly 15 years ago in elementary school, and I played enough to where if the things I owned were NFT‚Äôs I probably wouldn‚Äôt have had to work a day in my life! 

Now it‚Äôs been years since I‚Äôve played, but I still want that type of game format, but I‚Äôm old enough now that if I‚Äôm gonna game, I want to earn real world value. Are there any games like this that anyone knows of or anything like this being built? I feel like it would be a beast of a game, and I want it to be actually P2E, rather than pay to play like all other blockchain games that say they are P2E. This gave me some ideas on how I‚Äôd want to structure a Runscape type of blockchain game.

I don‚Äôt want to buy an NFT in a marketplace, to participate. I want to grind the game and earn real world value through NFT‚Äôs that I earn from my time spent/skill level. Not by buying an NFT to even play the game, and then saying I‚Äôm playing to earn by earning an inflated away currency. 

The game should be free to play, and only include transactions, when I claim my reward for a task, quest or something of that sort. Simply put, current blockchain games don‚Äôt abstract the blockchain out enough. We need games that include minimal blockchain, in my opinion. 

NFT‚Äôs should be the earnable item, not a token or at least not solely a token. Also, a token or multiple can exist, but they should serve a purpose, and not be a catch all token of money to be inflated away as well as the security token and governance token. The currency of blockchain games are the worst part of a game usually, because it‚Äôs never well thought out or is a catch all, doom to never actually serve a purpose, and therefore ends up losing a lot of value.

If this type of game exists or being built with a , please give me some details so I can check the project out!

EDIT: what‚Äôs in it for the game Dev‚Äôs? Royalties on NFT trades, just like all other NFT devs are incentivized with. They could release special release NFTs, that people can pay for if they‚Äôd like. They could monetize their own portion of the map, where you need something special, to play in ‚Äútheir area‚Äù, which is essentially pay to play in their area. I mentioned a token in the post, they could absolutely create a token, or some other form of value added that can be derived to them, but the point is, the entire game should not only derive value to them. They should find innovative ways to take some value in micro transactions or other ways that add some value, but don‚Äôt take away from the usability."
4/3/23,"With all the bad economic happenings in the world, I see no reason why would we expect a bullrun anytime soon?","
Central banks, whether we like them or not, may take longer than expected to bring inflation under control.

This year we hit records with inflation.

Otherwise, I'm not a pessimist, I didn't even make a profit for myself with cryptocurrencies because of my greed, but it seems to me that this state of the market will last for a long time.

What's worse, I don't know if we can expect a new ATH, or even a return of the bullrun, for a long time at all.

I don't know, maybe we just need a little hopium."
3/3/23,"Over 67,000 Moons Burned This Week! üî•","Hey all,

I've been exploring the Arbiscan API to gather some insights about Moon burning activity, and here's what I found:

# This Week

27 Feb - 03 Mar

This week, 67,399 Moons were burned in 20 different transactions. Of those, 99.69% (67,191 Moons) were burned for AMAs/Banner Rent, and 0.31% (208 Moons) were used for purchasing Special Memberships/Reddit Coins.

The burn rate this week is approximately 401.18 Moons/hour or 9,628.43 Moons/day. The largest transaction burned 30,000 Moons, which represents 44.51% of the weekly total.

# This Round

15 Feb - 27 Mar

Since the last snapshot, 76,835 Moons were burned in 81 different transactions. Around 4,822 Moons will be reintroduced in the next round (so far), and 72,013 Moons are permanently removed from circulation.

4/3/23,How they will kill crypto: By adopting it.,"
tl;dr I think this is one of the best things I‚Äôve ever written, and it is the result of a huge amount of research. It‚Äôs less than 2000 words, please just give it a go.

---

First, let‚Äôs identify the participants in this conflict:

**The Idealists**:  The crypto builders driven by idealistic vision and talent, who are building out scalable micro-economies whose defining characteristics are full accountability, transparency and verifiability.  

They want to build a world where even the most powerful network participants, the biggest and richest organisations on the planet, are constrained by rules that are fair, that are unbreakable due to cryptographic guarantees, and that can be verified by *anyone* to be functioning as intended.  A massive improvement on the current system.   More democratic, more resistant to corruption and collusion, and not just better but provably better.

**The Charlatans**: Money focussed parasitic grifters who latch on to the technological narratives of crypto and seek to enrich themselves.  Their ‚Äújob‚Äù is essentially to provide a credible narrative to retail that draws on the real advances being made, while not actually intending to make a valuable contribution to the space beyond lining their own pockets.  Their effect is to massively muddy the waters about what is being built, what it can do, and who is building it.

**The Institutions**:  The big end of town. The guys with their hands on all the levers, who have always been ‚Äútoo big to fail‚Äù and who have so much power and control that they can literally stop the game and move their chips around when it looks like they are about to lose.

  They have a huge vested interest in maintaining the status quo, and immense resources of money, media and enforcement at their back.  They will not take a transition to an opt-in, verifiable, disintermediated global economy lying down. The promises of fairness and accountability provided by crypto are anathema to their endless goal of wielding more and more power.

---

  Now, say you‚Äôre the Institutions, and you have witnessed the explosive growth of crypto, both in terms of the fundamental technological advances as well as the speculative penny stock casino built on top of it. Every penny that moves into decentralised economies moves out of your immediate control, and what was once millions of dollars is now billions, and looks on course to be trillions in the near future.
  What do you do?  I will outline a two step process of how they are fighting their battle. Step 1 is well underway, Step 2 is being built as we speak.

  Step 1 is you want to hobble the Idealists as much as possible.  While you can‚Äôt shut down the technology in one stroke, and indeed, you don‚Äôt want to, as many of the developments coming out of crypto have revolutionary applications for your own businesses, you want as few people as possible building in the ‚Äúidealists‚Äù camp.  The people trying to build fair systems are the enemy, when you profit from an unfair system, and you want as few people recruited into that as possible.

  You do this from a wide range of angles. On one front, you restrict their access to traditional banking services, making it very difficult for Web3 native companies to interface with regular banks.  Nic Carter has a fantastic article laying out the many, many ways that they are doing this:

https://www.piratewires.com/p/crypto-choke-point

  On top of this, you create a regulatory environment that is deliberately designed around a lack of clarity.  Many Web3 native companies talk about how they‚Äôve tried to approach the SEC with the question ‚ÄúHow do we play by the rules?‚Äù only to be turned away, followed by the SEC crowing about how ‚ÄúAll they need to do is play by the rules‚Äù. This uncertainty, along with seemingly random enforcement actions (that often target the most credible firms in the space rather than the most egregious scammers) creates a very difficult environment for crypto firms that *want to be good* to get anything done.

  I have seen this expressed as a sign that the government doesn‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs doing. On the contrary, I think this is their absolutely intentional goal. To keep crypto developers on shaky ground, to slow development, to slow recruitment into the Idealists camp, and to generally hobble the industry to buy time for Step 2, which I will describe below.
Another way to hobble the industry is to undermine it as an investment vehicle.  I wrote earlier

https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/10or6kz/how_they_are_killing_crypto_without_anyone/

about how many promising early stage products are no longer open to retail. What would have been ICOs in 2017, or airdrops in 2020, are now ‚Äúinsiders only‚Äù projects who receive funding from VCs and select individuals, with no investment opportunity open to me or you at all. Maybe we‚Äôll be allowed to invest in a year or two at 50x the current price, maybe not, who knows.  The effect either way is that high information retail investors simply aren‚Äôt allowed to profit from learning about exciting projects at the early stages. Meanwhile the dogcoin carnival is open to everyone. It‚Äôs a flagrant waste of money, it‚Äôs not a threat to any vested interests. So much for ‚Äúconsumer protection‚Äù.

The final way in which pressure is applied is through media and reporting.  You want to guarantee that the average person‚Äôs understanding of crypto is *entirely* based around what the Charlatan group is doing, with as little as possible attention going to the Idealists. Every scam, every rugpull, every bridge hack, every ape picture selling for $100,000, is a story you want to maximise.  Go to r/technology and mention crypto and you will be treated a wall of derision, that is all framed in terms of the worst excesses and scams of the space. How many people there know what a zero knowledge proof is, or its implications? How many even understand the principles of verifiability?
It‚Äôs not by accident. The more you maintain the perception that crypto is *all* charlatans, the more you prevent the Idealists from recruiting more technologically competent developers.

So to summarise, Step 1 of the institutional fight against crypto is:

* Squeeze them out of access to tradfi.

* Create a regulatory environment that makes it extremely difficult to be a ‚Äúgood guy‚Äù

* Don‚Äôt let retail make too much money

* Make sure that everyone outside the space is convinced it‚Äôs all a scam.

This, as I said, slows recruitment into the crypto Idealist camp, slows development, and buys you time. Time to build Step 2.

---

So what is Step 2?  Step 2 is the institutions releasing their own version of Web3.  In the coming years we will see massive projects built around *some* of the principles of crypto.  With the entire media apparatus at its back, the public will be presented with a faster, more performant, more composable and cheaper economic apparatus that is based on Distributed Ledger Technology and smart contracts.  Say farewell to the scams of old, bad, crypto, here‚Äôs a version of Web3 provided by the big, high reputation companies that you know and trust.

Flick through some of these:

https://www.vdigitalassetbroker.com/#ecosystem?s=true

https://www.jpmorgan.com/onyx/index

https://r3.com/

https://corda.net/

https://www.swift.com/news-events/news/connecting-digital-islands-paving-way-global-use-cbdcs-and-tokenised-assets

Institutional development of quasi-crypto products is steaming ahead. It‚Äôs worth noting here that many of these entities are actively fudding crypto in the media while building their own parallel solutions.

And I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going out on a limb here to predict that, when these products launch, all of the r/technology ‚Äúskeptics‚Äù will suddenly disappear.  ‚ÄúWhen crypto was a wild, open source community all it built was scams, now that the big players are involved it‚Äôs a different story. Crypto was a scam, but blockchain is the future.‚Äù  I can see it now.

And when these massive products launch, with KYC, with full regulation, and with massive amounts of institutional liquidity, they will play off the perception that they are taking the Web3 dream forward. That rather than dying, crypto finally ‚Äúwent legit‚Äù.

But what will actually happen? They will still have their hands on all the levers.  They will be able to devise the new system however they like, and do you think they will want 100% accountability? Do you think they will want maximum decentralisation and giving power back to regular people as network participants? Do you think they will want a ruleset that massively constrains the most powerful players, which are themselves?  Do you think they will want a system where literally anyone can verify that they are playing by the rules?

Or do you think they will just release a faster, shinier version of the current system, that has been used with great effect over the last 50 years to funnel money from the average person into their own pockets?

And so it will be with great celebration and fanfare that crypto will ‚Äúdie‚Äù, while all the headlines are saying that it has succeeded, that it has been adopted, that it has finally gone global.

So what will happen to the Idealists? They will still exist, but with constant anti-competitive pressure they will be pushed to the sidelines.  They will be treated as a humorous niche of nerds, the Linux enthusiasts of Web3, who are all mired in the ideological technical stuff, but nothing a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù person would be interested in.  And like this the average person will never know what they lost out on, never know what real chance for fundamental change was squandered.

  There‚Äôs a talk I saw about a year ago that I wish I could find.  It was from a central banking executive with a Korean name and a perfect Oxbridge accent, and if anyone could find it I would be immensely grateful.

The talk was about 20 minutes long.  In the first 10 minutes he talked about how terrible crypto was, with much laughter from the audience.  In the following 10 minutes he described all the exciting new functionalities of CBDCs; Tokenised assets, smart contracts, guaranteed execution, atomic swaps.  Literally all concepts that were born and developed in the crucible of open source crypto. That talk summed up the whole conflict. They will try and kill the dream, and then take credit for everything it invented.

It‚Äôs hard not to be cynical. It would feel disingenuous to finish up with an exhortation to ‚Äújoin the Idealists and we will win!‚Äù Because honestly, I don‚Äôt think we will.  The amount you need to know to really see the fundamental world-changing value in disintermediated systems is too high, and many of the devs themselves who were previously in the idealist camp have already followed the glowing path of money across the bridge to the institutional side. The institutions are simply so much more powerful than the dreamers.
But just because it‚Äôs a lost cause, doesn‚Äôt mean people shouldn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on. And it certainly doesn‚Äôt mean that they shouldn‚Äôt be mad about it."
4/3/23,The SEC vs. Ripple case is the primary focus of the crypto community and it's a big deal. Judge Questions SEC.,"# Judge's Comments in Voyager/Binance.US Deal.

The SEC vs. Ripple is a significant case in the crypto world, and if you're not familiar with it, it's crucial to pay attention. The reason being that legal professionals and industry experts speculate that the court's ruling may establish a precedent for the entire cryptocurrency market by deciding if a cryptocurrency qualifies as a security, either in part or whole.

The remarks made in another cryptocurrency court case involving the sale of Voyager's ($VGX) to Binance.US have not received much attention, but they are highly significant.

Last month, the SEC filed a limited objection to the Voyager-Binance.US deal, citing legal violations. Other state regulatory agencies are also involved in their objections.

According to Reuters, the SEC has objected to the Voyager-Binance.US deal and is investigating whether Voyager's crypto lending business sold unregistered securities. The regulatory agency has expressed concerns in court filings that Voyager has failed to demonstrate compliance with US securities law in the Binance deal and other cryptocurrency transactions.

Judge Wiles inquired whether the sale of Voyager to Binance.US had infringed securities laws.

At this point, the situation becomes interesting. The SEC's attorney responds, ""**We cannot take a position at this point**. The SEC is a deliberative body, and its process is a non-public one by federal law.""

The judge expressed his dissatisfaction with the SEC's attorney's response.

>*‚ÄúDeliberative is one thing, but what have you done? If there are reasons to be concerned here, I need to hear specifics.‚Äù*

According to a popular Voyager investor/hodler, Judge Wiles' comments to the SEC were summarized as follows:

>""You're asking the debtor to prove that the cryptos being transacted are not securities, **but you've given no regulatory guide as to what that is**.""

The recent comments from the SEC attorney and Judge Wiles are gaining more attention, and their potential impact on the SEC vs. Ripple case is being discussed.  Why? Crypto advocates think that the SEC's decision to not take a stance and the judge's statement about the lack of regulatory guidance could strengthen Ripple's case and potentially halt the SEC's perceived campaign against cryptocurrency."

4/3/23,"After creating a new crypto wallet, always test the recovery process first!","This is a little trick that every crypto investor should know and can prevent some serious financial damage or headache later.

After you created a new crypto wallet, your first step is obviously writing down the recovery phrase. Now instead of using the wallet, write down the first address the wallet gives you for receiving crypto. This address can be stored in a text file or note.

**Now delete the wallet!** Many wallets allow you just to do it, some might need to reinstall the app. Then instead of creating a new wallet, use your secret recovery phrase to recover the one you just created. If the seed is valid, also check if you get the same address as earlier? Only if the addresses match you can be 100% sure recovery worked and your note included everything you need for recovery.

This little test will reveal anything you might overlook - not only writing/order mistakes, but also details you might miss. For example first-time XMR users would also notice they should write down the date or block height when their wallet was created (for faster recovery later).

&#x200B;

Also important to know: If you made a mistake while writing down your seed, your funds are 99% not lost. The note can still be used to recover your wallet by brute force with special tools because the entropy for mistakes is very low. But by following this one simple rule you will never get into this situation.

One more side note: Some wallets (including Trezor and Ledger) allow you to test the recovery phrase without deleting your wallet - but if your wallet is still empty, you can as well wipe it to be 100% sure."
4/3/23,"Binance's response to allegations of misappropriating user funds is hugely disappointing, hugely frightening or both","For the uninitiated, Binance are facing allegations regarding collateral that was meant to back user funds to the amount of $1.8 Billion. It mainly affects USDC collateral and a derivative of USDC. The sum of money was sent last year to various entities of which most were hedge funds but also included SBF's Alameda Research and Tron founder Justin Sun.

CoinArgos states the collateral meant to back the Binance-Peg USDC was deficient by more than $1 billion *on three separate occasions* in the peg  wallet, and the exchange‚Äôs version of its BUSD stablecoin was undercollateralized by more than $500 million for the *majority of 2021*.

Basically, customer funds that were supposed to be backed, were not as the collateral was sent to a number of entities as mentioned above. Meaning that your supposed $1 worth of stablecoin, probably wasn't worth even close to that, and a market fluctuation could send it the same way Terra USD(and Luna) went. The allegations are bad but frankly, the worst part was Binance's response to all this.  

Binance‚Äôs chief strategy officer, Patrick Hillmann, was interviewed and he explained away the concerns by simply stating basically that the ""real"" accounting took place off-chain and the on-chain wallets are merely ""containers"" for the funds. This, while likely non-ideal at least for customers, is certainly possibly as access to the wallets itself, if that is even necessary and it might not be, can be passed around whether through keys or otherwise.

However, Binance CEO CZ himself came out dismissing everything as ""FUD"" and claimed that the activities were only ‚Äúinternal rebalancing‚Äù and also characterized them as ‚Äúsome old blockchain transactions that our clients have done.‚Äù It is hugely suspect that these two executives can't seem to keep a coherent story. Also, as the CEO, you would think someone in that position would give something more concrete as the classic response of a crypto degen to any concerns or criticism. In another view, the situation also smells somewhat FTX-like, such that collateral for customer funds, essentially customer funds themselves are being used without customer notice for the profit of the exchange.  And that is looking past the also questionable fact of links to Alameda and Justin Sun.

Granted, I don't expect Binance to fail like FTX because of its humongous size and diverse range of customers, but it is not reassuring on any level to customers.

4/3/23,DCA what you can afford and do not get discouraged!,"DCA what you can afford and do not get discouraged!

A little while ago I made a post saying in order to get rich in crypto you need to start rich. While there is still truth to that, there is a big difference between getting filthy rich like we dream of (not really realistic) and making some good money that could better your life (very possible) 

All the time in this sub you were see the term DCA or dollar cost average. In simple terms that just means invest what you can afford to in projects you believe in. If you bought high, continue to buy to bring that cost down. If the price is low and you believe it will increase then perfect, keep loading up while its cheap. 

If DCA'ing to you means 5, 10, 20 bucks a week or even a month then perfect, that is awesome! You are actively investing in your future financial situation which is fantastic! Don't get discouraged when you see people posting or commenting about dropping hundreds or thousands of dollars on something. I mean good for them but that isnt you.

Just remember to make an investment decision that is right for you and don't worry about how much other people can afford to invest. Focus on you! 

Best of luck everyone."

Stopped caring about crypto for a while, said for a change. Because it's becoming really unhealthy checking charts all the time. Just came back last month to test moons dist and and left again then back two weeks ago because of a friend.

Well, last time I checked in in here. There were some people who were influencers to me buying a coin - one of them was ERGO which I don't know what the current situation of that now. Much to my knowledge some those were shillers.

Well, in principle AA meetings provide a safe environment where you can share your story and get support from your peers. But we all know that this will probably not happen here. But I'm sure you will learn that others have done worse than you. 

I will start, let's keep it short.

I took an online course on trading, aka drawing lines on charts. After that the worst happened, I earned some money doing this for a couple of times and this made my dopamine go through the roofs. So I put more money cuz I thought I was the best and ended up losing a couple grand, luckily after that I stopped and went to cry to my bed.

After that I thought I could get my money back by *investing* in a memecoin of a memecoin (it sounds so bad at the time of writing xd) and lost more.

You know this, but nobody shares how.

Research is my job so I'm happy to share with you the only technique you require to unlock the data you need.

Effective research uncovers your best opportunities early. But Crypto grows too fast for common techniques.

**Search Listening** is the first research technique I use with every work assignment. This advanced method is simple to apply and offers extraordinary insights.

Search Listening:

* Is a form of mind-reading
* Reveals real-time sentiment & narrative
* Generates new ideas

It tells you what people think about markets, projects...anything really. All with remarkable accuracy.

&#x200B;

**HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?**

We showcase the best of ourselves on Twitter & Instagram. But we share our needs, anxieties, and opinions with Google. You share things with Google you don't tell anyone else.

Your questions, opinions, & statements are collected, sorted, bundled, & shared.

**DON'T STUDY THE DATA; SEE IT**

We think & reason with inner voice. Language being its expression.

But we seldom stop to consider the limitations.

Language enabled us to express, shape, and refine our thoughtS. But we grew complacent with this set-up. So now, language is our brain's operating system. Like Windows 95.

Your cognitive capacity is limited by the mechanics of language. In our case, the rules that govern English shape much of our thinking. Most of us aren't even aware of its influence.

New language learners regularly report expanded mental capacity. They *see* new perspectives.

Data often yields additional insights with proper mapping. It takes on a performative function. You don't need to study it. The structure enables you to see it & immediately understood.

4/3/23,How do you track your crypto?,"each year keeping track of my portfolio gets more and more complex. i use coinstats on my phones to be able to take a quick glance on where i am in regards to gains/losses but with staking and swapping things get ugly. 

also have an excel spreadsheet that i use for just basic buys/sells/transfers and then koinly for tax crap/reports.

today i swapped some crypto and was updating my app and spreadsheets and realized‚Ä¶ this shit is complex and sucks to try to keep a heads up on. in a way keeping track of things made me realize that my tiny gains if any may not be worth all of the effort involved so i may just consolidate my portfolio into some top ten coins/tokens and play the super long game.  koinly helps but still needs a lot of babysitting depending on if things are on an exchange or on wallets. my cost basis in the coinstats app got all jacked up and now i need to go back and resetup all my coins/tokens in it. uggh. 

so‚Ä¶. how do you keep track of your holdings? has tracking them made you reconsider having a bigger/diverse portfolio?

I feel like bear markets are way more comfortable to trade in than bull markets.

My main reason for that is that I had no buy pressure for this whole bear market as I knew that buying at $22k or $15k wont make much of a difference in a decade or so as both of these price levels will just seem very low anyway.

This would be a very good chart to showcase that as it shows how especially during this bear market we hit a new ATH in long-term holders. Long-term holders that stay during a bear market will also just have it a lot easier during the next bull market and possibly make way more profits than new people just FOMOing in.

During the last bull market I think we all kind of had a fear to not miss out somewhere and were furiously in front of charts to not miss anything. Now its way more chill as we can buy mostly anytime and have nothing we could miss out on. Just my thoughts here, let me hear about your:"

I have done terrible mistakes, like most newbies basically, but my biggest was building an all-alts portfolio and holding it during the bear. 

I learned a lot from my mistakes. For instance, I started taking profits already from my bear market investments, and accumulating BTC and ETH aggressively during dips instead of shitcoins.

However, I still feel like the degen in me is still alive and waiting for the bullmarket to screw me up. No matter how hard I try to do the right things, I sometimes slip and fuck it up. For example, I'm holding into some highly speculative alts rn that I could have sold for a decent profit a week ago, and I'm currently at a loss.

The fact that I might have a chance of 10xing my money, or if bch goes back to it‚Äôs ath, I‚Äôll 25x my money.

And just because a coin is top 10 doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs ‚Äúsafe.‚Äù

The only 2 safe coins are ETH and BTC imo. These coins have been here for so long. And ETH and has much room to grow, and has proven it has!

Im never buying Alts again, now what about the real unknown coins, the shitcoins the potential 1000x? Never again, I bought Acs, Vra, cake, csix, and more. And they keep going down, it‚Äôs a sneaky scheme.

4/3/23,"My partner works in the asylum seeker/refugee sector and deals with displaced people every day, CBDCs and decentralised finance/crypto are going to have inconceivably enormous impacts on these people's lives","*\*edit\* some people reading this have missed that I'm saying CBDCs are literally going to kill people, they're life changing in a very bad way.*

Preface - I'm based in Australia and my partner works with displaced people from various countries around the world, many of whom are either fleeing persecution due to their race or sexuality, or who were deemed political dissidents.

I know this board usually focuses on price action, but cryptocurrencies and CBDCs are now major factors in the ongoing freedom and survival of refugees across the world.

Many asylum seekers who come to Australia arrive by boat, they pay people smugglers and risk it all getting here. Because they're unbanked they'll usually sell all their assets and try to bring it across physically. Historically this has been in things like gold, but as you can imagine during the trip here their possessions are often extorted out of them or stolen. Being able to store their money in a string of words they've memorised, rather than a physical possession, is life changing.

In Iran as an example cryptocurrency is beginning to boom, they've previously dealt with black market USD and that makes up most of the day to day transactions there since the currency is debased. When my partner last traveled there BTC was already becoming common place, and this was back in 2018.

On the other side of the coin CBDCs are the single biggest threat to political dissidents and persecuted people we've lived through. Governments can track and limit the transactions of individuals who are perceived as any kind of threat, and this includes their friend and family networks. If nobody will transact with you can't even pay the people smugglers you need to get you across the border.

Crypto is the only thing that's going to protect these groups from the encroaching wave of CBDCs. This is why it's important to also have decentralised stable coins and KYC free DEX's as an option, the ability to transact on these networks is life or death for millions of people and must be protected."
4/3/23,Every small drop in price isn't supposed to have a reason,"Yes, market *is* volatile to news, and news do influence the prices a lot, but it's in vain trying to guess why the price has dropped.




Just because the price has went down a little today does not mean that everyone's panicking and selling everything or that there's some information that we don't know about and should be alarmed. It doesn't have to die for it to drop a little in price. 



Sometimes the market just acts like the market does because there's a lot of people buying and selling and not every time there's a reason. People always try to guess the reason and look into every drop of price, but sometimes there's just none. 



The fact that people think these news control the price is actually what controls the price. Had people not thought that others would sell because of the news, they wouldn't have neither and it wouldn't have changed at all.

I learned I could stake, yield farm, lend, borrow and do all these cool things without having to ask anyone for permission. I didn't need to fill out an application. Talk to an human. Sign a paper. Submit my ID. Show my race, language, country of origin, sex or provide my voice or credit score. I was fascinated and hooked instantly. I am never going back and never asking anyone for permission to use anything remotely similar ever again.

So what about you guys? What is the absolute one thing that you are enamored with about crypto? No wrong answers. It can be anything. Just trying to get some true and honest thoughts from the community members. 

Thanks for your time and for sharing."

* If it sounds too good to be true specially in crypto, when they start telling you guaranteed returns, schemes that makes you rich fast

* A dedicated crypto computer to use if for only crypto, don‚Äôt use it for anything else ( just connecting your hardware wallet and accessing exchanges ), that will reduce getting malware‚Äôs on your computer

If crypto doesn‚Äôt decrease in volatility I just don‚Äôt see crypto being used as a main stream currency. I just feel like paying with fait and stable coins would be better for both parties.

4/3/23,I have played Sorare for 18 months and I bring you my player perspective on this Sports Fantasy NFTs game.,"As a fan of soccer and fantasy football, I decided to start my journey on Sorare 18 months ago.

# Overview ‚öΩüèÄ‚öæ

**Sorare:** is, it is a global sports game and entertainment platform where you can buy, sell, and trade digital player cards (NFTs) to use in games.

**Sports fantasy games:** it is basically lining up players who, depending on their real-life performance, earn points that can be used to obtain ETH or new cards.

When I first joined, there were only a few football tournaments, and the game looked a bit new. Over time, Sorare has been adding different tournaments and sports such as NBA and MLB and become one of the most important Sport Fantasy NFTs place.

# Cards and prices üé¥üí∞

There are four (4) levels of Scarcity for Sorare NFTs which you can buy, sell, win, or trade:

* **‚¨õ¬†Unique** (1 per player per season - this is the only card of its kind in the world)
* **üü¶ Super Rare** (10 per player per season)
* **üü•¬†Rare** (100 per player per season)
* **üü®¬† Limited** (1000 per player per season)

[Cards Scarcity](https://preview.redd.it/8vhgv5c9drla1.png?width=890&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=878f5cdd523acd84b90ef2a53f94588a7091d264)

These types of cards can participate in different competitions depending the type and competition type. For now, I only play in Limited since the others are out of my budget.

Card prices have fallen as well as the hype of the NFTs and crypto.

For example, depending the league you can make a team that can compete for prizes for $100-200. Goalkeepers are the most expensive players since there are fewer of them that play matches.

# Tournaments ‚öΩ

As for tournaments, there is a wide variety of tournaments depending on the region, and there are also free card tournaments where you can win prizes.

In the following picture, you can see all the Limited tournaments I can sign up for and also the top 5 tournaments that are free to play. If you are new, I recommend playing these free tournaments before starting to build your teams to get used to the game.

[This weekend tournaments I can participate according to my cards](https://preview.redd.it/z0qi3egpbrla1.png?width=859&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b3735ab25615f114d043907fbd1c4ea1d2f65b1e)

This is how it looks a lineup for a tournament which have different rules for each sport and tournament.

[Just a line up summary](https://preview.redd.it/qjxw3d88crla1.png?width=3070&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b08d1e5b05a8a9cbb5ab910f01920782c1a9cb0e)

# Prizes üèÜ

Prizes usually vary depending on the number of players, matches, and competitions in which you participate. They are not bad, and you can earn some money and cards. Here you can see the current prizes for one of the Limited competitions:""

[Prizes for Champion Europe - Limited](https://preview.redd.it/20gp8jxjbrla1.png?width=1221&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=734d4c3528892e67e8abd1b78e4e42547639b0bc)

# Performance and journey üöÄ

I started off as a great investor, buying NFTs at all-time highs without doing enough DYOR, and ended up making quite a few mistakes until I learned how the market and the game worked.

I think that you can make money if you spend a lot of time researching and have some luck, but regarding game prizes, you need to be really lucky and know what you are doing to get good prizes, although it is not impossible.

Once, I won $250 worth of ETH and a card worth $300 ETH when I achieved second position in the Asian league. This was the winning team, and I felt so proud.

Usually I use to get 1-2 Limited cards of the Tier 3 with worth like $3 ETH or something like that but sometimes depending their performance you can make some money too.

[My best lineup prize ever](https://preview.redd.it/dhnj6wlacrla1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a7765facdc74c41bcaf5dd4aa3d127efd68960ba)

# Do Your Own Research (DYOR) üîç

To decide which players but you have to DYOR a lot so it is important to have the best sources. I use the following websites to scout players:

* [https://sorarebase.football/](https://sorarebase.football/)
* [https://www.soraredata.com/](https://www.soraredata.com/)

# Personal point of view üí¨

I would recommend Sorare to real fantasy sports fans but always starting playing the free to play tournaments but I won't recommend it to people that wants to make money and have fun at the same time. You can also try to make a profit just as a trader but I think it is an slow profit strategy and it summarizes into luck and DYOR.

# Closing Remarks üí≠

I hope that my perspective from inside the Sorare game has helped you learn and to decide if you were thinking of playing it or not.

4/3/23,Protect Your Coins: Basic Ways To Safeguard Your Seed Phrase From Malefactors And Yourself,"As we have observed, there are new members on this crypto sub who have created their Reddit wallets and may not know how to protect their seed phrase correctly. I have created this post to help new members safely store their seed phrases and also serve as a reminder for old members to revisit the basics. 

# Seed Phrase üîë

A seed phrase is the key to your crypto wallet, and if you lose it or it falls into the wrong hands, you will lose all your coins. Here are some tips to protect your seed phrase: 

# Things to do ‚úÖ

**Write it down and keep it in a safe place:** The most common way to save it is to write it down on a piece of paper or notebook and keep it in a secure location.

[Notebook with a seed phrase](https://preview.redd.it/3dzrcnlm2sla1.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c4bd41fd624ac41c1b475d6777efcf0d857b0f06)

**Upgrade - Use a metal plate to save your seed phrase:**  Paper is not resistant to water and fire. It may seem silly, but accidents can happen, and it's better to be safe than sorry. To protect your seed phrase, you can stamp it onto a metal plate. 

[Metal plate with a seed phrase](https://preview.redd.it/iuoe5yof2sla1.jpg?width=350&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e848a4326015124b7359ce2a4dce79e3580e03d5)

**Store it offline:** NEVER keep your seed phrase on your computer or phone. Store it offline on a USB drive or hardware wallet.

[Hardware Wallets](https://preview.redd.it/9r1sc3fz2sla1.jpg?width=329&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e7cc0d8b06b40ba62c33d190084b2feabbf31b71)

# Things NOT to do ‚ùå

**Don't store it digitally**: NEVER store your seed phrase in digital format, such as a file on your computer or an email. If your computer or phone gets hacked, your seed phrase could be compromised. 

**Don't share it with anyone:** This may seem obvious, but do NOT share your seed phrase with anyone. When it comes to money, trust no one, not even your best friend or family. 

[After realizing that his seed phrase has been compromised](https://preview.redd.it/v8jvj1mr3sla1.png?width=242&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bb1c5fb6c602db8a6dae5ba3d0df7b8f2f7de8c1)

# Conclusion

Remember, protecting your seed phrase is one of the most important steps for keeping your investments safe. Also remember that Exchanges are not safe and self custody is a must too.

The game uses blockchain technology to ensure that all players and teams are unique and can't be duplicated. The game has attracted a lot of attention from soccer fans and investors alike.

There is another game I wanted to add but it is not allowed to be written about, pretty much its an MMO and any NFT project can be integrated into the game as a playable character. Super cool idea and I think it has the potential to make real use cases for pretty much any NFT that is just a ""Jpeg."""

4/3/23,Moon Market Cap Compared To Other Coins," 

There have been a lot of exciting developments with our beloved Moons over the past few months, and the market cap has grown because of that; however, Moons, still have tremendous room to grow.

Here is where Moons currently stand:

&#x200B;

| Coin | Market Cap | Moon price with market cap increase | Price increase from current |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| Moon | $20.8 | $.195 | 1X |

 Here is some data to compare Moons to other coins if Moons get their market cap:

&#x200B;

| BabyDogeCoin | $410 million | $3.84 | 19.74X |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| Bitcoin SV | $731 million | $6.85 | 35.21X |
| ApeCoin | $1.7 billion | $16.27 | 83.65X |
| Ethereum Classic | $2.8 billion | $25.95 | 133X |
| Shibu Inu | $6.5 billion | $61.28 | 315X |
| DogeCoin | $10.4 billion | $97.12 | 499X |
| XRP | $19.1 billion | $178.45 | 917X |
|BNB| $45.6 billion | $427.15 | 2,195X |
| Ethereum | $188 billion | $1,759 | 9,041X |
| Bitcoin | $429 billion | $4,017 | 20,645X |

4/3/23,Power of average retail investors,"Objectively/Statistically speaking, do average retail investors, as a group, have any influence/power on market at all? like if we hear about some coin, that it has ""increased interest from retail investors"" does that matter? I mean sure it will cause some price increase but will it be any meaningful price increase? or is it really institutional investors and whales ""playground"" at all times? 

On one hand I kinda believe a bit because I find it hard that institutional investors would FOMO when price has already gone up 5x+ so it mostly would be retail but on the other hand I'm not even sure if institutional investors and whales are immune to FOMO"
4/3/23,"Every time you think a certain coin won't fall out of Top 10, take a look at all the coins that has fallen out of that list in the last decade","No coin is really immune to dying and being forgotten forever, even though it might seem like ""It's too big to die"". Be it Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any other coin that people have accepted as the top Cryptos which won't go away.



Every time you see certain and think it won't die because it's too big, and that it's a good investment, you can take a look at all the coins that people thought wouldn't fall out of top 10 and now no one really remembers.



This was the Top 10 list in 2014:


- 1 - BTC

- 2 - LTC

- 3 - XRP

- 4 - PPC

- 5 - NXT

- 6 - OMNI

- 7 - DOGE

- 8 - NMC

- 9 - QRK

- 10 - PTS


Only 3 of these are still in top 10, and Doge even though one of them, is too much down from its ATH and is on its way to falling out of it.

4/3/23,"PSA: the most defining aspect of Cryptocurrency, and it‚Äôs effect on the human psyche","‚Ä¶ Is it‚Äôs volatility, but that is expected this early in the game. So why do so many get so emotional when price fluctuates ? 

For a number of reasons.. Excitement, anticipation, stress.. Etc. and these are generally caused by high levels of cortisol. This causes people to scream at the slightest of price movements, in either direction. Claiming bear/bull market, FOMO etc. 

Quite frankly, this isn‚Äôt doing our space any justice. Not only that but it makes potential investors skeptical because half the time we look like a district of cults and lunatics. 

It would serve us very well, help adoption rates AND the longevity of our life‚Äôs if we could manage our emotions better.

But how do we do that ? We reduce our cortisol levels ! The stress juice as I like to call it. When these levels are high for prolonged time periods it can lead to but not limited to:

-Anxiety
-Depression
-Digestive problems
-Headaches
-Muscle tension and pain
-Heart disease, heart attack, high -blood pressure and stroke
-Sleep problems
-Weight gain
-Memory and concentration impairment

Very not-good things that I‚Äôm sure half of you already experience, to some degree. Here are some things that can help reduce cortisol levels. 

-Eating a healthy diet, regular exercise 
getting plenty of sleep

-Practicing relaxation techniques such as yoga, deep breathing, massage or meditation

-Keeping a journal and writing about your thoughts or what you're grateful for in your life

-Taking time for hobbies friends and family(only if they are not toxic)

-Laugh, plan and organize your goals, help out in your community, it‚Äôs good for the soul. 

And above all else, take care of yourself first. ‚Äúwing and a prayer‚Äù investing ends terribly long term and can be detrimental to your mental health.

To what extent will you defend a project? Is there anything that would ever turn you away from it? 



**Terra Luna:**


February 22nd of last year, Luna Foundation Guard raises $1 billion through the sale of LUNA tokens to buy BTC for UST‚Äôs reserve system, with Jump Crypto and Three Arrows Capital being the lead investors.


Fast forward to May 7th, the price of the then $18-billion algorithmic stablecoin UST started to falter and fell to 35 cents on May 9th. Its companion token, Luna, which was meant to stabilize UST's price, fell from $80 to a few cents by May 12th. Luna Foundation Guard confirmed it depleted its BTC reserves from around 80,000 to 313 BTC during the attempt to save UST‚Äôs peg. Leading to an estimated $60 billion wipeout. This hasn‚Äôt stopped the fanatics from coming out. Their sub is still active and is oddly enthusiastic considering not even a year ago people were contemplating ending their own lives after getting financially obliterated.


**Solana:**


According to user Money_Reach. Solana has gone down 10 times. The information is in their post so there‚Äôs not much to say. But still, people defend Solana in this sub as if their lives depend on it while conveniently never addressing the outages. The usual retort I‚Äôve seen is ‚Äúalways do the opposite of what this sub says‚Äù 


> https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/11d6klr/solana_has_gone_down_10_times_now/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf


The update that caused the most recent outage ran on testnet as the majority version for a decent number of epochs, then it was added to mainnet slowly, first target was 5%, then 30%, and after a few epochs it was given the green light for all validators. Once it hit 66% of active stake using that version, problems arose and the network was down.


**Harmony:**


Using Horizon Bridge, if a user wants to send an asset from Ethereum to Harmony, it will start with the Ethereum asset entering the bridge. Which will then lock the Ethereum version of the asset in the bridge. The validators of the bridge confirm the ERC-20 is locked, and then have Harmony mint its own version of the same asset in the form of HRC-20. This HRC-20 token can then be used freely in the Harmony ecosystem while the ERC-20 representation remains locked. The ERC-20 is not burned, and if unlocked by a hacker, would still be able to be used.


To keep the bridge safe, Harmony used off-chain multi-sig wallet. This multi-sig wallet requires the use of multiple signatures to complete the desired action. If the multi-sig becomes compromised, the hacker takes control of the bridge. The Horizon bridge had 4 addresses connected to the multi-sig, with 2 signatures being required to complete an action. 


The hacker was able to take control of 2 of the signatures and therefore control the bridge. In 18 minutes they completed 11 transactions, freeing the ERC-20 tokens that were locked on the bridge. Once unlocked, the hacker sent the assets to their own wallet. Getting away with 100 million in assets. Mind you, the hack started January 13th of last year but the activity wasn‚Äôt reported until 3 days later. It was supposedly confirmed through a that North Korea‚Äôs Lazarus Group and APT38 were behind the hack. 


**TL;DR** Luna, Sol, and One all went through events that you‚Äôd think would turn investors away but that doesn‚Äôt seem to be the case. I think nothing short of a delisting can stop us. If Bitconnect could be traded on Coinbase right now it would pump 60%."

I would like to see the price of the crypto I‚Äôve bought at that moment somewhere in the transaction or near that, just to know if is going good or bad and take relative action.

Nonetheless, since it appears this feature is rare my doubt is now if that‚Äôs not possibile due to how the chain is configured, is that a thing?

In the end, the % growth or loss is based on time, not on the price at which I‚Äôve bought, so I don‚Äôt have any means to control if I have Gained or loss.

Thank you so much in advance guys,

4/3/23,Recent Data Showed That ETH‚Äôs Exchange Supply Is at 5-Year Low By CoinEdition,
4/3/23,"If everyone believes in halving, then halving will not make you rich",">To readers in 2025 and beyond: at the time of this post, 1 year before the March 2024 halving, investors generally believed that the 2024 halving event would cause the price of Bitcoin to go parabolic.

If all investors believed in the power of the halving, they would have already invested all of their money before the event. This means there would be little new demand for Bitcoin from existing investors after the halving. The pace of new investors joining will be the major factor tipping the balance between supply and demand.  The change in mining output, however, would have less of an impact on the price.

Let me ask: Will new investors be more likely to invest before or after the halving? I would say there is no reason for new investors to prefer joining after the halving and it is a minor factor. New investors decision is based on the amount of money they have, inflationary stress and most importantly, the past performance of Bitcoin. If this year's Bitcoin performance is down, by March 2024, the ""past performance"" (i.e. today's performance) will not look good, so there is even less reason to buy the dips today.

The winner could be those who actually bought the dip after the halving in March 2024, as demand slowly creeps back. At that time (exactly 1 year later), few will chant ""buy the dip""."
4/3/23,Ripple CEO Warns Looming XRP Lawsuit Ruling Will Have ‚ÄòPivotal‚Äô Implications for Crypto if SEC Wins,
4/3/23,"With some patience, it's actually easy to make money in Crypto.","People do complain a lot about how it's hard to make money in Crypto and all that. Most who think this way are either very new to it or haven't ever had the patience to actually invest in a good coin and wait. It really is as simple as that, you don't have to be engaged in it every day of your life.




Yes, Bitcoin might have fallen a lot in the last year, but it was less than 10c when it began. All you had to do was to invest and only be patience enough to see actual returns on your investment.




When you keep checking the prices everyday and engage in it actively, that goes against what investing really is.


But of course, you do have to choose the right coin. Investing and patience won't work if you've invested in a meme coin or anything of the sort, which will only put you back in the investment game.


Bitcoin and Ethereum are two coins right now that can really stand their ground and all the other alts seem scary to me. Paying attention to every news certainly doesn't help. 

Instead of complaining, I urge you to have some patience with the market as the amount of people in Crypto is increasing which does make returns take longer. But it pays off eventually."
4/3/23,This sub seems to have the bad habit to give irrelevant or ‚Äúdying‚Äú things even more attention and thus reviving them.,"Just something that I was able to observe over the past weeks and possibly months is that obviously this sub has a bit of a hatred for certain things and often that hatred is even justified as those persons/Cryptos are actually either complete scams or just not relevant anymore.

It is normal that we then would comment or post about them a bit. But this sub sometimes takes things a bit too far. On recent examples of Jim Cramer and Solana, we can see that. Especially SOL gets often coined as ‚Äúscam‚Äú and ‚Äúdying coin‚Äú but then we are get multiple posts on why SOL is a scam. Most of them have the same topics and just some have a more elaborate analysis and arguments.

4/3/23,The argument for cardano 2023-2025 - and a bit of history,"I know, I know - /CC is an ETH sub. 
The reason I am writing this at 1am is because I think for the most part, Crypto is becoming more siloed over time. People dont try new protocols, they might buy the tokens or they might invest, but they dont really try to experience the ecosystem as it stands. Cardano for many years didnt do much... but that has changed, and I think it is pretty clear now to anyone keeping up with all the popular protocols, that Cardano has passed ETH in development and vision. 


And since all the moonboys lost their money, perhaps it is time to now begin to discuss in real terms what cardano is bringing to the party in its latest upgrades and iterations. 

but first a bit of history - If you arent aware of the cardano roadmap then welcome to the club, Cardano more or less abandoned the concept of a roadmap in about 2019 after we all learned that this whole crypto thing is harder than expected. 
What they moved back to was the original outline, a 5 phase plan to create a new global financial infrasctucture package, and no more hard deadlines.

1 . Byron 2017: This was the original launch of the network and had really no more functionality than dogecoin does today, send and receive on an EUTXO platform. 1 tps and even then it was often 0.7 tps. although it was technically proof of stake, all the nodes were controlled by the IOHK development team.

It launched in a bull run and shot up to about 80c (30 billion dollar market cap) before people even knew what cardano was.

This was the state of cardano until 2020. and in this time cardano got a pretty poor reputation of being a ghost chain, vaporware and all the fun things that the BTC and ETH maxis would yell across the internet at anything that wasnt their main bag. Most of the arguments were founded in the fact that cardano had been developing since 2015 - and had no interesting functionality, had missed all their roadmap deadlines and Charles Hoskinson was a polarising character on twitter, sparring with people like Justin Sun and Vitalik on what crypto should be.

In 2019-2020 the cardano team completely rewrote the whole cardano infrastructure in what was known as the Byron Reboot. why? because they didn't like how it worked, and they wanted to get it right before moving on to the next 4 steps... and fuck the road map. there is a lot of shit here about implementation of formal methods and comp-sci stuff I don't understand, other than it was going to be slow to develop - but good. I personally have always been in the camp of 'do it right the first time'.

In this time they also developed the Hardfork combinator, Which is one of the most outrageous pieces of software ever created. it allows for the cardano network to upgrade the whole protocol with new functionality, while still having backwards compatability for all the old wallets, and every old feature that has existed. No more BSV BCH BTD BTG or ETC everytime the community had an argument. When you look at all the issues that ETH had moving to POS, and BTC had trying to implement lightning, Cardano's solution was simply beautiful and painless.

2 . Shelley: in 2020 they used the HFC to launch staking and Decentralisation finally arrived. anyone who wanted to run a stake pool, could. anyone who wanted to delegate to that pool, could. no locking up of tokens, no handing over custodity, no limtations - a feature that ETH just delayed again. Byron wallets are still around and functioning today - in fact many exchanges still use them.

This staking mechanism allowed for ISPOs to rise up (initial stake pool offering). if you had an idea and wanted to fund it, people could simply stake to your pool, and get rewarded with tokens for your project. you keep the ADA, they get the tokens you minted for basically free.  Tokens on cardano are treated equal to ADA, as Native Assets, and the fees to move them about are the same 0.17 ADA that it has been from the start.  some of these went well.....some failed miserably - such is life in the tech world.


3 . Gougen: smart contracts finally arrived in 2021; a full 6 years behind ETHs own smart contract system.  IOHK created several different languages, Marlowe, Plutus, and a few new interesting protocols like Iele (which never worked and never hit mainnet). 
But these languages were by modern standards hard to use and they were slow to develop....BUT they were good. no one on cardano talks about hacks, or leaks, or breaches, or contract bugs or points of vulnerability - because apart from a few that were caught before implementation...there has only been one - due to exposure to the Solana hack.

4 and 5 are still being developed. That is Basho with scalability and governance with Voltaire. 


**SO What does cardano look like now?** 

Well it has AMM dexes accessable directly in the wallet to swap tokens without going to said dex. 

It has dex agrigators so you can get the best price and liquidity across the whole market of all the dexes without shopping around - all within your wallet. 

The wallet connection to Dapps is seamless and secure. 

It has all the usual NFTs and tokens anyone could ever want, with cheap minting fees, minimal congestion due the the First Come First Served system. But they seem to be a little better. NFTs can have automatic royalty payments to the creator, ADA locked into smart contracts can still be staked, reward tokens can be redeemed with no fuss...  and fees are always known before sending, and usually always the same 0.17xxx.

It has a billion dollar treasury system to fund new projects voted on by the community by weight of their stake. 1 ADA = 1 vote. Within this system known as Catalyst, there is a hierarchy of users who review and screen proposals before the community vote -  and are rewarded for their efforts in ADA.

AND it doesnt have a single L2 to make any of this possible. all of this is still running on the core protocol and the community is waiting for the implementation of Hydra - the scaling solution 

The Big argument within the cardano space at the moment is around Contingent staking - whether we allow stakepool operators to deny delegators  based on a variety of factors so that those stake pools can meet the KYC or money and tax regulations within the country that they operate.  A stakepool was designed to be a business, and as such a business should reserve the right to refuse service.

But does that not also fly in the face of the crypto utopia that we have been striving for? will that not lead to a china-esque surveillance state?....probably not....but it might give an authoritarian state the tools to implement one with much lower effort.  

Cardano is also finalising the governance voting structure for the protocol. If the community dont want CH and IOHK in charge anymore, well we can ellect a different dev team to manage the protocol - on chain, without KYC. 
Do we want a new feature? well now we can all vote on that feature.
Do we want to change the fee structure? vote!
Do we want to change the protocol so token burning can occur? VOTE!

Do you not have enough time to bother keeping up and voting on all this shit? well you can delegate your vote to someone you think shares your interests.

The fact that these are the arguments within the cardano community, while ETH is still trying to work out if it wants to unlock tokens feels worlds apart - and the reason why I think Cardano is now ahead of ETH in both development and vision. 

I cant sleep. so if anyone has questions then Ill be happy to answer them (i didnt even get to the Midnight sidechain, world mobile, Empowa or any of the promissing projects that actually exist on cardano)"

3/3/23,The Impact Silvergate‚Äôs Failure Could Have On Us As Investors & The Market,"Silvergate Bank is a financial institution that has been a significant player in the cryptocurrency industry, offering banking services to many well-known crypto companies. However, if Silvergate doesn‚Äôt catch itself and truly files for bankruptcy, it could have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market & industry. Silvergate is a financial recognized publicly traded bank, the losses would be enorm. 

The failure of Silvergate Bank could cause a liquidity crisis within the cryptocurrency market. Many crypto companies rely on the bank to provide them with the NECESSARY funds to carry out their operations. Without access to these funds, these companies and exchanges may be forced to shut down or significantly scale back their activities, leading to a market downturn.

Silvergate‚Äôs demise could seriously damage investor confidence in the cryptocurrency industry. If a well-respected financial institution like Silvergate Bank were to fail, it would raise questions about the stability and security of the crypto market, potentially leading to a sell-off of crypto assets and a drop in prices. This would be twice as bad since we‚Äôre already in a bear market. 

To end it off the failure of Silvergate Bank could also have regulatory implications for the cryptocurrency industry. The bank is regulated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the failure of the bank could prompt regulators to take a closer look at the crypto industry, potentially leading to increased scrutiny and tighter regulations. This ultimately makes decentralized crypto more centralized which isn‚Äôt in our favor. 

In the worst case all these events could cause a chain reaction that would damage all of crypto. Especially since the bank stands in the middle of all operations of many big crypto players. This wouldn‚Äôt be too farfetched since the crypto market is very closely intertwined even on a corporate level. 

TLDR: the failure of Silvergate Bank could have far-reaching consequences for the cryptocurrency industry, including a liquidity crisis, damage to investor confidence, and increased regulatory scrutiny. However, it's worth noting that the likelihood of such a failure is relatively low, and the cryptocurrency industry has weathered previous market downturns and regulatory challenges"

4/3/23,Possible dumb question about L2,"I have been searching and searching for an answer to a question that seems to be too dumb since no one else seems to have asked it.

Fair to say that I'm no crypto expert and I'm fairly certain that if this post doesn't get deleted I'll receive a lot of weird responses from other non experts but in the case that someone knowledgeable enough can dumb down the concepts for me, here it goes...

If transactions in L2s (and sidechains) are initiated outside L1 and through some cryptographical magic get compresed or reduced in order to be posted to Ethereum L1 for security and validation, who pays for that fee? I know that ""we"" pay the L2 fee in that network's native token but I imagine that similar to how I pay an ETH gas fee to post on the network the L2 transaction has to pay a fee to get added to the L1 block. Is this how it really works? And who pays that fee?"

This initiative, if implemented, could potentially have a significant impact. My absolute dream would be Reddit creating an open world environment in which users could interact with one another would allow for even greater engagement within the Reddit community. I'm imagining a modernized Habbo Hotel in which various subreddits possess buildings that only users can enter and participate in.

While the idea of gate keeping may not have a massive appeal, it could be a cool idea to open sub-areas or specific rooms that only the the most active users can access. Additionally, certain games could be played against others within the game environment, basic examples would be chess or checkers, with users potentially wagering their Moons against others. Creating more volume within the ecosystem.

I feel it is reasonable to speculate that Reddit have the potential to create something extraordinary. These suggestions are purely hypothetical, and it remains to be seen whether Reddit will explore these possibilities."

Based on my experience in crypto, I  have compiled a list of 10 stupidly simple and obvious crypto scams that you should never fall for. 


1. If you ask a question on  a public platform (like on Reddit,  Telegram group,  Twitter), and then someone inboxes you in private claiming that they're from customer support... ignore them, it's a scam.


2. A beautiful girl DMs you, starts talking about crypto, and tells you about this amazing opportunity where you can make insane returns on your crypto investment. Block him, he's a scammer. 


3. A stranger sends you a random referral link to mint an exclusive NFT, or get on the whitelist of an upcoming project. Delete the link, and block that stranger. It's a scam.


4. You don't remember registering for something, but you get an email that you've won a prize. It says something like ""Click here to claim prize/airdrop""... it's a scam. If the email contains an attachment, DO NOT OPEN THE ATTACHMENT. 


5. Anyone who says I'll send you double crypto if you send some crypto to me first is a thief. It's a scam. 


6. You open a website and it's asking you to type in your seed phrase, it's most likely a scam.


7. That email from Metamask or Trust wallet telling you that your funds are at risk, that's a scam. Ignore it, delete it, don't click on any of the links in the email. 


8. Someone sends you their seed phrase so that you can help them to move funds out of the wallet... it's a scam.


9. Any offer that sounds too generous, too good to be true, and you can't work out where the catch is, you're most likely the catch. Take a moment to ask around before you put in any money.


10. Someone offers you an online job that has too-good-to-be-true wages, then they ask you to send a ""security deposit"" in Bitcoin or any crypto. It's a scam."

You can see the top user, nirada, has netted $5,894 since March 1 with 5 closed trades. They used almost $20k worth of ETH to leverage $1.4M dollars of ETH. You'll quickly notice that PNL drops into the hundreds and down to the $20s, but it's only been four days in March.

On March 1st they Won an astonishing $42k! For most of us, that's life-changing money. Unfortunately, a day later, they lost all the profit in a bad trade that put them in the red -$44k. If you look at their open positions things are not looking well. I'd say that's a rough start to March.

4/3/23,US Government issued CBDC vs existing USD crypto - Which will peg to which? [SERIOUS],"So, assuming**, 8 years into the future**, the US Government implements a nationwide CBDC - $USD.

And the largest, most tech-savvy crypto-native socio-demographic millennial generation, now in their 30s, becomes the predominant market force, Financially dictating and driving the consumer market  and consumer demand. Buying (Teslas, eco-friendly homes and a sustainable mindset).

What will happen if the masses decide NOT to adopt CDBC? What if they don't use it,  - choosing alternative (now established 15 year old) stablecoins like USDC, DAI USDT etc.

&#x200B;

* Your coffee shop - accepts USDC or alt stablecoin.
* Your modern Supermarket accepts USDC or alt stablecoin.
* Your boss pays you in USDC or alt stablecoin.
* Your starter (now incumbent) bank allows USDC loans/mortgages.

What will happen to the US CDBC?

4/3/23,Now we get to see if SBF actually had dirt on Binance and CZ or if it was more talk and lies,"Do you remember all the trash talk SBF had for CZ? He had a number of veiled threats and allegations that Binance and CZ went engaging in unethical behaviour  and heavily implied outright fraud. He said these things before FTX went down but also doubled-down and made even heavy insinuations after the collapse.

For instance after the collapse SBF said that to pick a fight with Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao: 'not a good strategic move on my part"". But he also later said to employees regarding Binance, ""I shouldn't throw stones in a glass house, so I'll hold back a bit.""

Then SBF was set to make a testimony to congress regarding the fall of FTX, however this fell through after he was arrested. However, in his planned speech/comments to Congress SBF was set to say: ""There is much more to say about Binance, its role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and its relationship with FTX, but this is neither the place  nor the time for it."" That's a hell of a statement to make at Congress, and even the idiot SBF knows that.

Given the hot water Binance is in, regarding allegedly knowingly facilitating transactions from criminals and sanctioned entities, misappropriating user funds as well as allegations that they were attempting to get around US securities law through a shell entity/entities, I am sure the courts would love to hear what SBF has to say, and he might even get a deal for less prison time out of it.

Granted we know SBF is full of it, it sure would be interesting if it were true, and if we clean more bad actors out of crypto then why not? Better to take the burn now than let the house of cards gets even higher.

4/3/23,7500 btc lost wallet worth of $165 million today - More reason why we should protect our seed phrase,"Here is a story of lost wallet or should I say lost fortune!

1) Howells' hard drive containing the private keys to his Bitcoins was a standard 2.5-inch laptop hard drive. He had removed it from his laptop and placed it in a drawer, where it remained for several years before he mistakenly threw it away.


2) When Howells realized that he had thrown away the hard drive, he immediately contacted the landfill site and offered to pay for the cost of excavating the area where he believed the drive to be located. However, he was told that this would not be possible due to environmental and logistical reasons.


3) Howells' story has sparked debates about the responsibility of cryptocurrency investors to safeguard their investments, as well as the need for better backup and security measures. Some experts have recommended using hardware wallets, which are designed to store cryptocurrency in a secure offline environment.


4) While the loss of 7,500 Bitcoins is a significant financial setback for Howells, he has stated that he does not regret getting involved in Bitcoin mining and that he still believes in the potential of cryptocurrency as a revolutionary technology.


5) Howells' story is not unique - there have been many other cases of people losing access to their cryptocurrency investments due to forgotten passwords, lost devices, or other issues. In some cases, recovery is possible through specialized data recovery services, but this can be a costly and time-consuming process.


The story of James Howells and his lost Bitcoins is a reminder that while cryptocurrency can be a lucrative investment opportunity, it also comes with significant risks and requires careful attention to security and backup measures.

Key takeaways

1) Keep your seed phrase safe, but please don't fall for scams or apps to store your keys.

2) Invest in value crypto just don't buy any shitcoin

3) Try to be in this for a longer period of time - I know you might say you are in for the tech, it's alright but try to be in for a longer period of time

4/3/23,Italy' Central Bank Governor Indirectly Says Bitcoin Is Gambling Instrument - Bitcoinik,
4/3/23,Elaborating on the idea of crypto runscape,"Since its been coming up in the community a bit and clearly alot of people have a good amount of knowledge around OSRS I want to put foward my idea. Please scruntinise and roast me for things I miss. 

Alright crypto gaming with nft intergration. We know its been tried and failed so many times. Meta and there land ownership was dumb as fuck. But a game like OSRS with gmaing and grinding at the forfront and NFT, blockchain and crypto taking the back of the project is a way I think will work. 

First; you need a game people want to play, it needs to have a grind but be playable and enjoyable by most. OSRS is a great example. 

2nd;Incentive for developers. Make it a subscription based game, similar to ""membership"" on OSRS. No buying the game with one purchase, continued revenue through subscription. Nothing to do with crypto yet. 

3rd; ingame currency, this is when i need some advice. 

Would you create a ingame token that can be brought with btc ect? 

Would the ingame currency be an already established coin? 

Would the ingame currency be a only earned in game coin? no option to buy into the game and instantly be rich? 

4th;NFT

The massive appeal to games like this is the grind to get lucky and get the best items, say I get a super rare drop, when the game first comes out this is going to be worth alottt, once more people get lucky and more people are playing more items like this will enter the game, but with more people playing and entering the game more people will have earnt the ingame currency to buy these items, essintially controlling the market, supply and demand.

Lastly; Botting, simple i think anyway, just implement serious anti botting software like OSRS does. Obviously this isnt perfect and people still bot, but thorugh subscriptions that the bots must pay it earns the devs more money, which can be used to combat the bots more activly. Also the risk of losing everything when your acc you bot on is deleted, along with everything youve earnt.

&#x200B;

Side note; IMO the developers shouldnt be making there own token that people can speculate on and invest in rather then playing the actual game, needs to be something earned ingame and able to be sold for real money, cant just put out mmillions of some coin and say all this and hope peeople buy it on crypto exchanges, this avoids any pump and dump shit from happening.

&#x200B;

Ive probably missed alot and sorry for my shit spelling i might be a tad dyslexic. This is not an idea where non players can invest and take profits, this is an idea for a game to be played and made for gamers not investers."

4/3/23,Overcoming the fear,"So, for the longest time my crypto journey stalled at buying bitcoin on an exchange and sending it to my wallet. I wasn‚Äôt a bitcoin maxi by any means, but it seamed like the safest option. I was absolutely afraid of dipping my toes into the wider crypto world. Decentralised finance, staking, L1 vs L2, the myriad of blockchains and protocols etc etc all made it appear a dangerous, intimidating and mysterious space.

With that in mind, I thought it might be helpful to list the fears we have (or are yet to) overcome to enrich our crypto experience:

1. Using the advanced trading mode to buy/sell/trade - taking the time to figure out what this data overload actually means has paid dividends.

2. Hitting that connect wallet button and signing the transaction - I eventually settled on having a MetaMask wallet to use solely for the purpose of interacting with DApps.

3. Withdrawing/bridging ether to L2/side chains - I never use mainnet for anything these days and it has saved me a fortune/opened up a world of opportunities.

4. Smart contracts - sending your crypto out into the the big wide defi world is hard, but absolutely worth it (when done safely).

5. Liquidity pools/farming/harvesting - it‚Äôs kinda like exploring a strange alien world, but very rewarding once you figure out what‚Äôs what and understand the risks.

6. I, like many, just thought of nfts as a bad joke. Understanding that some have both value and utility in the crypto world is an obstacle I‚Äôm very glad I overcame (Reddit avatars, baby).

7. There is no such thing as a free lunch - this one is specific to moons. It has taken me years to accept that something you can earn simply by posting/commenting on a sub is easily worth the equivalent of a full-time income the world over.

That‚Äôs all that comes to mind right now. Would lover to hear the fears other Redditor‚Äôs have had to overcome/yet to conquer to live their best crypto life."

As mining difficulty and hash rate both hit new ATHs, this also comes after we had the second-longest duration ever for miners being unprofitable.","Without any doubt we can say that the miners are one of the most parts of the whole Bitcoin blockchain as they are the ones running it all basically. But even they have a very volatile income and business as BTC moves down very quickly during a bear market.

Even this bear market was pretty bad for them as in November BTC fell so low that mining it did not make them any profits, before that they were already in a bad state and had to sell a lot of their holdings to just be afloat.

Now the tables seem to be finally turning for them as this year the hash rate of BTC has been in a constant upwards movement and has hit a new ATH already multiple times and now just too.

With that obviously the mining difficulty also goes up which is actually seen as a bad signal but even that seems to not be stopping the hash rate to still go further as miners, no matter what, are not moving down.

 In a bear market, with lower prices and fewer miners, the difficulty may be lower, making mining more profitable

BUYING HAS BEEN PROFITABLE 

Bitcoin's price history shows that buying during bear markets can lead to significant returns in the long term. 

For example, in 2014, Bitcoin experienced a major bear market where the price dropped from around $1,000 to around $200, a decrease of 80%.

 However, those who bought during that bear market and held onto their Bitcoin saw significant returns over time. By the end of 2017, Bitcoin's price had risen to around $20,000, an increase of more than 10,000% from the bottom of the 2014 bear market.

Similarly, in 2018, Bitcoin experienced another bear market where the price dropped from around $20,000 to around $3,000, a decrease of around 85%. 

Those who bought during that bear market and held onto their Bitcoin saw significant returns over time. 

By the end of 2020, Bitcoin's price had risen to around $29,000, an increase of more than 800% from the bottom of the 2018 bear market.

We all know the story of 2020-2021.

Being here I believe that crypto will grow and btc price will grow in coming years.

I got some money on my hand which I want to invest in but I'm confused in my head.

What should I do?

4/3/23,with all the SEC drama lately I thought I would point out some problems with / describe the SEC,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been overly restrictive in its regulation of the cryptocurrency industry. In particular, they argue that the SEC's focus on regulating cryptocurrencies as securities has stifled innovation and limited access to new investment opportunities.

One of the main issues is that the SEC has been slow to provide clear guidelines on how cryptocurrencies should be regulated. This has created confusion and uncertainty for businesses and investors in the industry. The SEC has also taken a tough stance on initial coin offerings (ICOs), which are a popular way for startups to raise funds through the sale of tokens. The SEC has argued that many ICOs are actually securities offerings and therefore subject to securities laws. This has led to a crackdown on ICOs and some high-profile legal cases.

Additionally, some cryptocurrency proponents argue that the SEC's regulatory framework is too focused on protecting investors and not enough on promoting innovation. They believe that the SEC's approach has prevented many promising cryptocurrency projects from getting off the ground and has limited access to new investment opportunities for retail investors.

However, it is worth noting that the SEC has a mandate to protect investors and promote fair and transparent markets, and that its regulatory actions are intended to prevent fraud and protect consumers. The agency is also actively exploring new approaches to regulating the cryptocurrency industry, and may adjust its stance over time as the technology and market evolves"

4/3/23,crypto gaming has a bright future,"Hey, so I've been thinking about diversifying my crypto investments beyond BTC/ETH and my favorite altcoins. And I came to the conclusion that crypto gaming and play-to-earn (P2E) might be a really lucrative opportunity. Hear me out, hold on the hate, not talking about metaverse.

Think about it, have you ever noticed how much more active you are on this sub since they offer P2E incentives (participate2earn)? It's like a game, you get rewards just for participating. This is just an example of how our brain works, wanted to point out something you are probably familiar with so you can understand better my point on view and why this systems will just become more popular.

During the last bull run, my friends that didn't used crypto were all asking me if there were any good P2E games out there. It's a clear indication of how much interest was is in this area, and I believe it's only going to grow exponentially. The entertainment industry is one of the fastest-growing sectors right now.

 Back in the early days, a lot of Web3 gaming projects got a bunch of money even though they didn't really have a clear plan for launching their products or a team that had done it before. But those days are gone now. These days, the studios that are getting funding have already made some successful Web3 games. And the people giving them money are thinking ahead, like five or ten years into the future. The focus now is investing in studios rather that the game itself

The question is what would I buy right? Right now I'm not sure, I'll se what the rabbit hole takes me, any recommendations are appreciated, I'll probably be looking in to the blockchain ecosystem that facilitates the gaming industries. 

I know I'm not providing a lot of information here, DYOR, this is a reminder to not pass on opportunity to invest in what could probably be the biggest gainers in the next bull."
4/3/23,Do you think CryptoCurrency / blockchain is moral?,"I'm not talking about what it may be used for or any of the shady dealings that may involve Crypto.

Is the premise of Crypto one that can be morally-aligned?

Mining and operational costs seem to be a negative for the environment and the energy-conscious. Decentralization is good in theory, but in my opinion, it's only a vehicle for the rich to get richer. This is evidenced by the huge dumps and swings that cripple portfolios. Certain projects, themselves, are obvious schemes and rugpullls that take advantage of vulnerable people.

But on the other hand, I believe that blockchain represents the last line of defense of ownership in a world where the bank and government own everything. In that way, Crypto is a huge asset and can be one of the greatest virtues in the free world."

4/3/23,Will Bitcoin ever hit a new all time high?,"Do you honestly believe that Bitcoin will ever hit a new all time high? 

I have been in crypto for a while, and I love it, but I‚Äôm not sure if I truly believe crypto that it is the future currency or that Bitcoin will ever hit a new all time high. 

I tend to go back and forth on this and I‚Äôm okay admitting it.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I think it‚Äôs very possible, but nothing is guaranteed in crypto. That‚Äôs the first rule of crypto. 

Covid created a perfect storm or events to pump markets to astronomical levels. We saw this in every market across the board. Crypto, Collectibles, Goods, Services, Automotive, Stocks, ect. The list goes on. 

We had sealed video games and Pok√©mon cards selling for a hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Bitcoin is where most of us place our faith, but it‚Äôs not going to be the only be the only coin that is wildly successful. Different coins have different uses and has more coins enter the space, it takes dominance away from Bitcoin, with this in mind, why are we so certain Bitcoin will reach a new all time high? 

I find most new people who enter the space don‚Äôt even talk about Bitcoin anymore. It‚Äôs always some shitcoin.

I feel like most people shill their coins because they‚Äôre heavily invested emotionally due to the amount of fiat they have put into the project, a lot of people are in the negative or overly invested. It creates a situation where they have to believe it‚Äôs going to create a new all time high. 

What crypto do you hold, and do you actually believe your coins are going to hit a new all time high? 

Why are you so sure?"
4/3/23,"Hard Truth.... In order to become rich in crypto, you need to start rich.","As the title says, it takes money to make money. Now this post is not saying you can't make some good gains in crypto because you absolutely can, I'm talking about the fantasy of 7 figures. 

In order to become rich in crypto, you need to start rich. Hate to break it to you but that is real life. People are making Millions in Crypto because they already have money to start with! Yes, just like in real life we hear the stories of jackpot winners who got lucky. That basically sums up all the long term holders who still had their hard drives, the people getting of jail who were forced to hodl, and the people who get lucky with meme coins or early ICOs.

I am sorry to say but to make millions of dollars in Crypto now, you need to have a lot of money to play around with and for 99% of us here, that is not the case. The saying ‚Äúmoney makes money‚Äù is so true. Its easy to become rich if you start rich. For the vast majority of us, we just dont have the funds to throw massive amounts of money around. We are battling inflation, cost of goods skyrocketing, increase cost of insurance, general cost of living, trying to set aside savings, and so many other factors in life; to be able to have money to throw around is not feasible. 

Lately, moons seem to be one of the only possible scenario for a lot of us to have some massive gains from crypto and its all from interaction in a community. No funds needed. That is just awesome to me! 

I just want to temper some peoples expectations that you will one day be rich from crypro as that will more than likely not be the case. DCA what you can afford to lose and one day, hopefully you will have some solid gains to speak of. I pray that itll be lofe changing money but I'd lower expectations so that you could be pleasantly surprised and not massively disappointed."

4/3/23,What's the benchmark to measure on chain transfers against? $1 quadriilion,"When we think about cryptocurrency and it's place in the world of money and finance we compare it to other things. Crypto has a total market cap of roughly $1 trillion. Sometimes people like to compare it to gold which is about $12.5 trillion. Or to stocks which has a total US market cap of $40.5 trillion and globally around $90 trillion. Compared to USD supply? $21.2 trillion.

These numbers are great to compare relative market values to other financial assets. But what about adoption? What's the benchmark?

I was just reading a Decrypt article when I came across this:

*Getting a master account would grant Custodia access to the¬†FedWire network, which handled roughly 200 million transfers for its 4,700 member institutions last year. It‚Äôs specifically designed for large sums of money to travel from one bank to another. In 2022, FedWire transfers totaled more than $1 quadrillion for the first time since its inception in 1987.*

Crypto Bank Custodia Is Taking on the Fed‚ÄîHere‚Äôs Everything You Need to Know https://decrypt.co/122525/custodia-lawsuit-fed-everything-need-know

Seems to me that's the number to watch, to see where crypto really stacks up as a network for transferring money. $1 quadrillion per year.

So how does Bitcoin compare? $8.2 trillion transferred on chain in 2022. A large sum of money by any stretch of the imagination. But still only 0.82% of the value transferred between banks across the FedWire network.

https://coinjournal.net/news/over-8-trillion-was-transferred-via-the-bitcoin-blockchain-in-2022/

How about ETH? Anyone got numbers?

For me this helps put things in perspective and have something to measure by in terms of just where we are in the adoption phase of this technology. What do you think?

4/3/23,Shanghai - what to expect,"Lots of posts trying to analyze whether folks will or won't withdraw staked ETH on Shanghai, based on ETH price at time of staking.  

This is not a very well thought through position.  

This kind of analysis is not a reliable determinant of withdrawal.  Firstly because there's no significant cost to staking, so there's no pressure to withdraw.  Just opportunity.  Crystallizing gain or loss is only one factor in deciding to take such an opportunity.  Second, we have no idea what the cost base was when the ETH was obtained.   If someone staked ETH they got way back in the crowd sale, that acquisition price determines the value of the staked ETH, not the price of ETH at the time. 

Third there are likely more compelling forces that would drive withdrawal. For example, SEC appears to be taking the position that  third-party  staking pools represent a security.  The good news is that folks depositing or withdrawing their own ETH from staking are unlikely to be prosecuted vis-a-vis trading in securities.  The bad news is there are a ton of business models wrapping and staking ETH.   If these are subject to SEC enforcement, their likely resolution would be to either register as securities or shut down.   That in itself could force a rush to the exits, regardless of whether the ETH staked is underwater. 

In short, we have no idea what Shanghai will bring vis-a-vis liquidation of staked ETH.   But we can be sure it is unlikely to be driven by the price of ETH at the time it was staked."

4/3/23,That everyone believes that 2024 will be amazing for crypto because of Bitcoin's halving should be a reason for concern. Four arguments why we might very well crab or dump in 2024 around the halving.,"The Bitcoin halving is projected to occur around early April 2024, when the Bitcoin mining rewards decrease from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. A dominant view is that the halving will be amazing and will get Bitcoin to new all time highs. That is why every day there is a post like this:

https://preview.redd.it/livpjwa4urla1.png?width=630&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=48ae9310d424103fa056c81f1d83787939137908

I would argue the opposite, that it is very possible and perhaps even likely that Bitcoin crabs or dumps in 2024. Let me present four arguments.

&#x200B;

# (1) When we all believe that something will happen, the opposite usually happens

That everyone believes the halving -so 2024- will be great should have us very worried. Retail often gets spoon fed popular narratives that then turn out to be incorrect. Some recent examples:

1. $100K at the end of 2021
2. We cannot go below the previous all time high
3. A bull market will end with a blow off top
4. In the bear market, Bitcoin will reclaim a lot of its market dominance relative to alts
5. $10K at the end of 2021

All of these were entirely wrong. Hence, from this perspective, it makes much more sense for me if Bitcoin pumps earlier and crabs or dumps around the halving.

&#x200B;

# (2) Everyone believes the halving triggers the bull market, but there is an alternative explanation: the stock market

Most people believe that the halving triggers the bull market. It is definitely true that Bitcoin's price always went up after the halving. See the chart below, with the halvings indicated by a purple vertical dashed line.

There is another explanation, however, because the bull market has always happened around the time  that the stock market broke out of a range and went into price exploration. These moments are indicated by an orange vertical line. And that makes sense, as we need the financial markets to be healthy for risky assets to do well.

&#x200B;

# (3) The impact of the halving of the miner rewards gets lower with time, yet the importance of the stock market/global economy is increasing

The impact of the halvings is decreasing. With every new halving, more of Bitcoin's supply is already in circulation, so the idea of a supply shock becomes less plausible. Remember, people talked about a ""supply shock"" all the way from $69K to $15K. In a bad economic environment, it only takes a small portion of the supply to go -70%.

Relatedly, the decrease from mining 50 and 25 Bitoin during the 2012 halving was25 Bitcoin, while the difference in mining rewards at the moment is a mere 3.125 Bitcoin. That is a lot of money, but the 50% decrease is not nearly as important as before.

Yet the importance of the global financial situation and the stock market is *increasing*. The correlation between Bitcoin and the stock market is stronger than ever, as institutions have a bigger piece of the Bitcoin pie. If there is a recession during the halving in 2024 and stocks are performing very poorly, do you see Bitcoin pumping/crabbing? I dont see it happening.

&#x200B;

# (4) 2024 will likely be the year that the FED starts cutting interest rates. People believe rate cuts are bullish, yet historically, all markets crash shortly after rate cuts as a bear market starts

Over the past year, the federal funds rate (interest rates that banks charge) has been increasing at a historic pace. It has already been foreshadowed that we will not see rate cuts this year.

https://preview.redd.it/f5278xu81sla1.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=92c909dcf99d0bd19c34d4e2d071f0abcbdc3ce8

Likely, the rate cuts (decrease of interest rates) will happen next year. People BELIEVE this is great for the markets, but historically, it really is not. The three most recents times when the rate cuts happened were, in order:

1. **November 2000** \- stock market fell \~47% in 23 months (S&P 500) and \~35% in 23 months (Dow Jones Index) - a long bear market
2. **July 2007** \- stock market fell \~57% in 20 months (S&P 500) and \~53% in 21 months (Dow Jones Index) - a long bear market
3. **July 2019** \- stock market fell \~28% (S&P 500) and 33% (Dow Jones Index) in 7 months - a shorter bear market

These three moments are highlighted in the graph below, which shows the Dow Jones Index. After a period where the interest rates stay stable (green box), the moment the FED started cutting the interest rates (after red vertical line), the markets crashed. If this happens again, there's no way Bitcoin pumps, let alone crabs.

*It is my personal view that the Bitcoin halving will not be as great as people here believe. I tried to explain my view. But know that I cannot predict the future either. Note that I do believe this year will be alright. When the rate cuts start, the pain begins imo.* "
4/3/23,Ripple Shows Trump Card To Win Lawsuit Against SEC,
4/3/23,Don't Set Stop-Loss Orders!,"I admit the title is a bit sensationalized. Stop-loss orders are a reasonable risk management tool, but may lead to missed opportunities and unnecessary losses.

Stop-Loss Advantages:

* Limits potential losses: Stop-loss orders can automatically sell a position at a predetermined price level to prevent significant losses.
* Removes emotion from trading: Setting a stop-loss order can help traders avoid emotional decision-making by automatically triggering a sale at a predetermined level.

Stop-Loss Disadvantages:

* Can result in missed opportunities: Stop-loss orders can sell at a lower price level, which may lead to missed opportunities if the price rebounds.
* May not always work as intended:  In volatile markets, stop-loss orders may not execute at the desired price level, leading to unexpected losses.
* You always lose.  If your stop-loss triggers, you are selling when the asset is down, when you probably should be looking for entry points, and you are automatically losing every time.

Alternative Risk Management Strategy:

Instead of setting stop-loss orders, traders should consider developing a systematic trading strategy that utilizes their preferred technical indicators to average in and out of positions over time, and automatically monitor market conditions to determine when to buy and sell. Like a stop-loss, this approach removes emotional decision-making from trading and greatly reduces risk with a sound trading strategy in place.

For example, if the price of an asset rises and triggers a sell order, the trader would sell a predetermined percentage, say 5%, of their position. This would reduce their risk exposure, while still leaving the majority of their investment intact. If the price goes down, a Buy trigger may be likely and the trader could get the increment back at a lower cost.  If the price continues to rise, it is likely to trigger another sell order, gradually reducing the trader's risk exposure, and increasing their average sell price. This approach does not maximize profits since the trader is selling as the price increases, potentially missing out on the peak.  Although it reduces risk,it is not a guaranteed win.  For any statistically sound trading strategy the trader must *sometimes* emotionlessly sell increments below cost, and buy back increments above what they sold for.  

If you want to get started automating market monitoring, first use your favorite technical indicator to determine rules for buy and sell triggers. Then, find APIs that provide data for the technical indicators you use, and use your favorite programing language to automate the rules. If you don't program, you can ask ChatGPT to help you with python (its not as hard as you think).  Finally, periodically, monitor, measure, and adjust.

I'll next post about either: how I determine my buy and sell triggers, or how I measure & test my strategy.  Let me know if you you want to know about either."

This guy just decided to jump ship. He's a free man to do whatever he wants but he didnt have to drag down and morally bankrupt an entire crypto comunitario in the process. If he hasn't figured out the level of influence he has over people and their investments then he is absolutely clueless on what is actually happening.

Truth is we never wanted him. We never considered him one of us because he simply isnt one of us. Elon only cares about Elon.  I for one am glad he is leaving and I hope he does not return. He can have all the fun in the world with his AI bots. 

So what will happen now to Doge? Its a good idea but with little activity. I mean people just hold and maybe fill a block here or there. What is Doge going to do now? What are doge holders gong to do now? Wait for Bezos to adopt Doge? Yikes. That aint happening anytime soon.

Thanks for nothing Elon. Do not let the door hit you on the way out and please don't tweet to us about your new robot name not named floki, shib , bonk or doge. We don't care. Adios."

4/3/23,Zero Knowledge Proofs vs Trusted Execution Environment; Different Technologies for on-chain privacy.,"Wanted to make this post as it seems to me that more people are catching on to the idea of having privacy/confidentiality on-chain, but at the same time, there seems to be a lot of misconceptions about what exactly this means. 

Charles Hoskinson has talked about it \[[Recent Charles Q&A](https://youtu.be/_x8vNm_6TGY?t=1725)\] as did Vitalik. So it is important to understand the 2 main ways of approaching privacy. A protocol uses TEEs or ZK proofs to provide privacy on-chain, is one just simply superior over the other, or is there something else going on here?

**TEEs** are secure areas of a computer or mobile device that ensure that sensitive information is processed securely. They are used to create a secure environment for sensitive operations like private key generation and signing. Examples of networks using TEEs are Oasis Network (ROSE) and Secret Network (SCRT).

**ZK proofs**, on the other hand, are a method for proving the validity of a statement without revealing any information about the statement itself. They are used to prove that a certain computation was performed without revealing the input or output of the computation. ZK proofs are used in many protocols, such as Zcash and Ethereum's ZK rollup, to ensure privacy and scalability.

It still sounds kinda similar, doesn't it? Both provide privacy of sensitive information, but just one (TEEs) is able to be used for Multi-Party Computation(MPC). MPC is a method of securely computing a function across multiple distributed nodes, without any single node seeing the inputs of the other nodes. TEEs provide a secure environment for this type of computation by isolating the inputs and outputs of each node and ensuring that they cannot be accessed by any other node. This allows for secure, private, and verifiable computation among multiple parties.

ZK proofs are typically used to prove the validity of a statement without revealing any information about the statement itself, but they do not inherently provide a way to perform computation across multiple nodes without revealing the inputs or outputs of the computation.

That being said, there is some research on the topic of using ZK proof for MPC, for example, the work on zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs, which are a type of ZK proof that can be used to perform computations more efficiently, but still the overhead and complexity of the proof generation and verification process is high and not yet widely adopted.

Using TEEs does have its drawbacks though, trustworthiness. TEEs are designed to be secure and trustworthy, but there is always a risk of hardware vulnerabilities or supply chain attacks that could compromise the security of the TEE.

So if a company wants to do privacy computation with sensitive data they probably need TEEs to make this possible, but it isn't necessarily the most secure option out there due to there maybe being a hardware vulnerability of some sort.

Does this possibly make TEEs useless as you can not trust them 100%? No certainly not, TEEs make a lot possible that ZK proofs do not, as pointed out by this very recent paper of [Vitalik, Ari Jules et al](https://www.arijuels.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Complete_Knowledge.pdf). A lot of the interesting applications for privacy like big datasets for healthcare and whatnot have to be done with MPC due to its size.

So just wanted to get this information out there, not trying to say ZK proofs are useless just wanted to point out that it isn't the only thing out there. And that both of these technologies have their place in this space. 

Disclaimer: My portfolio is mostly companies that use TEEs."

4/3/23,I asked an AI some standard questions about bitcoin.," Question: can you explain what bitcoin is 


AI's Answer: 

Yes, of course! Bitcoin is a digital currency, also known as cryptocurrency, that was created in 2009 by an unknown person or group using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin is decentralized, which means it is not controlled by any government, financial institution or individual, and operates independently of traditional banking systems.

One of the unique features of Bitcoin is that it operates on a peer-to-peer network, meaning that transactions are directly between users without the need for intermediaries like banks or payment processors. Transactions are verified and recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain, which is maintained by a network of computers called nodes.

The supply of Bitcoin is limited to 21 million, and the currency is created through a process called mining, where powerful computers solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and earn new Bitcoins as a reward.

Bitcoin can be used to buy goods and services online, and some businesses even accept it as a form of payment. Additionally, Bitcoin can be traded on cryptocurrency exchanges like any other currency, and its value can fluctuate widely based on market demand.

One of the advantages of Bitcoin is that it allows for secure and private transactions without the need for personal information or credit card numbers, which can be susceptible to fraud and theft. However, there are also concerns about the potential for Bitcoin to be used for illegal activities due to its anonymity and lack of regulation.

Overall, Bitcoin is a unique and innovative digital currency that has disrupted traditional banking systems and has the potential to transform the way we conduct financial transactions in the future.

My resonse:

so as it seems there are some flaws, IMO btc isnt really private. most criminals will use mixers or monero, so that should be a problem instead of btc. 



my second question was what the future will hold for bitcoin. and i got a mixed answer.

 The answer the AI gave me:

Bitcoin is a relatively new and volatile asset, and its value can be influenced by various factors such as demand, government regulation, and investor sentiment. Some experts predict that Bitcoin will continue to increase in value and become more widely accepted as a mainstream payment method, while others believe that it may experience a bubble and crash.

One of the main challenges facing Bitcoin is scalability. As more people begin to use Bitcoin, the network can become congested, causing transaction times to slow down and fees to increase. There are ongoing efforts to address these issues, such as the implementation of the Lightning Network, which aims to increase the transaction speed and reduce fees.

Another potential factor that could impact the future of Bitcoin is the increasing adoption of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). CBDCs are digital currencies that are issued and regulated by central banks, and some experts believe that they could pose a threat to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

Ultimately, the future of Bitcoin is uncertain and will depend on a range of factors. However, it is clear that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have already had a significant impact on the financial world, and will likely continue to be an important area of innovation and development in the years to come.

My response:

so for me personally i dont think btc will be used as a form of payment but more as an asset, i think other cryptocurrencies will be used as a form of payment, like xlm for example since its fast en cheap. 

for now i'll leave it like this but let me know if you want me to ask other questions, the only reason i asked these questions was simply because i was wondering how an AI would think about bitcoin and not because im trying to prove something to either you or myself. dont take whatever the AI says or will say as a form of research or advise."
4/3/23,"Bitcoin is decentralisation, Proof of stake not","2021 was the year of Crypto becoming mainstream. Billions of people were introduced to all aspects of the industry. Whether it be crypto mining, DeFi, the metaverse and NFTs. There were a lot of things that emerged in 2021. That year was tough year for everyone, with the pursuit of stopping the spread of COVID-19, many businesses bore the forefront of these effects. Even Apple, the 3rd largest US company by revenue, closed down all its stores in response to COVID-19. The uncertainty of that year attracted people to crypto. Bitcoin was worth less than $10,000 in June 2020 before skyrocketing to almost $70,000 in November 2021. Banks, normally against crypto, started buying crypto that year.

Purpose of Crypto

From the man himself, Satoshi Nakamoto wanted Bitcoin to be a currency that people can use on their own terms without interference from the government and large corporations. For this to happen, Satoshi intended that if people supported the blockchain, they would be rewarded in Bitcoin. This was true decentralisation at work, no one had too much control over Bitcoin. According to the Bitcoin developer, there are about 47,000 BTC nodes.

The Dark Side of Crypto

Whilst crypto brought along many exciting innovations to solve global issues, there have been many projects that stained the industry‚Äôs reputation. Rug Pulls, honeypots, sketchy influencers, rubbish NFTs gave crypto a ‚Äòbad look‚Äô. 

The problem with Proof of Stake

The whole Ethereum chain is ‚Äòmerging‚Äô from a Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake combination to purely Proof-of-Stake chain on September 15th 2022. Although the reasoning is noble; stopping climate change, lowering energy usage, and smart contract upgrades. The whole idea of crypto was to stop a few large institutions from controlling the financial system and to put it to the hands of the people. That is what Proof-of-Work did, it gave any 15 year old boy the opportunity to be a part of the Bitcoin network as long as he had a second hand laptop. Even now, if that 15 year old wants to mine Bitcoin now, he would need a few second hand ASICs, connect it to a mining pool, and receive a few dollars of Bitcoin everyday which would pile to a decent amount a year.

Proof-of-Stake on the other hand, ‚Äòopens the gap‚Äô further between the Joe Schmo enthusiast vs the Wall Street banking firm. It takes 32 ETH to run a validator node on the ETH network. That will take $56,000 to run a validator node at 4.1% yearly interest. All for $2,000 a year. You see how inaccessible it is for the average Joe Schmo? Before, he could have 4 RTX 3060Ti‚Äôs running in the background earning $200 a month on Ethereum mining. After the ‚Äòmerge‚Äô, Joe Schmo pooled together 2 ETH from his mining after 16 months. He puts it in a Staking Pool at 4.07% APR before fees. In one year, he would make $143 on staking assuming price is the same. A big downgrade from his mining rewards right?

Ok, time for some random Wall Street banking firm to have its shot in crypto. The firm buys let‚Äôs say 10,000 ETH @ $17 million. They then stake as a validator node at 4.1% APR. Then at the end of the year they get $700,000 in rewards assuming price is the same. See that divide? Joe gets $143 a year, big firm gets $700k. The rich gets richer, and the poor gets bread crumbs. It defeats the purpose of decentralisation when the little guy is left out and only the big guys are in. This makes it susceptible to large institutions taking control of the network and leaving the other person with less. In other words, PoS is not decentralised.

4/3/23,I've been in crypto longer than you and want to discuss the Hex.com contract,"  
I think people have a lot of misconceptions about what this thing actually does and doesn't do  
Look if you hate this thing for some reason, please limit discussion in this thread about what about the contract/game/system you don't like. I've never seen 1 person in ANY THREAD anywhere talk about how they were scammed or hurt by interacting with this contract or trading it.  
I don't want to talk about RH. He's been around as long as I have and knows a thing or two.

I don't want to hear that it's a scam \[just like bitcoin/ethereum is still called by plenty\] or about social media drama fud/fomo.  


I do want to talk about the immutable cross-chain code and what it does and doesn't do  


Let's try and simplify it, yeah? For some reason people jump to lots of conclusions without every having simply learned about it and/or used it.  


1. It can be held in a self-custody wallet like metamask that most are familiar with
2. You can trade it and see almost all the trades on chain because it isn't on many CEX but is very liquid on Uniswap. It's literally one of the top few coins for **years** now on uniswap excluding stablecoins.
3. You can hold it liquid and buy/sell it 24/7, there is no requirement to mine or create more of it
4. You can burn it and receive b-shares or t-shares \[shares of the entire pool\]. About 10% of the system is currently mining inflation from the system for themselves.  
Your apy% is dynamic based on how much/how long the entire pools average and what you choose, if you do
5. It was given free to bitcoin holders and had a brief referral program

I had posted this somewhere else but I think the Bitcoin subreddit deserves it directly. 

Usually I post outside the crypto community, some people blame and mock me for being ""crypto enthusiast"", yeah, it's easy saying that when your inflation rate is less than 10% yearly  and your FIAT currency is accepted and respected worldwide (Maybe I  would be like that too in that situation). 

But for us living in countries with really bad economic management, using something not controlled by a central bank (which usually means politicians), is a relief.

That banknote is ""old"" while still in circulation, its face value is ""1 millon"" which is 1,000,000 Bs. (Bolivares) but because six zeroes were removed by law more than a year ago, not it's 1 ""new"" Bs, they didn't bother creating a new banknote so it's just like that people should understand it says 1,000,000 but it is worth 1. Of course a lot of problems specially with old people. Government just doesn't care.

Exchange rate is 25 Bs. / USD, so 1 Bs. is around 4 cents. You need 25 of these to make 1 USD.

Monthly minimum wage is 130 Bs. so around 5 USD. Or 130 banknotes of 1 Bs."

4/3/23,ARTICLE: [South African retail giant] Pick n Pay takes the plunge with bitcoin payments,
4/3/23,99% of people wont know a thing about bitcoin or lightning and they wont need to.,"99% of people today do not know how central banking works, they do not know how credit card transactions are processed between banks and card issuers and they do not know how fiat based digital transactions are made between financial apps like paypal and cashapp. All they know is they need dollars because the stuff they want is denominated in dollars and they need cash or a card or an app that can pay for it.

In just the same way 99% of people in the future will not know how bitcoin works in terms of its monetary policy, hashrate or block times, and they will not know how the app they use to pay for things propogates lightning transactions for them. All they will know is they need sats because the stuff they want to buy is denominated in sats and they need an app that can pay for it.

99% of the world will never understand the first thing about bitcoin or the lightning network, all they will know is the shops that sell the things they want accept lightning so they need to earn their money in a way that allows them to spend to lightning invoices. All they will know is they need sats in a lightning wallet.

The first 1% of adopters will help kickstart mainstream adoption, but once mainstream adoption has taken on an unstoppable life of its own all that will matter is that there is easy to use infrastructure ready for the average person to be able to earn sats and spend sats in a simple secure way without them having to think.

We have just seen xapo private bank become the first to integrate lightning, this is a big deal and it points to the beginning of a trend that will see all banks on earth having to plug into lightning or risk becoming completely disused over the coming decade. By 2030 most if not all banks will allow their customers to recieve from and send to lightning invoices with their balances held in fiat initially but over time as fiat continues to debase more and more people will just hold their savings in sats.

The education curve has taken place for the early adopters that needed it. The rest of the adoption process will be completely organic and natural and feed on itself at a rapid rate without 99% of people needing to understand anything at all about the technical aspects of bitcoin and lightning."

My life has been very stressful lately since my dad passed away a few months ago and I moved to a new apartment. 

Packing everything up in the new apartment, I just realised my recovery seed is missing. I have my legder nano and a bunch of meaningless seeds, my only important seed was supposed to be there - somehow it isnt. 

So, I have two more guesses in my ledger to do then it will destroy itself. 

Maybe I have another chance also, that is why I created this post. A few years ago I did buy a coldcard device that I still have. And what I can remember is that I did a recovery with my 24 words on this device. And I think my device is still configed for this wallet (most likely it isnt). 

I have a paper that says:
Coldcard
Prefix XXXX
Recoveryword1
Recoveryword2
Pin XXXX

The recoverywords are real words and X is numbers. 

Can I use this to sign transactions?
The thing is, I have searched my laptop for a wallet that should be connected to this coldcard device, but without success. I dont remember how this device works and did not use it because it was too complicated.

I guess I have no choice but to guess the right number on my ledger - or find my coldcard wallet on my laptop and hope it is connected to my coldcard device?"

If this would happen, the total market cap of BTC would be around $10 trillion to $20 trillion. That is almost equivalent to the size of M2 USD ([The current M2](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL)).

So, I am wondering if such a high BTC price would be a serious threat  to the position of USD. If so, I believe the U.S would not just sit and watch BTC, but act to damage it.

4/3/23,"Buying $500 or so in BTC Without KYC, ID, or a Phone?","No, nothing nefarious going on. Just $500 or so for a service online that only takes BTC. What's the easiest way to buy BTC without KYC, ID, or SMS, if there is one? 

Also, is it possible to buy BTC with a MasterCard or Visa GIFT CARD anywhere online without KYC/ID/SMS? Just straight up enter the card details on the site and have them send that amount to a wallet?

Where's the best place to find face-to-face BTC sellers?

Best place to find BTC ATMs that don't require ID or your fingerprint?

All this is pretty searchable but I read conflicting and outdated information when searching up on it, so I'm looking for someone to give me up to date info.

**ABOUT SURGE PROTOCOL:**  
$TACO has been launched on BNBChain with a SRG20 contract. SURGE Protocol is an on-chain protocol which operates on BNBChain and ETH Mainnet.  
The simplest way to describe this protocol is to look at it as a ""blockchain"" on an already populated blockchain, without the need to bridge any SRG tokens to anywhere. It's a direct competitor to Unƒ∞Swap and PancakeSwap, which does not use external LP's we're used to see from these.

**Features of SRG20 projects:**  
\- Unruggable LP, customer funds are stored directly in the contracts which have no withdrawal function  
\- No DEX fees (unlike UniSwap and PancakeSwap)  
\- About 80% less network gas fees (no router in the way)  
\- Full MEV Bot sandwich front-running protection  
\- Launch projects without initial liquidity  
\- Buy/sell with contract functions (doesn't matter if a swap/website goes down, you can always buy/sell SRG & SRG20 tokens via direct blockchain interaction)  
*.. and many more!*

You buy SRG tokens with BNB/ETH first, then you can directly buy SRG20 BSC/ETH tokens (like our $TACO) with these SRG tokens on the SurgeSwap or the respective SRG20 tokens BSCScan page. All SRG20 tokens are only paired with SRG.

So i supply my ID photos, take selfie picture, and get it verified, although it took several attempts. Keep in mind I've been verified as I've gone through this process years ago.

&#x200B;

Try again...nope, still restricted. Chat with support again and they open up a case for me. Says it will take 14 days.

I got on with support again today, even though it hasn't been 14 days, and they say account specialists are still looking into it.

&#x200B;

Lol between this and seeing all these posts on the forum, what the fuck is up with this company? This will absolutely be the last time I use this exchange for anything. As soon as I get access to my funds they are being moved off elsewhere and I will use another exchange.

Really, the most infuriating part is the lack of transparency. Why can't they even tell me why my account is restricted? Random red flag pops up freezing my account?"

What you‚Äôll have to do and it shouldn‚Äôt have to be this way is:

complain on Reddit till a support staff gives you a link to submit a ticket( I still cannot find it organically ). The more public the faster they‚Äôre gonna work.

Submit the ticket and you‚Äôll get an email asking you some really personal questions that only serve to remove coinbase from having anything to do with someone forcing you to launder money. It does nothing to stop laundering or help a victim, feels quite uncomfortable being forced to answer these personal questions to strangers holding your money hostage till they ensure they get what they want.

All while going back to Reddit support cause support in the public eye is the only coinbase support that will help you in a decent manner. Chat support especially they‚Äôre savages. Almost as bad as Sony chat/phone support combo.

And yes they‚Äôre holding your money hostage. Support will tell you the block doesn‚Äôt stop you from sending the money back to your bank. But that too will be blocked. And at the end they will send you an email specifically to say they gave the money back.

Then when you reply to that email you will get an automated response saying that coinbase no longer allows incoming email. That‚Äôs not verbatim. Shoot me.

So you gotta open a new ticket with your first tickets ticket number, link your Reddit post, tell everyone there that they‚Äôre on blast and you‚Äôll have your money by the next day."

It keeps giving unable to Generate , Try again later message , Over and over and I used different platforms and even cellphone to do that and yet unable to do.   What a Shame from the biggest Crypto Exchange in U.S ... anybody else in the same shoe ? What am I suppose to do ? I need the Turbotax CSV file.

Also , Not to mention , I see that for 2023 , they have had a bug and calculated all my crypto wrong and say they have missing costbase , this is while I have used only coinbase to conduct buy/sell in advance , and nothing else. No Transfer , No even Self Custody wallet , all direct from Coinbase with USD , but 2023 is also all messed up and they are the one supposed to have my cost basis , they have also categorized my buy and sell in ""Others"" Category in summary, what a mess and headache  . That's my secondary problem but it's for 2023 next year. Right now my focus is to get the 2022 CSV for turbotax

4/3/23,Coinbase account blocked for 7 months with funds inside,"Hi all,

Throwaway account, based in the UK. I'm hoping someone may be able to help with what I can do to access the funds/coins in my Coinbase account.

I've been ""blocked"" from my Coinbase account since August 2022. I don't care about the reason for my account being locked or want access to it - I just want to be able to move my coins out. At time of being locked out they were worth around ¬£10k, but I don't have a record of exact amount of coins so can't say what they're worth now. 

Timeline:

* 24th August 2022 - email notification from Coinbase that my account was being closed.
* 27th August 2022 - Coinbase support confirm via email that my account has been closed but that I could still have limited access to my account to transfer coins out to an external wallet. I had an amount of ETH2 staked which isn't possible to transfer, so I asked for confirmation that my account would stay open until it could be released. This was confirmed in writing by the support team.
* 15th September 2022 - I tried to access my Coinbase account to move my funds to another wallet, but a message appeared when trying to log in that said I was blocked. This is still the message I receive to this day.
* 16th September 2022 - I opened another support ticket to question my account being completely blocked. This ticket was closed without reply.
* 22nd September 2022 - I submitted a formal complaint to Coinbase using their complaints procedure to request either limited access to my account to transfer my coins out, or that they send the coins/value of my account to me via other means. 
* 18 November 2022 - Coinbase respond to say they are ""unable to restore these restricted capabilities back to my account"". There was no acknowledgement of the coins/funds in the account or how I can get them back.

This was the last communication I received from them, despite me sending a number of follow-up emails.

As mentioned before, I accept that they can close my account at any time. However, I don't accept that they can also retain my money when doing so. Can anyone help with this? Some questions I have:

&#x200B;

* Is this something the financial ombudsman can assist with in the UK? As Coinbase appear to be based in the US, are there options I can pursue via US regulatory bodies?
* Do I have a legal right to the money & coins in my account? 
* I'd rather avoid small claims court due to the fee and work involved. If it comes to it though, am I likely to have any success? I'm worried that I have very limited documentation to show how many coins I had and their worth in my account, so will be unable to prove the amount I'm owed. I can show bank statements and transfers from other crypto exchanges into the account, but the value of the coins doesn't necessarily reflect what I paid for them.

Any help for what steps to take next would be greatly appreciated! Thanks."
4/3/23,"coinbase told me i'm verified and that my bank etc info was verifed then gave me a 0 dollar limit, contacted support, they told me they couldn't explain.","That's basically all.  I gave the exact same information to binance and kraken and everything went smoothly and I can use them.  I am however allowed to use wire transfer, debit, and pay pal.  Obviously I won't since I can just use a competitor but can anyone enlighten me as to what the cause could be?

The fact that they even didn't offer any explanation or fix was the most confusing.  We cannot fix, we cannot tell you what's wrong, we cannot explain our security measures was basically what was said.  Maybe understandable about not divulging security info but probably odd."
4/3/23,Purchases no longer immediately available for sending,"I‚Äôve been using coinbase for years and today noticed something weird happening.. I usually buy $1-200 of crypto at a time with my bank account and send it to my personal wallet immediately. This even worked earlier this week. Today, I bought $200 of btc but apparently I have to wait 6 days to be able to send it outside of coinbase‚Ä¶ why is this happening? As far as I can tell, nothing has changed (i.e. my id is not expired, etc). ~~I don‚Äôt see anything suggesting my account is restricted or something similar.~~ I just went into the support chat and it says ‚ÄúI see you have limited account access. Can I help with this?‚Äù But I don‚Äôt know why my account would randomly be limited and I have no emails or anything explaining this.

Usually, when I purchase something I get an email saying ‚ÄúYou can send or trade your BTC immediately.‚Äù But this time the email says ‚ÄúYou can trade your BTC immediately on Coinbase. You can send your BTC off of Coinbase starting on Mar 9, 2023.‚Äù

Wanted to send 1$ USDC to my friend via email address option because we are both Coinbase users and it's instant, without fee. Also, 1$ amount was a test, if all is good, we would transfer more.  Upon clicking ""send now"" button, the Coinbase system sent the whole USDC wallet containing 113$ and not only that, it sent it to a random crypto address and not an email address I've provided in a sending form.

After that i could not believe my eyes what happened, so we tried one more time, this time it was a wallet containing 10$ and we made sure that we have proof of this so i made screenshot. And again, the system sent the whole wallet amount to a random crypto addres.

I have talked to Coinbase support the whole day, they are just repeating that sending to a wrong address is irreversable and not their fault. While i have provided them with screenshot proof and telling them that it is a huge bug in their system and that is their responsibility. They don't even want to inform their technical team or managers. This is so frustrating, because someone else could loose a lot more money.

I spent the whole day trying to warn them and get a refund since this is clearly their fault.

I have not tried if this aplies to other cryptos or just USDC and honestly I am scared to make any transaction on my Coinbase account until this resolves.

They are having a big maintenance today. Maybe they are aware of this but don't admit it because a lot of user funds is lost?

I had trust in Coinbase, this left me really disappointed.

Any suggestion of what I could do more?

I'll keep you updated if this gets resolved.  


EDIT: upon my research i found out that the crypto address to which funds are sent is the same as one of my receiving USDC addresses. So, funds should be in coinbase's internal wallet, and this should be reversable, but they claim that this is an external address."
4/3/23,Coinbase can't tell me why my card is declined,"So I've been using my Coinbase card at Costco for at least two years. Today, for some strange reason, it got declined for both groceries and gas. I called support and their response is - I can see why it was declined but I can't tell you why it's declined, I can't tell you if future charges at Costco will be declined, and I can't tell you if charges at other merchants will be declined.

What is this insanity? If my bank card gets declined then I call them, they explain why, and we get it resolved. With Coinbase there's nothing they can do?? Why would I even take the chance on preloading the card?

Have any of you had better luck getting answers?"
