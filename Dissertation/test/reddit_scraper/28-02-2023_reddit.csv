26/2/23,"One of the oldest ETH wallets holds 250,000 ETH, untouched since ICO!","It's one of the most mysterious and diamond handed addresses in the Ethereum ecosystem! 

Someone bought $75k worth of ETH at the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) in 2014. It's a dead wallet per se as it has never made a single transaction for the past 9 years!
 
The wallet holds 250,000 ETH now worth ~$400 Million.
He/She holds 0.2% of the entire supply.
That's an ROI of 533,700% from the initial 75k investment.

Either this guy forgot his seed phrase or he has the biggest diamonds in the history of Ethereum.

Or maybe he/she's waiting for $10k ETH. Only time will tell!

Edit: It also proves that wallets don't drain themselves if you don't click fishy links.

27/2/23,Solana has gone down 10 times now,"0th time (Beta). December 4th 2020. Mainnet Beta cluster stopped producing blocks.

1st time. 14th September 2021. Down for 17 hours 12 minutes due to a DDoS attack on a DEX. 

2nd time. 6-8 Jan 2022. Outage for multiple days . Presumably DDoS attack.

3rd time. January 10th 2022. Possibly still same DDoS attack.

4th time. January 22nd 2022. 29 hours of downtime, lots of duplicate transactions causing congestion and outages

5th time. March 28th. RPC nodes forked off when upgrade to v1.9 happened.

6th time. April 30th 2022. 7 hour outage due to millions of NFTs being minted. 

7th time. May 27th 2022: Block times delayed up to 30 minutes.

8th time. June 1st 2022: ""A runtime bug triggered by the durable nonce transactions feature allowed, under a specific set of circumstances, for a failed durable nonce transaction to be processed twice."" Lasted about 5 hours. 

9th time. October 1st 2022: A misconfigured node resulted in lost data and needs to restart from a previous point, which apparently crashes the entire chain.

10th time, most recent one: ""Solana Mainnet is experiencing a large forking event right now, validators are investigating to determine the network health, root cause and next steps. Transactions may fail right now"". Lasted for about 20 hours."
27/2/23,"One of the most important rules of thumb I learned in crypto: If you heard of the pump, you're already late to it.","Pumps are the events every crypto enthusiast dreams of. It is the visceral adrenaline rush of watching the green line shoot up perpendicular to the X axis of the chart. It's the 5x, 10x, 100x everyone hopes they'll see some day. So, when people hear of some pump going on with some project, they rush to it, trying to hop on the Gain Train to arrive quickly at Rich Station. They watch the chart doing a remarkable 5x over the last week and they hit the button: they buy their ticket to financial independence and they're set for life. Right? 

Wrong. 

**Pump chasers are bag holders. That's the short of it.**

Pumps are mostly unpredictable events and even when they are predictable, like in some pump and dump schemes, they are only so for a minority of early market manipulators.

There are ways to gauge if a crypto project has a shot at success. They usually have sensible tokenomics, real world applications, dedicated and transparent dev teams, and a thriving community of people supporting it. But there is no way to know when the magic will happen. Best you can do is buy and hope for the best.

The game is even trickier with meme coins. Those are legit gambling. There's no way to tell whether a coin ending with Inu or Rocket will 10x in a week. It is almost totally random, dependent on whatever thing generates hype in pop culture the next week and is able to attract enough gullible people to throw their money at it. Best you can do to nail one of these pumps is to have some dark magic level of luck.

Pumps also happen very fast. They are usually over in about a week. There is usually a steady positive slope that precedes a pump that some people do see happening and manage to make the right bet at the right time. But this is no fool-proof way of finding an early pump, as there are countless projects that usually display these ascending slopes but never really have a blow-off top like real pumps have.

So when price action gets really crazy with those 420% in a day and the rest of the market hears of it, we are usually seeing the final leg of the pump. ***Experienced traders know they are late, so they will only play modest hands expecting modest returns. They know they have, in the very best case, a 2x ahead of them. Mostly, they'll be happy with skimming off a 10-20%.***

***But many inexperienced traders/investors will look at a 10x over the last week believing they still have 10x ahead of them; that this is only the beginning, the new normal.*** Sorry to break it to you: These are the bag holders. These are the ones who are not gonna make it. These are the ones that will provide exit liquidity to the early hopefuls who invested when no one was paying attention.

So key take away from all this: *if you hear of the pump, you are late to the pump. Play accordingly, don't be reckless.*

Edit: some typos here and there."
27/2/23,"I expected a bear market to make me feel negative emotions like anger and fear, but is it just me or is this bear most of all really damn boring?","Years ago, when I envisioned what it would be like during a bear market, the thought of it always scared me. I had imagined that I would feel a wide range of negative emotions during the bear, like anger and fear. This was true at first, though never to degree that I had feared of.

But now, for many months already, the bear market is mostly really damn boring. Bitcoin just spent over 250 days in the same trading range. It is nice that we had a pump, but in essence we are just back at the same prices from August 2022.

There also just isnt much exciting stuff happening. Most news is just another minor detail regarding the same damn news event we have seen for years and/or will see for many years to come. Examples:

* People are not happy with FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried.
* Mt. Gox unlocks are delayed.
* SEC randomly picks something to regulate while ignoring the projects that we need protection from.
* Solana is down again.
* Tiny yet totally insignificant XRP SEC case update or view.
* Useless person predicts lower prices! Another useless person predicts the exact opposite.

Even this sub is mostly going in circles. There is not much new content, although thankfully there's some exceptions. I made a Bingo last year and even the content of that Bingo still works fine.

27/2/23,"Ethereum is now consuming 99.99% less energy through The Merger for Proof of Stake, and its not even been a half a year since then.","If we would go back exactly one year, one of or maybe even the most anticipated Crypto events was The Merger, the event where Ethereum would finally transact from Proof of Work to the Proof of Stake mechanism. After years of waiting and delays we had it happy, right in the middle of the bear market on 15th September of 2022, a historic date nonetheless.

Now just about 5 months later we can already have a look at the effects of this Merger, one of the biggest that also shuts down most Crypto haters is that Ethereum is now consuming 99.99% less energy than before The Merger.

&#x200B;

[Chart from the official CCRI site](https://preview.redd.it/nfo1qr09zrka1.jpg?width=1765&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a84dc247f08125e1292accb4ec26dc9b33c143a1)

Here we can see the chart from a report by the CCRI, the Crypto Carbon Ratings institute.The electricity consumption has fallen from 23 million megawatt hours per year to now just 2.6k megawatt hours per year. Also the CO2 emissions have fallen from 11 million to 870, a near 99.99% drop too.

That is a very good illustration of the changes too from pre-Merger to now post-Merger Ethereum.

It surely has been a good development but we should also not come up and say tat Bitcoin should do that too because PoW is what makes Bitcoin to Bitcoin, we also should not care about the critics of Bitcoin here as they will find another argument if not the energy consumption of Bitcoin. But let me know you opinion too down there:"
27/2/23,"Why is everything so controversial in the crypto space, why is everyone so bitter to each other?","Don’t get me wrong, out of all of the subreddits for crypto id say this is the best one. But why are so many people so hateful? 

I see people who love Solana get thrashed, absolutely demolished. Don’t get me wrong, not the biggest fan for obvious reasons. But it’s so bad.

Im actually on the Solana subreddit and this guy made a post saying how the recent drama with Solana being down was the final straw.

Honestly I don’t blame him, they try to be adopted more, and add a Solana pay option, but the coin goes down? 

And I checked the comments, this poor fella was thrashed, people calling him delusional, and he has no idea what he’s doing. 

And I swear they do a whole background check on this dude, literally investigating his profile. 

If you have a different opinion, that doesn’t mean you need to thrash someone to the ground. 

I sold all my sol ages ago, and the dude who made that post posted 14 days ago that he bought some sol. It was such a wholesome post because he was just happy he bought. 

Only to sell 14 days later for a valid reason, and instead of the Solana community show this guy their views and their opinions on the value they see on Solana. 

They just thrashed him. And it’s not just Solana, I’m not going to name other coins, I’ll probably be downvoted to the oblivion for making this post. 

But if you love a coin, don’t just turn against someone because they sold and lost hope. It only pushes people further away from the coin."

27/2/23,Moon Liquidity on SushiSwap since launch of Arbitrum Nova,"While we are all eagerly waiting for CCIP-051 to go live, a lot has happened in the last weeks. I'm not aware of any way to view the history of the liquidity on Nova, so I reconstructed it from the on-chain history. To get the transaction data I used the [Arbiscan API](https://docs.arbiscan.io) and the [Coingecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) for price conversion.

Let's have a look at the largest Moon liquidity pool, the MOON/WETH pair on SushiSwap- When the proposal was made \~18 days ago, Liquidity was fluctuating between 200k and 250k Moons while the amount of WETH just reached an ATH of over 24 WETH from the recent moon rally.

Today, not even 3 weeks later we are sitting at 479k Moons and 54.4 WETH. It more than doubled since the proposal was made, and the rewards aren't even live yet.

[Moons in red, WETH in blue, green arrow shows when CCIP-051 was first mentioned](https://preview.redd.it/bvn7h4nksqka1.png?width=1276&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=621fade5f77b26b2fd3e622bf53b7be4d9066dfc)

&#x200B;

The total liquidity in fiat value can be seen here and sits at 180k USD right now.

&#x200B;

I don't know where this will be going - did all interested people already add liquidity, or are some still waiting for the rewards to live? But one thing seems clear: While Moons have pumped before, they never got such amazing support by increased liquidity before. 

&#x200B;

**tl;dr:** Moons are finally growing up - not only did we get the first real lasting use case with the banner, but we also more than doubled liquidity in less than 3 weeks."

27/2/23,78% of Bitcoin's circulating supply is in the hands of long term holders. That is more than 15 million coins! This is good for crypto and for us.,"As of today, 78% of the circulating supply of Bitcoin is in the hands of long-term holders. This means that more than 15 million coins have not been moved for at least six months.

You can see the graph, made with Glassnode by James V. Straten, below, with Bitcoin's price in black and the percentage of circulating supply in the hands of long-term holders in blue. As the graph shows, over time, more and more Bitcoin are being HODLd and every new bull cycle a new peak is made.

That so much of the supply resides with long-term holders is a great sign. Historically, a new peak of Bitcoin's circulating supply is made just before or during a significant rally. I highlighted these periods in red below. This happened in 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2019, and 2020/2021.

Got some [data](https://www.isoldmyhouse.com/real-estate-prices-around-the-world/) and decided to make the conversion using today's prices. I chose an area of 70m2 (\~753 sqft) because it is a somewhat acceptable place for two persons and maybe one kid. I've used $0.19 per Moon as benchmark.

What was your most successful trade and how did you come to make it? Before a river of low effort comments like ""buying high selling low"" are coming, I wanna mention I'm mostly interested in hearing out how you guys identified the right time to buy and sell, besides a just HODLing for a number of years.


My most successful one was Harmony One. I was just getting started with technical analysis and I used a combination of MACD, RSI and Fear and Greed index to identify the key points to buy (bought most of it before the first pump, bought the rest during the mid crash before the final pump). Finally, I sold everything very close to the Top when a MACD crossing occurred and RSI indicted a loss in momentum. The fear and greed index also showed that the marked was at extreme greed I remember. Best time to sell. I have to say it was 80% analysis and 20% luck, because for a split of a second I doubted myself and thought I was selling too early, despite everything showing that there was a loss in momentum.


So, let me hear your stories.

Ransomware is a type of malware, or malicious software, that locks up a victim's data or computing device and  threatens to keep it locked — or worse — unless the victim pays the attacker a ransom (IBM's definition).

To avoid being targeted, try to have good security practices:

* If you have sensitive data on your devices, try to store them locally, not on the cloud, and have more than one backup
* Don't allow your mobile to store sensitive data on the cloud and regularly back it up

27/2/23,Cryptocurrencies are not securities,"And don't believe SEC and Gary Gensler can prove all of them are. There is absolutely no case law to prove his point, and the history of many different blockchain projects proves he is indeed wrong.

&#x200B;

So, SEC is arguing all crypto is a security (apart from BTC). Why? Bcs they are following one (slightly outdated) theory: whether there is sufficient decentralization in a crypto project at any given point in time.

But they are (somewhat) wrong as it's not all black or white. Not all cryptocurrencies are the same. Same principles cannot be applied to all of them. E.g. they can say ETH was a security. And it was in a way. Why? Bcs it was centralized at the moment of the ICO. However, ETH did the impossible, and has morphed over time, thereby achieving decentralization.

Also, they are applying the Howey test (to an extent). 4 elements of the Howey test, and one would need to pass all 4 tests, include:

1. An investment of money
2. In a common enterprise
3. A reasonable expectation of profit
4. Derived from the efforts of others

If you pass the Howey test, it's a security (and you must adhere to a strict set of regulation). Again, looking at solely that one point in time, ETH was security during it's ICO (even the former head of SEC said he didn't see a single ICO that was not a security).

The Howey test is also one of the reasons certain coins/tokens (I can think of some storage coins) don't allow price talk: it would classify them as securities, as an investor would expect a profit derived from the effort of others.

The thing is, there is a difference between initial investing in a project from the cryptoasset being traded. Me trading ETH with a counterpart, through an intermediary such as a CeX or DeX, has nothing to do with the initial investment or expecting a profit.

No Gary, they are not securities. And you should know better."
27/2/23,What will it take for you to flip bullish?,"I have been noticing a lot of bearish sentiment around here again. 

I’m a bit confused and would like some personal opinions on why the majority is still bearish.

The SP500 bottomed 137 days ago. It’s currently retesting the 1 year down trend line after a strong break out. This is good! 

Bitcoin bottomed 109 days ago and has been in a strong uptrend since. It’s up 67% 

Why are we going against the trend and calling bear when the signs are clearly bullish?

I know I know. Regulation right? 

Regulation is not a bad thing, and without it we will never reach mass adoption. As much as we love to hate regulation. It’s for the best and good for sustainability.

Until I see traditional markets break down or Bitcoin setting a lower low I see no reason to be bearish. 

The majority of people just seem to be repeating the stuff they hear in the news. 

“yield curve, CPI, Jobs report” ect. 

The bull market has to start somewhere and things don’t happen overnight, it will take years to play out. 

I guess we could call this the accumulation phase but I call it the start of the bull run. I believe the bottom is in. 

By the time this sub calls bull they will miss out on 100% gains or more. 

Give me some good reasons to be bearish! 

Let me know your thoughts."
27/2/23,"Binance Trades Majority of BUSD to USDT, 5 Billion Dumped for Dollars","Since Feb 13 Paxos stopped mining BUSD. Most likely from SEC pressure. Over 5 Billion BUSD has been redeemed for dollars. A good since it didn’t depeg. Also all withdraws are still active thankfully. So there were about 16.1 billion BUSD coins in circ, but now there are around 11,129,348,406 BUSD circulating. Binance trade the most volume at 6.84 Billion and the majority of transactions have been found to be to USDT. Strange enough the Turkish Lira was about 3% of transactions.

While this is all a lot to take in and understand why Binance wouldn’t try and back up their coin and instead fold but the bright side is….

No one is losing money

BUSD is still 1:1 pegged with the $

No accounts are “temporarily frozen”

Withdrawals are active and user funds are safe and sound 

Binance isn’t being shit down by the SEC

Now we can just add BUSD to the list of dead / dying stables coins. In the coming years I hope to see more controlled burns like this when we see a token die. Binance is trying to make sure the market knows everyone is fine and most likely this is due to new regulations in swing. USDT is going to stay the popular option for now with low fees and not under the thumb of regulators for the moment."
27/2/23,Bull run isn’t going to be here for awhile,"Hi everyone,

A lot of influencers call for a bull run every time the market goes up 3%. In my opinion, we’re about a year away from the beginning of the bull run. BTC halving, hopefully interest rates will have fallen and who knows what else I’m hoping will be a catalyst for some upside. There is the potential that I’m wrong and please do not invest based on my guess.

Anyone here disagree with me? If you think we’re in a bull run I’d love to hear why. I just feel like the macro is still awful and with the possibility of WWIII who knows how shaky things could get.

Would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks!"
27/2/23,Gary Gensler’s Take on Crypto Doesn’t Matter,
27/2/23,Gary Gensler is a security token,"Reposting due to last flair being too accurate.

There are four prongs that must be met to be considered a security in the Howey Test:

1. A party invests money
2. In a common enterprise
3. With the expectation of profiting
4. Based on the efforts of a third party

This is how Gary Gensler meets all four prongs and passes the Howey Test:

1. Private sector finance firms have invested money
2. Seeking to harm the blockchain industry with lack of regulatory clarity, inane lawsuits, and allowing fraud like FTX and Luna Terra
3. Profiting by harming and misregulating the blockchain industry and trying to make traditional finance firms the crypto custodians
4. Based on the efforts of SEC chairman Gary Gensler

Gary Gensler is therefore a security and has been one years before he became SEC chairman. He helped repeal the Glass-Steagall Act, making him one of the unregistered securities responsible for the 2008-2009 crash."

Here is the current map of crypto legality by country. Pretty green for now...

So.. crypto is pretty widespread by now. If big leaders want to slow down crypto the easiest way would be to cut it out from the banking system completely.  You can tell banks to not allow people to send money to crypto exchanges etc. That's the big lever that can be pulled by USA, Europe and others... depending ofc on how shortsighted their politicians are.  

Even if they somehow manage to shut it down in mentioned regions, other countries like Singapore/UAE etc could go and say - Come, build your business here.  So in the long run this is simply a poor strategy.   

In essence, you don't ban crypto... you just ban yourself from it.   

At this stage crypto, and BTC especially is basically like a virus that is impossible to contain. And it all started in Satoshi's lab... and we can't even find the guy :p

27/2/23,I’ve never seen this community so polarized on the state of the market,"Has anyone else felt this lately? It’s so interesting to see how this sub changes as the market changes. 

During the Bull, I saw bull mania so strong that you could actually feel the adrenaline coursing through every comment. The daily became delirious and you could tell that no one was thinking straight anymore. You feel it too, you’d open up the sub and get so excited about the prospect of BTC at $100k or a brand new coin that was pumping 200% in a day.

During this Bear, there’s such an oppressive sense of doom and gloom in here. The daily is deserted. The FTX collapse felt apocalyptic as so many people rushed to exit different exchanges and this sub was all but taking bets on who was the next to fall.

But as of right now I’ve never seen sentiment so polarized. Positive news is met with skepticism and negative news is deemed inconsequential. Are we in a Bear or a Bull? The comments are split down the middle. Have we hit the bottom or do we have further to fall? The top comment says the worst is behind us, while the next says that we haven’t *because* so many people are sure we already have. Even with regards to the current state of the world and the resulting market conditions, sentiment seems evenly divided between those who believe the war in Ukraine has made its impact and those who believe we’re edging closer to nuclear annihilation. Are we walking into the next Great Depression or are markets primed to launch despite the uncertain world climate? Odds are apparently 50/50.

I don’t know what it means for crypto or the state of the market, but it’s truly fascinating to watch a community that can get so swept up in both positive and negative momentum become so divided on what the future holds."

27/2/23,"The worst hack in Crypto, probably ever: The Platypus hacker got arrested within 1 week and had no access himself to his hacked funds in the first place.","Crypto surely has a very long history of hacks happening, just last year we were nearly get big hacks happening every week and even some of the biggest ones that caused the near-demise of Cryptos such as Axie Infinity and Harmony ONE. Last week we had a smaller hack of $9M but it was probably the worst and dumbest hack there has ever been.

The DeFI protocol Platypus which is a stablecoin swapper build on the Avalanche blockchain, the hacker used a Flash Loan to get $8.5M out of it and here is a look at the fabulous timeline afterwards:

1. The hacked funds got stuck in the used contract by the hacker because he forgot to implement a withdrawal method to it. That contract was also made non-upgradable.
2. A counter-hack was capable of recovering $2.6M from it.
3. The hacker also had another $400k stuck at a AAVE flash loan contract, which also got recovered.
4. The hacker used a ENS domain, thus ZachXBT on Twitter could trace down the hacker and found out that the ENS domain used for the hack was connected to Twitter and Instagram profiles, called “retlqw“.

5. The hacker deactivated his accounts after ZachXBT messaged him to negotiate.

6. Just gets better as the hacker was registered on Binance with KYC thus the police could       get his real identity and he got arrested in under one week.

I think there is nothing to be ashamed of if we do end up being scammed, what's important is learning from our mistakes and sharing our experiences to help spread awareness and hopefully prevent someone else from being scammed the same way. 

I'm curious to hear about this sub's personal experiences with crypto scams and figured it could be interesting to see any reoccurring themes and solutions to prevent being the next victim. I'll start by sharing my own story, which is a well-known scam.

I started getting into crypto in 2017 and was dabbling in pretty much everything, BTC, ETH, LTC, alt coins like Verge (Thanks McAfee), etc. I was searching for the next moonshot get-rich-quick opportunity.  Toward the end of the year, I came across videos on YouTube about BitConnect. I was a bit hesitant because a lot of people were saying it was obviously a ponzi scheme. But many influencers were showing great returns and it brought me to a point where I just couldn't resist and FOMO'd into it. I moved my funds into a brand new account literally a WEEK before BitConnect shut down on January 17th, 2018. My greed blinded me to all the red flags, and I learned the hard way that if something seems too good to be true , it's because it is!"
27/2/23,Why the US jobs market can tell you where Crypto prices are going in 2023,"Hear me out on this- I’m skeptical that we don’t drop another 10-25% from here. I think there’s only two scenarios that can play out and we can look to the US jobs market for this. 

1. If the jobs market stays hot, then inflation is going to linger between 5-7% not getting to the Fed’s 2% target and they won’t have that, they’ll be forced to raise rates until they break the job market, economy, and then inflation breaks after a recession. 

2. If the jobs market breaks then we dive into a recession and in a 2% inflation the Fed can bail out the US economy by Quantitative easing but since inflation is hot, they will be handcuffed. They will be forced into allowing the economy to go through a recession in order to break inflation and then they can cut rates. 

In both these scenarios, crypto loses before it goes back into a bull market. Now I don’t know S.A.F. but you heard it here first."

I feel as if no one has ever explained why being a security / being regulated by the SEC, is a huge issue. We all want mass adoption and that is going to require regulation which means potentially being a security.

27/2/23,How often you should re-invest staking rewards to efficiently maximize compound interest - a DOT case study,"If you're staking your DOT with Tasliman, you're earning a solid 15.4% APR on your investment. That's a great return, but there's even more you can do to maximize your gains: reinvesting your staking rewards.

When you earn staking rewards, you have a choice to either take them out or reinvest them into your staking pool. By reinvesting your rewards, you can take advantage of the benefits of compound interest, which means you earn interest not only on your original investment, but also on the accumulated interest.

But how often should you reinvest your rewards to optimize your returns? It turns out that the optimal frequency of reinvestment depends on a few factors, such as the amount of DOT invested, the interest rate, the compounding frequency, and any fees associated with reinvestment. For staking DOT with Tasliman, assuming daily compounding and a reinvestment fee of 0.012081523 units, I found that if you have at least 300 DOT, then you should be reinvesting daily.

Here are the optimal days for reinvestment for various staking amounts, assuming daily compounding and a reinvestment fee of 0.012081523 units:

10 DOT: Monthly reinvestment is optimal, which means you should reinvest your staking rewards once per month to maximize your returns.


50 DOT: Weekly reinvestment is optimal, which means you should reinvest your staking rewards once per week to maximize your returns.


100 DOT: Every 3-4 days is optimal, which means you should reinvest your staking rewards every 3-4 days to maximize your returns.


300+ DOT: Daily reinvestment is optimal, which means you should reinvest your staking rewards once per day to maximize your returns.

Of course, these optimal days for reinvestment are based on a number of assumptions, and your individual results may vary depending on the specific details of your staking arrangement. Nevertheless, these guidelines can serve as a useful starting point for determining the optimal frequency of reinvestment for your DOT staking rewards. If you have less than 300 DOT staked, it may be more optimal to reinvest your rewards less frequently, such as weekly or monthly. Ultimately, the best approach will depend on your individual goals and preferences. Happy staking!

Example, showing increased return (although pretty nominal)
Here are the estimated returns at the end of each period, assuming an initial investment of 500 units:

----Daily reinvestment: After one year, you would have approximately 659.97 units, which represents a total return of 159.97 units over the course of the year.

----Weekly reinvestment: After one year, you would have approximately 657.91 units, which represents a total return of 157.91 units over the course of the year.

----Monthly reinvestment: After one year, you would have approximately 655.08 units, which represents a total return of 155.08 units over the course of the year.

As you can see, reinvesting your staking rewards on a daily basis results in the highest return, followed by weekly and monthly reinvestment. However, the difference in returns is relatively small, with daily reinvestment providing only a slightly higher return compared to weekly and monthly reinvestment.

TLDR: If you're staking DOT with Tasliman, reinvest your rewards to maximize your returns. Daily reinvestment is optimal for staking amounts of at least 300 DOT, while less frequent reinvestment may be better for smaller amounts."

27/2/23,These cryptocurrency exchanges are not complying with sanctions against Russia.,"Since Russia invaded Ukrainian territory over a year ago, sanctions have been imposed on trade with the federation. These sanctions apply to almost the entire Western world, including cryptocurrency exchanges.

According to research by blockchain analysis firm Inca Digital, Huobi and KuCoin are not complying with the sanctions imposed on Russia. Both exchanges are based in Seychelles.

**Russians use Tether on Huobi and KuCoin**

Inca Digital revealed that the two major international exchanges have not taken action to prevent Russian banks subject to sanctions from using their networks.

This was reported by the online magazine [Politicon](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/02/24/two-major-crypto-exchanges-failed-to-block-sanctioned-russians-00084391), which conducted an interview with Adam Zarazinski, managing director of Inca Digital. He said that these ""prohibited"" transactions often use the stablecoin Tether (USDT). The fact that Huobi and Kucoin allow these transactions to take place constitutes a violation of US and European restrictions, Zarazinski said.

**Circumventing sanctions through cryptocurrencies**

According to the article, Russian bank cards are being used on two cryptocurrency exchanges. The US newspaper Bloomberg quotes Zarazinski:

""Tether is often used by Russians to move money out of the country. It is definitely being used by these two exchanges, especially to provide cryptocurrency banking services to Russian banks subject to sanctions. We want cryptocurrencies to not only survive everything that has happened lately, but to flourish...but we also want to fend off bad actors and develop the industry in a responsible way.""

A year after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, reports continue to emerge showing that sanctions are not 100% effective. It is mainly Europe and the United States that are working to keep Russian institutions and oligarchs out of the global financial system.

**Binance denies allegations**

The Politico report also highlights flaws in Binance's policy. The company allegedly offers Russian users ""various ways"" to purchase cryptocurrencies on its exchange. However, Binance claims otherwise. The exchange restricted deposits from Russian payment cards in March 2022.

According to a spokesperson for the platform, it is strict in complying with Know-Your-Customer (KYC) regulations. He also mentioned ByBit, a cryptocurrency exchange based in Singapore, which allows the conversion of Russian rubles into cryptocurrencies.

**The sanctions list should be sufficient**

Jake Chervinsky, a policy maker at The Blockchain Association, explained how sanctions work in the US:

""In the US, the Office of Foreign Assets Control designates specific targets for sanctions, such as individuals, companies, and governments. They are listed in the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons list. Conducting transactions with such a person is illegal for any person in the US.""

Chervensky added that it doesn't matter whether someone is using dollars, gold, shells, or Bitcoin.

""There is no reason to think that the existence of cryptocurrencies will persuade anyone to knowingly violate sanctions, risking fines or imprisonment.""

In the EU, we have a similar list called the Financial Sanctions Database - FSF Platform. Conducting transactions with anyone on this list is also illegal in the EU. But that's theory. The reality is quite different."

But the real best thing crypto can buy is time. Time is thing rich people never waste, they will spend any money to save just a bit of their valuable time - they will go to restaurant, hire someone to clean their house, take plane instead of train, taxi instead of walking. They often don't do it just cause they can. They understand time is more valuable than bit of money. You can always  earn more money, you can never bring back lost time.

So next time you will look at your portfolio or imagine your goals or future profits, instead of money think about time, it is much more valuable. Ability to save 8 hours a day just on not working in 9-5 is priceless. Ability to be always  for your kids or second half without lame excuses like ""sorry I am busy"" or ""I can't I am working"". Time give unlimited power. Most of us can't say: ""let's do something crazy and travel to different country tomorrow"" even if we financially can. Obligations and job limit us to traveling 2 weeks in a year. Job and chores take time we could spend on hobbies, gym or education.


With unlimited time on your side thanks to crypto profits you can easily retire, or you can do what you always wanted. For example you are 40 years old now and always wanted be a doctor. But you never had good enough grades to get on uni or money to study. If you make will make enough money thanks to crypto you could start new career to become a doctor just for yearself, cause who will dare to say anything if you don't need to ever work in your life.


Many crypto investors waste their time like crazy. They spend whole days looking at charts, even if they will money in few years they will realize, they can't get back lost time. If you will use your time well while investing in crypto now and to live your life well enough after getting money you will have all time under your control. If now you sit looking at charts, eat unhealthy and not exercise, you will have to spend time and effort to get in shape back even if you will become crypto multimilionaire."

27/2/23,"are we heading towards a recession, depression, or neither?","Personally I think we're headed towards a recession and we will definitely be in an official one by the end of summer. Technically we've been in a recession for a while now but of course you know certain individuals had to change the definition to not look bad. Either way I believe we are heading towards a recession and these are the following reasons why:

US Recession Factors

1. COVID-19 Pandemic: if we get another surge which is possible and they shut the economy down again we are screwed and there is a huge possibility of that happening still and I don't want to sound like in conspiracy theorists but my reason why I think that's possible is because it was a man-made disaster to begin with.

2. Inflation: inflation is causing people to drive up their credit which is driving up their interest payments which is going to cause people to go bankrupt which will contribute to a recession.

3. Labor Shortages: With labor shortages companies are going to be struggling to create a profit especially if they have to raise their wages just to get workers.

4. Supply Chain Disruptions: Disruptions in global supply chains due to the pandemic and other factors are leading to shortages of significant supplies, which could impact production and ultimately lead to a recession.

5. Political Uncertainty and Possible WW3. The government continues to create really s***** policies that are destroying the economy and passing bills that are bankrupting America. Also, with China and Russia teaming up anything can happen this summer and Joe Biden and his team aren't practicing conflict resolution or even trying to negotiate which is all bad.

These are my top reasons why I believe we will be in a recession by the end of the summer if you disagree or agree or have any other ideas on why or why not we will be in a recession by the end of summer let us know."
27/2/23,"Started watching the free MIT course ""Introduction to Blockchain and Money""","And I was surprised to see Gary Gensler is the professor for the course. He seems to get a lot of hate around here, especially recently. If you were new to this subreddit, you would assume Gary Gensler hated cryptocurrencies, but since he is teaching this MIT course, that likely isn't true (in my opinion). 

Is it still worth the watch or are there better alternatives out there to learn about cryptocurrencies and blockchain? It's a long class so would love to hear others experiences if they have taken the course.

27/2/23,Is there anyway to “by-pass” the trilema?,"For those who may not be familiar, the Trilema principle is a theory in the world of cryptocurrency that suggests there are three fundamental requirements for a currency to be considered viable: soundness, security, and scalability.

Soundness refers to the stability of the currency's value over time, security refers to the protection against attacks or hacks, and scalability refers to the ability for the currency to handle increasing amounts of transactions without compromising its other qualities.

I think the Trilema principle is a useful framework for evaluating different cryptocurrencies and their potential for success. It helps to focus on the key aspects that are necessary for a currency to function effectively as a medium of exchange and store of value.

However, I do think it's important to recognize that the Trilema principle is not necessarily a hard and fast rule. There may be trade-offs between these three aspects, and different cryptocurrencies may prioritize one over the other. For example, Bitcoin is often criticized for its lack of scalability, but its soundness and security have helped it to become a widely recognized and valuable cryptocurrency.

Overall, I think the Trilema principle is a valuable concept to keep in mind when evaluating different cryptocurrencies."

This has divided the community in two groups. Those who only want the Bitcoin blockchain to be used for financial transactions, and those who want more. Some people are worried that this is only going to spam the network filling the mempool memory of the nodes, making it more difficult for smaller nodes to work affecting decentralization, and increase the fees. But currently, the mempool data is already showing that the hype is fading out. It is cheaper again to sign transactions and Bitcoin has survived :) 

[Bitcoin mempool shows the hype has faded out](https://preview.redd.it/njpzy0xnlpka1.png?width=1852&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=884d50bb86cce7572b098561a2e1676091dc81c0)

On a side note, All the segregated witness data that is used for the ordinals inscriptions, can be pruned from the nodes because it is marked as Assumevalid. So it is not a huge problem. Am I right on this?

>Segregating the signature data allows nodes that aren’t interested in signature data to prune it from the disk, or to avoid downloading it in the first place, saving resources.

What do you think? Was this an overall good experience for Bitcoin? Do you think Bitcoin is going to suffer higher fees again? Are Bitcoin NFTs here to stay? Or is it a temporary thing?"

27/2/23,Understanding the importance and necessity of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) trading in a world of CEX.,"It's easy to wonder, why go through the hassle of a P2P trade - when it's so much faster and convenient to use a CEX as a Fiat onramp for crypto.

Here are five benefits of doing P2P trades on sites like [LocalMonero](https://localmonero.co/) or [AgoraDesk](https://agoradesk.com/).

* **Privacy:** When you purchase your crypto from a CEX you will likely be required to register your personal information with that company, in the form of Know Your Customer (KYC). Now that the exchange has a record of all your personal information (Name, Addresss, DOB, Photo identification)  you are at risk of having your personal information leaked through Data Breaches, court filings (Celsius bankruptcy), or Rogue Employees. P2P trading eliminates this risk
   * By using a KYC onboarding ramp you also create a record that will link that wallet to you for all future crypto transactions even outside of the CEX.
* **Convenience of Payment Options:** Maybe you really don't like Banks and need a way to convert Fiat directly to Crypto or maybe you want to use Gold, Silver, Steam Gift Cards, Venmo, CashApp. P2P trading allows you to use basically any form of payment in your region to buy/sell crypto.
* **Access:** Did you know that only 66% of people in the world have [a bank account](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/percent_people_bank_accounts/) \- P2P trading makes crypto accessible to everyone. Even the 66% of people with access to a bank account might find their bank is hostile towards crypto and doesn't allow them to interact with the crypto ecosystem - again P2P trading makes crypto accessible.
* **Community:** By interacting directly with other members of the Crypto community, you might feel like you're more a part of a community as compared to just DCA'ing on an exchange.
* **Decentralization:** Satoshi's [vision of crypto](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) was, to create a new peer-to-peer cash system that didn't require a trusted third party intermediary (like banks or modern day exchanges). By contributing to P2P trades and keeping money off and out of exchanges you're helping to realize the original goal of crypto.

This post is directly inspired by [this comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/119zfxn/ama_im_alex_cofounder_at_localmonero_and/j9pvryu/) from Alex Co-Founder of Local Monero and AgoraDesk. **It was also written as a special thanks to our current Banner Overlords, we appreciate your support of the Moon ecosystem by burning 14,700 Moons to rent our banner for seven days.**"
27/2/23,See you on the moon.,"Well, everyone, it's been real, and it's been fun, but I don't dare say it's been really fun. 

I just came by to say my final goodbyes as I am about to board my rocketship off to the moon.

As I was dreaming last night, a realization came to me..... a vision of my future and laid before me was the path I needed to walk to get there. 

Now, because we are all family here, I am going to share my secret with you. However, you must wait 24 hours before using my strategy to ensure that I make it out first, as it was my genius that made us all billionaires. 

Step 1.  Find an exchange that allows you to buy and sell crypto in multiple fiat currencies.

Step 2. Buy Solana, DOGE, LUNA or your favorite currency using US Dollars (you must purchase using USD or a USD stablecoin)

Step 3. Sell said crypto into CANADIAN DOLLARS.  This is critical, you must convert your crypto into CAD.

There you have it.  It's an easy way to turn $20k into $25k!

Edit: It has been brought to my attention we can increase our bags even more by making a final conversion to ZWL (Zimbabwean Dollar).

This is a risky move and only recommended if you're a crypto veteran and immune to loss and heartache."

I've reported this to Coinbase, but wanted to share it here in case anyone gets hit and blindly clicks through this or anything similar with a hangover or with their brain disengaged:

I went into my Coinbase wallet and at the bottom of my short asset list saw the below '$ [gusdt.site](https://gusdt.site)' entry (one at first, then the second one came through about a week later).

My first (dangerous) brain flash was that this must be legit since my wallet isn't connected to anything, but fortunately this momentary stupidity passed.

I'm guessing that Coinbase named wallet IDs makes it easier for scammers to broadly target a list of wallet name variables like in email scams, in comparison to trying to predict a typical wallet address.

Clicking through takes you to the following, which is when my scam detectors really started blaring:

I didn't go any further. I'm sure this isn't the first or last of this kind of scam, so please be careful folks. As I said: I haven't connected my wallet to anything, so it briefly seemed like it could be some kind of friendly airdrop based on my other wallet holdings, which is probably where they get you.

There was also a weird 'NFT Mining' logo that popped up under my NFTs, though this just crashed the wallet whenever you clicked on it. It was probably intended to send you to the same link.

We focus only on the successful investments and ignore the failed ones. We only hear from the big success stories when somebody put 100 bucks into a small cap coin and made a nice profit of 10k $ in a short period of time. But what people didn't hear about were the countless others who invested more significant amounts like $1000 or $10,000 and were left with pennies.

It's essential to be aware of survivorship bias, **so don't blame yourself for missing out**.

27/2/23,The easiest way to know which centralized exchange is shaddy: Are they offering yield on Bitcoin?,"The past year has been all about centralized exchanges but in a very bad way, we had over 51 exchanges die this year taking many customer funds with them. Over half of that even just disappeared with no trace. But obviously sometimes we do still need those exchange, for example for trading, though you should NEVER go on them to just hold your Crypto.

Even for that we have to identify which exchanges we should directly not trust, we can do that through a look on their history, their proof reserves (that is often misleading though. But there is just one very easy rule of thumb: Are they offering any yield for you to just hold Bitcoin on their exchange aka are they offering any Bitcoin “staking“?

Because that means that they are running an unsustainable business model as Bitcoin itself does not offer any staking mechanism, meaning they likely commingle funds to pay you yield and don’t hold 1:1.

Not just Bitcoin, but if they are offering any crazy yields on stablecoins or even let you stake and unstake ETH (unlocking your ETH stake is only possible after the pending Shanghai update), they are probably just lying to you.

27/2/23,It takes a while to really find the chains and ecosystems you interact with daily,"Do you have any specific chains you interact with daily? What made you stick around?

Throughout the past few years in Crypto, I have moved around from a few ecosystems. I personally started with Ethereum, then moved to Algorand and used Yieldly pretty much daily. However, at the same time I was actually stacking some CRO, to try to get a debit card and the price did a nice run up, so that lead me into the Cosmos since it’s Crypto.org chain is connected to Osmosis. 

Since I found Osmosis, I ended up learning about ATOM, staking and getting a few airdrops the I was hooked. So I’m mostly active in the Cosmos ecosystem still, ATOM (mostly governance or compounding) and Osmosis along with a few other projects in the ecosystem I tinker with daily. 

I don’t use Algorand anywhere near as much, but honestly Yieldly was a fun product. There is definitely a chance that I could go back there and start providing some yield again. And Algorand Governance just isn’t anything special to me, and you don’t earn much yield from it at all.

CRO has a few fair projects, but the user experience is nothing special in my opinion. VVS is fine but definitely not better than Osmosis, so I don’t use VVS ever. ARGO liquid staking is something i still use every few months but the other projects on CRO are either leverage plays or something I’m simply not interested in.

What projects or chains, are you interacting with, day to day or pretty frequently? What made you stick around?"

[Average income for the USA](https://preview.redd.it/62jkkliqzpka1.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e5c2793b2f12c665920b914f8dd4e575d7a42ecb)

Should people that fall in different demographics have a standard for profit expectation? Say a 20 year old (Investor A) who makes 36,556$ a year invests a relatively huge 20% of his yearly income, that is 7311.2 $. A **6 times profit** would mean that the 20 year old investor has made a **one full year's salary** as profit! (Excluding taxes for simplification).

On the other hand, a 45 year old investor (Investor B) with a yearly income of 61,412 $ has put 20% of it in crypto, coming to an amount of 12,282.4 $, 68% more than investor A. They also need a **6 times profit** to make a **one full year's salary** as profit. The difference here is just the initial amount, given all things are equal, such as the level of risks calculated by each.

For me personally, making a full year's salary worth as profit is a much more realistic approach than just a pre-set attractive amount. Maybe Investor A wants to **achieve 100k from his 7.3 k** investment, a **1369 % profit** is required! Sounds much more riskier and stressful to try to invest in the right coin, and being early as well plays a huge role. Investing in BTC/ETH below 25k and some very few altcoins can very much have a high probability of achieving a 600% profit from a 20% yearly investment, and is what I feel comfortable and confident of. **EDIT 1:** **\*The time margin for this is the BTC 4 year cycle\***

I am interested in your views of this jumble opinion and any constructive criticism is more than welcome, and please feel free to share your own strategies!"
27/2/23,"Don't try to apply logic or rules of law toward SEC or Gensler's behaviour, they just do what their bosses (banks and politicians) tell them.","SEC is not some sacred institution free of outside influence. It is just another lap dog of big corporations, banks and politicians. Another leash on necks of hard working citizens.  SEC do what it is told to do. And as we know World Bank, IMF, banks in general and most governments  hate crypto casue it mean less power for them,  economical freedom to average people, less debt for third world countries and more transparent political donations thanks to blockchain. So obviously they do everything to fight it, scare people and they also use SEC to this.

SEC will  try to force any shit they will be able to do, cause that's what they are paid for. If they will be told they will say ""water is a security"", cause who is gonna stop them? Only huge companies like Ripple with millions of dollars to spend on lawyers can stop SEC or  eventually angry mob  protesting. SEC don't care what laws say, what rules should they apply, in many cases what  SEC say become THE law.


Gary is another old man talking shit, cause if Gary will be good boy his superiors will get  pat him on the head and give him a snack, maybe even  promotion  if he will be good boy. Words Gensler speak are not his worlds, those are words of politicians and banks. Which make it even scarier.


So in case of SEC talking about anything related to crypto, we shouldn't ask ""Can SEC do it from legal point of view?"", we should rather ask "" Does SEC have enough power to force us to do it, even if it again law and logic?""
For now they don't have enough power yet, they didn't even win against Ripple yet and hopefully they won't. But what SEC speak about today may become reality in few years if governments will become more anti-crypto."

27/2/23,Critique My Strategy,"**Goal**: Create a bull run hodl portfolio made mostly of Blue Chips with a small allocation for moon bags mostly of low and micro caps.

**Context**

Hi all I been mulling with a strategy for my hodl portfolio. I am new to crypto but not a complete newbie, my virginity in crypto was taken in the last bull run where I was able to fomo into good projects by accident with very little knowledge such as DYOR, tokenomics, Market caps etc. I basically liquidated most of my bags during the bull run. 

**Where I am**

During this bear market, I invested in crypto and blockchain education, portfolio building &allocation  paying off debt and getting a side gig that will mine Fiat equivalent to 5K USD a month. I have not invested in anything yet but I now plan to DCA into different positions. My blue chips include ETH, Bitcoin, Solana, BNB, Matic and Link, planned 2nd tier includes Shiba, Arbitrum, Quant, Immutable-X, Dot, Frax, Kujira, Sandbox and Ocean.

I am allocating 5k towards a list of potential bull run bets categorized as 20x club, 50x club and 100x club which are mainly small and micro caps, I plan to buy into at least 5 and at most 10. They will mainly go into gaming, metaverse, AI, perp dexes, Meme( with large communities) and any compelling narratives that come up. I plan to get rid of them in the height of a full bull run and relocate the profits into ETH, Bitcoin or USDC for staking.

My Strategy:

1. Begin DCA into blue chips on a weekly basis and watch out for any pull backs where I will buy more (Stake/pool anything stakeable)
2. Check when vesting periods end in the blue-chip and buy more after the event if price dips.
3. Research thoroughly on small caps to see which one is building into the bear, where the hype is etc so that I can sell off during the height of a bull run.
4. Farm/Stake stables- As I do research and wait for good entry positions, I plan to farm/stake USDC and other stables so that I gain interest while deciding what to buy
5. DCA into small cap positions when I finalize my list.
6. Find ICO for quick pumps and exist quickly when they pump. 
7. Take profits on a DCA schedule as the coins pump.

&#x200B;

My question is, what do you think of my plan? If it is shit let me know comrades and if there is a way to improve it then let me know. 

Alternatively I could take the 5K planned for my moon bags and get into positions for coins that may have a short run, get in, get out with a little profit and repeat so that my 5K for moon bags grows and I will be able to buy into more positions or increase size of investment. Problem is no one can time the market, too much work and I could get rekted."

27/2/23,Why are the moon rewards for providing liquidity on sushiswap so high? Is this a good proposal?,"The APR is 53%. That is very off market. We already have moon whales and such a huge APR will just lead to the moon whales becoming even bigger whales because people with a small amount of moons aren't gonna bother providing liquidity as much as people with large amounts of moons. I'm very perplexed.

Normally the APR you get for providing liquidity (I'm referring to the rewards, not to the fees you earn) are pretty low...nowhere near 53% for any non-scammy project. 

Also what need is there for moon liquidity?🤔🤔 Will people be able to buy a bunch of moons and then display that on this sub as if they earned them? I don't see how it wouldn't work that way so long as I put the moons in the vault associated with my reddit account."

27/2/23,A Quick Rundown Of What Makes Avalanche Special,"*I see a lot of people invest thousands of dollars (or more) in coins that they don't really understand or know much about. In an effort to combat this, I'll be posting every week, explaining how random crypto stuff works so you're better informed on whether you should invest or not.*

# This Week: A Quick Explanation of the Avalanche Blockchain

https://preview.redd.it/tnywx92vkqka1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=705710efbce5414642d8e5e5e500c886b7dd5cec

Avalanche Blockchain's primary unique selling point is that it combines the best features of Classical Byzantine Fault Tolerance blockchains (**high speed**, **low latency**, and **environmental** **friendliness**) with the best features of Nakamoto blockchains (**scalability**, **robustness**, and **decentralisation**).

In theory, this should seem impossible. *Why?* Because, generally speaking, as the network grows, nodes or validators within the network will be required to handle more transactions and query *(""speak to"")* more nodes before validating a transaction. This slows the network down.

However, Avalanche makes it work by adopting three key features:

* ***Subsampling***
* ***Transitive Voting***
* ***Subnets***

Combined, these features make it so that the number of transactions each node handles remains roughly the same... regardless of how large the network gets overall.

&#x200B;

>**Subsampling Explained**

Instead of requiring input from every validator in the network, Avalanche uses a poll system.

In any given round, each validator selects, *k*, nodes from the entire validator list and tabulates their responses. If the number of nodes in agreement reaches a pre-defined quorum size (*α),* preliminary consensus is reached. To improve confidence, each one of the queried nodes will then perform its own rounds of sub-sampled voting to return a verdict on a particular transaction. Once the number of consecutive successes reaches a designated threshold known as, *β*, the cycles of random sub-sampling voting stop and the transaction or decision is approved and becomes irreversible.

C*onsensus is reached.*

Obviously, this is all performed in parallel, meaning it's all happening very quickly.

[Subsampled voting works because the nodes are able to query each other and offer wide flexibility according to the use case and user needs.](https://preview.redd.it/mhhwakavhqka1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b312fbda22448a571151e1763631f6d9ad7279fa)

One of the things that set Avalanche apart is its enormous flexibility. 

The administrators of local jurisdictions can set their own liveness and safety thresholds in their own partitioned blockchains. For example, you can partition your own blockchain and set your own desired quorum size (*α*), increasing the safety threshold. This allows the network to tolerate more malicious actors, known as Byzantine nodes. However, this comes at the expense of liveness, as a higher quorum size means it will take fewer faulty nodes to halt the network from making further progress.

Important or ""high-value"" transactions can be set so as to have a high safety threshold, while buying your daily cup of coffee from Starbucks (and other low-value transactions) can be set to have high liveness and a lower safety threshold.

&#x200B;

>**Transitive Voting Explained**

Classical blockchain ledgers are immutable but also structured in such a way that every ""block"" must have just one single parent and one single child. While this can be useful in certain applications, the linear nature of the classical blockchain ledger data structure results in higher fees and slower transactions. Avalanche uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for transactions that only require partial ordering (this, Avalanche argues, includes the vast majority of transactions).

&#x200B;

[    Simple DAG showing transitive voting where each vote for a \\""child\\"" block counts as a vote of confidence for all that block's ancestors \(and transactions\) too.](https://preview.redd.it/im10r88gjqka1.png?width=3360&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=47275d27cd3adb599c3a13bd19c20625ee6a5371)

Basically, rather than process the transactions in Block X only after the transactions in Block V and Block W have been processed and validated, DAGs allow us to process transactions in Block W and Block X simultaneously. This is because the correctness of the transactions in Block X relies on the correctness of the transactions in Block V ONLY, not the correctness of transactions in Block V and Block W. This greatly amplifies the network throughput as the Avalanche consensus protocol will no longer be constrained by the linear bottleneck imposed by the classical blockchain ledger. 

&#x200B;

>**Subnets Explained**

A subnet is an autonomous network of validators with its own specific rules regarding membership and tokenomics. These subnets will be free to validate the transactions of as many partitioned (local jurisdiction) blockchains as they want. Generally speaking:

* A subnet can create its own token and set its own membership rules
* A subnet can launch its own blockchains and customized virtual machines
* A subnet can set its own standards of regulatory compliance, for example: 

1. That validators must pass KYC/AML checking 
2. That validators must be located in a given country
3. That validators must possess certain licenses 

Avalanche believes that this vast autonomy will translate to flexibility and adoptability.   
   
 

[Subnets are visualised as semi-autonomous groups of nodes that serve particular partitioned blockchains within the Avalanche ecosystem.](https://preview.redd.it/rogepga1lqka1.png?width=959&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2e0b3d3aac5da9129cbca93ac7b461a011ed577e)

For example, local jurisdictions may want their partitioned blockchain to be validated by a subnet that consists entirely of validators located within their own national borders. The usefulness of this becomes apparent when contextualized against the current geopolitical tensions. The United States, for example, may be apprehensive about utilizing its local blockchain if the subnet validators are, primarily, located in countries like Russia or China. To this end, the Avalanche network will also support private blockchain partitions, allowing governments and organizations to keep some information private and only accessible by a private subnet of pre-approved validators.

Similarly, decentralized applications (dApps) built on Avalanche's C-Chain may necessitate different computing requirements. Larger and more resource-intensive applications that require large amounts of computing power can request to be validated by a subnet that requires its validators to have certain computing requirements. This, in effect, divides and separates the computing burden across the network, so that blockchains, smart contracts, and dApps can run in parallel.

Transactions that do not require a large amount of computing resources will not be slowed down by other transactions requiring huge computing power. All blockchain partitions can run semi-independently from one another because they run on different subnets. As subnets don’t share storage, networking, or execution threads with other subnets, the Primary Network can scale up with ease without sacrificing latency or throughput.

27/2/23,Liquid Staking Derivatives opportunities?,"Over the past months, we have seen trends like AI gaining massive attention across the crypto space, with several Data & AI projects outperforming other sectors of the market.

In the past weeks as well, Binance upgraded its proof of reserves verification to include ZK-SNARKs. This led to speculation around Zero Knowledge projects, causing a lot of liquidity inflow into ZK-related projects.

There are a lot of speculations liquid staking derivatives could be the next narrative that gets popular over the coming weeks, especially with the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade around the corner. This hard fork will implement EIP-4895, allowing validators to withdraw staked ETH as far back as Dec, 2020.

Basically, LSD tokens enable investors to earn staking yields while using the underlying asset to pursue DeFi opportunities on other platforms. 

The top 3 Liquid staking solutions include Lido DAO, Rocket Pool & Frax Share, with a combined total value locked of $11 billion. The effect of the ETH unstaking could spark exponential growth for these platforms, as users can stake their ETH for stETH at a 1:1 ratio, earning staking rewards while benefitting from rewards across decentralized finance products.

It’s interesting to see that the liquid staking function isn’t limited to the Ethereum ecosystem. On Near Protocol; via **Meta Pool**, users can stake NEAR and receive stNEAR to simultaneously accrue staking rewards, while unlocking liquidity to participate in DeFi activities on NEAR & Aurora.

Ocean Protocol has 2 liquid staking opportunities in veOCEAN and psdnOCEAN. veOCEAN can be used for data farming (it's not what you think😅), while psdnOCEAN is used in **H20** for staking or yield farming. I'm doing the data farming💪🏽

On Cosmos, **Stride** allows users to liquid stake any IBC-compatible cosmos SDK native appchain token. stATOM has a couple of opportunities, I recently joined the stATOM/ATOM pool on crescent. Currently, Stride has ATOM, OSMO, STARS, JUNO, LUNA and EVMOS available for liquid staking.

This is an open call for suggestions, I want to hear how others are actually taking advantage of liquid staking. I might just be missing out on opportunities for some tokens I hold."

They have been offering Crypto purchases for some time now, but up until the moment it was usually just the 2 big boys, BTC and ETH. Now one of the most popular digital banks decided to pick up more coins to sell on their platform.

Here is where the interesting part is for me, I for some reason would expect mostly Top 10 coins but the ones they picked up are:

Matic and Uniswap. I found that just really interesting. Matic, is great and that's a wise decision and they also have some things brewing on Polygon... but Uniswap. Not saying Uniswap is bad by any means but it's just odd that it would be one of the first picked up by them.

They're creating a token of their own, supposedly on Polygon. That explains why they're already introducing Matic. I'm gonna do more digging about the coin and what they're actually gonna be offering as benefits

Does anyone else think that it's just odd?"
27/2/23,Crypto is there for everybody - or for no one,"Hello everyone,

ever since I entered crypto two years ago, I read about crypto being used for crime, crypto being used by governments to evade sanctions. Of course they do - and it's part of the deal and ever will be. The main reason for cryptocurrencies and DeFi is to get rid of the main, centralized instance for financial services. And there is no way to make it both secure for the good guys, but insecure for bad actors.

**The DAO-fork of Ethereum**

One event comes to mind when it's about circumventing crypto principles: the DAO fork: 

""*The* [*DAO fork*](https://ethereum.org/en/history/) *was in response to the 2016 DAO attack where an insecure DAO contract was drained of over 3.6 million ETH in a hack. The fork moved the funds from the faulty contract to a new contract with a single function: withdraw. Anyone who lost funds could withdraw 1 ETH for every 100 DAO tokens in their wallets.*""

I'm a big fan of Ethereum, but that is indeed something I'm not entirely comfortable with.

**Same story: chat encryption**

There's a similar discussion lately: chat encryption. Signal messaging service will [leave the UK](https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/25/signal_uk_online_safety_bill/) if a certain law passes, requiring back doors for chat software that will allow to circumvent end-to-end encryption by law enforcement. I wouldn't be surprised if they (due to a lack of knowledge, as always) planned to do the same to cryptocurrencies.

There is no such thing as a chat service being both cryptographically secure for normal users and still letting law enforcement monitor bad actors. Every back door in a software can potentially be exploited.

**Conclusion**

We have to accept the fact that crypto (just like cash) can and will be used by criminals (no matter if it's persons or governments)."
27/2/23,Nation-Level Insider Trading,"How can we prevent an entire nation from purposely influencing the crypto market to gain position? 

Insider trading laws typically apply to the country that the asset is being traded in, but is there anything keeping countries from taking part?

To me this is a huge risk in the crypto space for global adoption. For example, let’s say China wants to increase their share in BTC. They could announce a ban on crypto to crash the price, buy a TON, and then revert the ban to raise price. This could easily be used to swing the value of trade deals and resources, crush a rival economy during war, etc. Why would any relevant nation give the rest of the world that power over its economy?"

27/2/23,Crypto Money Laundering: Four exchange deposit addresses received over $1bn in illicit funds in 2022,"Chainalysis released its Crypto Crime Report earlier this month. The document makes an analysis of crypto crimes committed in 2022. This post highlights the main aspects of it for Money Laundering.

# Illicit transaction volume rose for the second consecutive year, hitting an all-time high of $20.6 billion

This is a lower estimate and does not include non-crypto native crimes, i.e. drug trafficking paid with crypto. The estimate is also a lower bound estimate, as they may find more addresses and link them to such crimes. The basic figure summarizing everything is below:

[Source: Chainalysis](https://preview.redd.it/fy1dleypiqka1.png?width=686&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c038cdf2298954ca051791e53555cdd2309e76dd)

43% of 2022's illicit transaction volume comes from sanctioned entities, with Russia's Garantex being one good example. OFAC sanctioned them in April, but they're still functional. Other notes on the figure:

• This does not include off-chain criminal activity where proceeds may have been moved into crypto for laundering, though that activity can still be traced.

• This does not include volumes associated with centralized services that collapsed in 2022, some of which are facing charges of fraud, given lack of off-chain insights.

# Money Laundering

Money laundering is an essential part of financial crimes, as criminals can convert the funds they generated from their activities to ""clean"" money. In cryptocurrency, money laundering typically involves two types of entities and services, according to Chainalysis:

* **Intermediate services and wallets**, such as personal wallets, mixers, darknet services and other legit and illict services, which are used to hold funds temporarily, swap assets or obfuscate the movement of funds; and
* **Fiat off-ramps**, which are services that allow for cryptocurrency to be exchanged for fiat and vice-versa.

The figure below shows the total amount of funds received by addresses in fiat off-ramps. The blue bar represents the amount of addresses, the orange bar the total amount of cash received by all of those addresses, and the number below both bars represents the USD worth of illicit crypto that each address received. As an example, let's look at the last bar: 4 addresses received $100M or more in illicit funds, and the total amount received is $1,047M, or over $1bn:

https://preview.redd.it/22gwgpcftqka1.png?width=694&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cada25313c15961e93b72c83a61d00c4968169fb

Looking at the last three bars, we have 502+36+4 = 532 addresses receiving around $3.13bn in illicit funds.

Of a total of 915 fiat off-ramps, i.e. P2P services or centralized exchanges that allow the conversion of crypto to fiat, almost 68% went to the top five:

https://preview.redd.it/zdh6hnegtqka1.png?width=691&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=80f3895f272961b1216a27e21366d2442387b0f1

# Mainstream centralized exchanges were the biggest recipient of illicit cryptocurrency

According to the report,

>that’s notable not just because those exchanges generally have compliance measures in place to report this activity and take action against the users in question, but also because those exchanges are fiat off-ramps, where the illicit cryptocurrency can be converted into cash

This is summarized in the figure below:

https://preview.redd.it/x3z7eb5itqka1.png?width=689&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d8b1691455809e09abe778086d2376f76d06c75b

# Almost all usage of DeFi protocols for money laundering is carried out by hackers stealing cryptocurrency

As per the chart below:

https://preview.redd.it/il25mz4ktqka1.png?width=690&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2f329de0a1dbc5db1e401c5ea64d64e1778c611a

One can see that the Stolen funds section is mostly (**57%**) dominated by DeFi. There's the misconception that hackers use DeFi for obscuring the source of funds, but what happens is quite the opposite, as all transactions are recorded on-chain. The take here is that these funds move next to other services, including fiat off-ramps such as centralized exchanges.

# Mixers processed a total of $7.8 billion in 2022, 24% of which came from illicit addresses

Mixers took 8.0% of all funds sent from illicit addresses in 2022. To define these,

>Mixers function by taking in cryptocurrency from multiple users, mixing it all together, and sending each user an amount equivalent to what they put in. The result is that each user’s cryptocurrency can now only be traced back to the mixer, rather than to its original source.

The report defends some use-cases for mixers, namely privacy, as someone can see all of your transactions on the blockchain. In May 2022, OFAC sanctioned a mixer for the first time ever, Blender.io, supposedly for its role in laundering cryptocurrency stolen by North Korean hackers. In August, it sanctioned its second mixer, Tornado Cash, in for the same reasons.

The report sees two trends in 2022:

>The total amount of cryptocurrency sent to mixers fell significantly, and the funds that did travel to mixers were more likely to come from illicit sources.

These are represented in the chart below:

# TL;DR

See the title of each section.

It is impressive that even with main CEXs being watched by the governmental institutions, bad actors could still launder over $1bn in crypto by using them. Naturally this is nothing compared to the amount of money probably tied to illicit activities processed by big banks, but it's nice to have such insights. **Gotta love blockchain transparency.**

Halving takes place every four years and the next one is coming up in March 2024. The halving policy was written into Bitcoin's mining algorithm to counteract inflation by maintaining scarcity and occurs every 210,000 blocks mined.

Over the past halvings the chart below shows whats happened to the bitcoin price. The next halving is March 2024 and if the chart follows its historic path then 2025 could be a gobsmackingly fantastic year for Bitcoin. So while we're currently at the mercy of the bears, halving time is when the bulls feed and are let out to run free.  Ride this quiet time out, the halving is when all the action happens.

A 101 of the bitcoin halving.

* A Bitcoin halving event occurs when the reward for mining Bitcoin transactions is cut in half.
* Halvings reduce the rate at which new coins are created and thus lower the available amount of new supply, even as demand increases.
* Previous halvings have correlated with intense boom and bust cycles that have ended with higher prices than before the event.
* Bitcoin last halved on May 11, 2020, resulting in a block reward of 6.25 BTC.
* The final halving will be in 2140 when the number of bitcoins in existence will reach the maximum supply of 21 million."

27/2/23,The Bitcoin–Macro Disconnect - FEDERAL RESERVE BANK of NEW YORK,"STAFF REPORTS. NY FED

The Bitcoin–Macro Disconnect

Number 1052
February 2023

JEL classification: F3, F4, G1

Authors: Gianluca Benigno and Carlo Rosa

This paper investigates the link between Bitcoin and macroeconomic fundamentals by estimating the impact of macroeconomic news on Bitcoin using an event study with intraday data. The key result is that, unlike other U.S. asset classes, Bitcoin is orthogonal to monetary and macroeconomic news. This disconnect is puzzling as unexpected changes in discount rates should, in principle, affect the price of Bitcoin even when interpreting Bitcoin as a purely speculative asset.

27/2/23,Is anybody even slightly worried about BUSD redemptions?," Nobody is talking about the bleeding of net redemptions in BUSD. We're talking about massive numbers roughly 4 billion a month. Are y'all seriously not following this, or even slightly worried? 

I'm not surprised a post marking house prices in moons hits front page. But, nobody seems worried in the slightest that BUSD is sinking. It's good to see they've managed to make redemptions thus far, but if there is a 10 figure hole, we're not that far away. Does nobody see the possibly for major contagion in other stables if BUSD can't make redemptions? This isn't an algorithmic stable, but a stable that's supposed to be backed one to one."
27/2/23,What good can you do?,"Imagine, as I’m sure you have multiple times before, that its 2025 and BTC is well past 100k. Your portfolio has gone 100x and the green days keep on coming. You’ve played it smart this time and DCA’d out on the way to the top and are now holding the majority of your portfolio in stables. 

Now, most people would be rubbing their hands together thinking of which color lambo they will be buying, however my question is: is there anything good or charitable that you plan to spend your earnings on? What would be your answer to “if my portfolio hits X in going to do right by this person or that organization”? I understand some people here have families to support but investment feels like a selfish act most of the time, so let’s spread some altruism. 

Here’s mine: I got introduced to the world of crypto by a woman who I met while traveling through Central America. This was at the end of the 2021 summer dip and she believed that we were going to see another peak. She was right but she was also hurting. She had family trauma that she hinted at, and a rough upbringing that she alluded to. Her heart was pure but her rage felt wrought from a childhood of suffering. She was kind and caring but she is now suffering back at home with ongoing family issues. 

If my portfolio goes ballistic, I intend on carving out a nice chunk of the proceeds and sending it to her: as thanks for introducing me to this space and in hopes that she can use it to help herself heal. 

How and who are you helping?"
27/2/23,Life changing Gains,"What would you do if you had or came into enough money to be financially independent, would you still invest in crypto. Most people here invested in crypto in order to make life changing gains. If you already were a millionaire or however much is needed for you to be financially independent, making enough money to not have to work isn't a motivation anymore. The only reason to invest in crypto at that point is if you believe in the tech and that there will be a massive change to the financial system. It may be the reason so many billionaires don't like crypto, because they do not need to make more money so there is less of an incentive to invest in it.

Tldr;  if you were rich and didn't need money would you still invest in crypto?"

How do I protect my cash after a crypto sale, and get it quickly to my bank?  Are some exchanges better about having a higher withdrawal limit?  I thought about immediately converting the cash to USDC, moving it all back to a hardware wallet, and then converting to cash/moving it to my back in small increments...  Any better ideas?"

I did the some digging and found that there are many tokens  that have a much lower max supply than bitcoin (and has been reached) 

Xfund for example has 9771 in total - 0.4% of bitcoin of the total max supply
Some people have more bitcoin in their wallet than this has in total. 

QNT has 14.6 milllion. By that logic, Xfund and QNT should be worth should millions right? What are they missing that BTC has?  

Exposure, demand and utility

I think people fail to to understand that demand needs to be there for scarcity to have any benefit. We shouldnt dismiss crypto coins and tokens that have an unlimited supply purely on this reason 

We should factor in the vision, supply increase rate and utility among other things"

27/2/23,Some tips for spotting and helping to eradicate spammers from a small-time crypto sub moderator.,"Hi r/CC, I have been seeing an uptick in spam and scam posts on Reddit lately and I thought it would be useful to help educate the less internet savvy among us on spotting and reporting spam and scam posts on Reddit.

The first thing I want everyone to know is that in a subreddit with active moderators, **the report button works.** It may feel like it doesn't do much but as soon as I see a post with a report flag I start to investigate what might be wrong with the post.

When it comes to spam posts, a lot of them are from spam farms and they have the same fingerprint which often has the following signs.

**Spam posts: (if yes it's probably spam)**

- Did they gain a lot of upvotes in the first 20 mins and then stop gaining traction?

- Does the user history have lost of similar posts or low effort comments about the same product posted by different users?

- Does the user have low karma or karma farming indications like having a history of posting in random or low effort subs?

- Does the user and other users commenting in support of the post have a generic usernames with a shared pattern such as ""AmazingReindeer123"" or ""GlowingPancake4679""?

- Does the post have lots of low tier Reddit awards with relatively few upvotes? *^(This is not always a feature)

Aside from this, there are some basic rules such as:

- If someone you don't know DM'd you it's probably a scam. Even if you want to be polite and respond to an unexpected DM which seems like it might be legit, don't reveal any info or click any links until you're sure they are legit.

- If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. A recent example is uncollateralised DeFi lending... don't be ridiculous. People would just run away with the money if it were real.

- If something raises even just one of the above flags, do some googling and delve into who else is talking about it. If you're seeing no organic looking chat about it then it's probably a scam.

Finally, I'll say it once more. Please remember to use the report button! In a sub with active mods multiple reports always signals to the mods that something needs investigating.

Stay safe out there, folks!"
27/2/23,Buying fruits with bitcoin (in Brazil),"A small town in Brazil is trying to recreate the experimental bitcoin economy that was created in El Zonte, a small town in El Salvador.

The brazilian town is called Jericoacoara. I won't be focusing too much on that, just this: they have a campaign for kids to pay for their school lunch with bitcoin. The fruits cost 10 sats

This bot has performed unbelievably well over the week that I’ve had it, bringing in returns that I never would’ve expected.

So my question is, what is the catch?

In a traditional investing sense, the more reward you demand, the more risk you can expect, but with a bot with such a high success rating, this doesn’t seem to be the case.

27/2/23,"""Real life use cases"" is one of most overused and unfair terms in crypto. Cause for most people only real life usecase is being able to pay with something in a shop.","All talk about crypto sooner or later end on topic of ""use cases"". ""Experts"" from our subreddit love to ask ""what real life usecases does this coin have?"" to disqualify something. But problem is only use case that exist for most of people is payments. For them crypto must be just like a fiat to be useful or worth to invest. And crypto is so much more that that. Also many usecases of crypto or certain coins can't be easily classified in any simple way, crypto solve problems that you don't see in your every day life, but it doesn't mean those problems doesn't make your life harder.

It remind me way of thinking of our average grandpa or grandma that think everything done in the internet is waste of time and you should find real job and stop ""playing games"". You can explain hundred times, but they will never understand how things work nowadays. Simmilar way of thinking have people that talk about ""real life crypto usecases"" if they can't pay with it in the shop or use it to cook food it doesn't exist. 

Majority problems crypto solve are impossible to see in daily life, the same way you can't see blockchain, google or you tube outside the internet. But that doesn't make things less useful or not having usecases. You just need to stop treating ""being used as payment"" as main or only usecase that matter. Many coins solve unique or much more important problem, we don't need hundred different coins being used as a payment.

Also not always usecases mean even good investment and lack of them bad. Nano or Monero have usecases, Shiba or Doge don't have. Which ones are more profitable?  Usecases can be compared to hammer and t-shirt with our favourite band on it. $5 hammer solve o lot of problems in daily life, still people will more likely spend $30 on t-shirt with their favourite band, cause it is cooler.

27/2/23,Things about crypto that everyone should know about,"So I have been in this space for a while now, in crypto terms I would be considered a boomer. Not quite a grandpa yet, but a boomer at least. I have made many mistakes, I have dodged quite a few bullets, but all in all, I have learned a tremendous amount and I think that some of these tips might save you some money along the way. Obviously if you are a crypto veteran these will not be news to you! 

&nbsp;

'1. You have Bitcoin or Ethereum and want to move between exchanges. DO NOT transfer using Bitcoin or Ethereum as the transfer fees will be quite substantial. Switch over to Litecoin, XRM, XRP, many good alternatives that have little to near-zero fees for transferring. 

&nbsp;

'2. If it sounds too good to be true, it definitely is. This might sound like very much common sense, but the scams in the crypto space are getting more and more convincing. Some nasty examples: 


- Youtube streams of a Charles Hoskinson or Elon Musk livestream, the stream looks legit on a youtube channel with 700k subscribers, thousands of concurrent viewers, the topics are legit. The only difference is that there will be a link somewhere on screen claiming a bitcoin giveaway or some sort of refund, signup program, whatever. It's all a scam. The youtube account has botted viewers and subscribers to seem legit. 
- Reddit posts that claim a new Ferrari, Aston Martin, Adidas NFT with hundreds of upvotes and fake comments. These are very popular recently, I saw two of them in the last two days. Luckily our mods get these fast, but there will be some time that these posts are up regardless. Do not link your wallet, do not mint anything, it's a scam! 
- The basics, scam DM's, phishing links/emails, anything relating to crypto please take triple caution and use your common sense! 

&nbsp;

'3. Luckily, to avoid this you can use bookmarks to make sure you don't go to phishing site by accident. If you google search Binance or Coinbase, often the ads that pop up first are fake similar sites like Binaince or Coinbaise, the second you send any crypto here or try to log in it is already too late. 

&nbsp;

'4. In addition to this, use whitelisting addresses on exchanges and in metamask to strengthen your security. This ensures that you always know what addresses you are sending to, and can prevent clipboard malware from stealing your crypto (this malware makes it so that when you copy a crypto address, it pastes their own address and not the one you copied so you send them crypto instead) 

&nbsp;

'5. When selling or buying crypto on an exhange, use limit orders instead of market orders, especially for larger quantities. Limit orders guarantee the sell or buy price where market orders just fill up whatever limit orders other people have outstanding. If there are not many (for altcoins this can be the case), selling a large amount of coin X at $130 each, might make it so your average sell is closer to $127 because there are not enough people selling at $130 to fill your order. Set a limit order at $130, it might not sell instantly but at least you know what you are getting. This gets worse the smaller marketcap the token and the bigger the sale. 

&nbsp;

'6. Free crypto is 99% of the time a scam, but there are programs like Coinbase Earn, crypto faucets, and other trading rewards on exchanges that could earn you a little bit of crypto. Especially useful if you ever get coins stuck on BSC, Matic, Arbitrum, or whatever chain you use, there probably is a faucet that gives you just enough crypto to make that one transaction you needed! 

&nbsp;

'7. Be careful who you tell about your crypto investments. Especially family, do not push them to invest large amounts, as crypto is very volatile and they can easily lose out if you time it wrong. Secondly, if crypto goes well, it could lead to unwanted messages and attention from people who know that you own crypto. Begging, asking for advice, or scamming.  

&nbsp;

'8. If you get emotional from the charts, you are probably overinvested. This is much more volatile than the average investment, and you COULD lose it all. If the bad days really affect you too much, take a step back and consider pulling out at least a considerable amount to protect your sanity.  

&nbsp;

'9. Stay the fuck away from leverage. Seriously. It is addicting, gambling, and irresponsible. The higher leverages up to 125x will make you bankrupt faster than you can say blockchain. Sure, you could win big, but that's exactly what every gambler says before they go all in on red. Just don't do it, crypto is volatile enough as it is without insane leverage."

Meanwhile, on the other side of the ocean, the screws are tightening as agencies take matters into their own hands in the absence of clear cryptocurrency regulations.

On February 26, international political magazine Politico reported that officials from the European Union are beginning to position the region as a friendly place for cryptocurrency firms.

Additionally, it noted that the US Congress is not getting any closer to formulating or implementing clear regulations regarding cryptocurrency assets. It then added:

 “Industry leaders are increasingly making transatlantic comparisons to argue for more transparent regulations. US agencies are beginning to review decade-old rules on cryptocurrency trading and banking.”

Lawyer James Finlan emphasized that Ripple could be a perfect example. If the SEC wins its case against the fintech firm this year, the future of cryptocurrencies in the United States would be very bleak.

**Europe and Asia are leading in cryptocurrency regulation**

According to Stefan Berger, the German legislator who led the EU's cryptocurrency regulations, ""we will have the best legal framework in the world in which crypto companies can develop."" He added:

 ""We will have everything that is needed for a smooth crypto market.""

However, the Markets in Digital Assets (MiCA) cryptocurrency regulations are only set to be implemented across the European Union in 2024.

US politicians are still deeply divided on how the crypto sector should be regulated. On one hand, there are those like Elizabeth Warren and Gary Gensler who want to crush the industry. On the other hand, there are proactive politicians like Tom Emmer and Cynthia Lummis who want to develop it.

Senator Lummis commented that ""the European Union is ahead of us. Switzerland is ahead of us. Australia and England are also ahead of us.""

Furthermore, Susan Friedman, international policy advisor at Ripple, admitted that Europe is clearly ahead of the United States. She said:

 ""We fully expect that Europe will become the natural hub for responsible market participants in the future.""

Moreover, in the Far East, Hong Kong is preparing to become an Asian cryptocurrency hub alongside Singapore, which is already well developed.

**Cryptocurrency bombardment** 

CEO of the Blockchain Association, Kristin Smith, shares the sentiment that US regulators are operating outside of their jurisdiction and targeting cryptocurrencies. She said:

 ""We feel like we're under attack on cryptocurrencies, where regulators are throwing everything they can under their authority -- or potentially over their authority -- and we think that's shortsighted.""

Ultimately, the US may quickly fall behind on a global level. If Congress doesn't stop dragging its feet on cryptocurrency regulations, the damage may be irreversible. This could leave the American financial industry in metaphorical dark ages."

* Inflation pressures resulted in higher bond yields, which had a negative impact on equities and other risk assets throughout the week.
* The recent [Stocktwits Top 25 report](https://stocktwits.cmail19.com/t/t-l-fdjdlx-jlndhjtjy-b/) showed mixed performance compared to the indexes.
* Core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which is the [Fed's preferred inflation metric](https://stocktwits.cmail19.com/t/t-l-fdjdlx-jlndhjtjy-n/), exceeded expectations in January, leading to continued inflationary pressures on personal incomes and spending.

* Retail giants Walmart and Home Depot, along with online retailers Wayfair and Wish, as well as pizza companies Domino's and Papa John's, faced difficulties due to higher inflation and economic concerns, which negatively impacted consumer spending.
* Although there was a mixed performance in semiconductor company performance, Nvidia exceeded both top and bottom-line earnings expectations.

**Introduction**

Now with the market not looking too good and digital currency really taking over the last couple years + only getting bigger in the future, I've been looking into a bunch of companies in the blockchain industry when I came across Blockchain Venture Capital. What BVC is trying to accomplish is simple, it converts your cash into digital currency with being secure and allowing you to do it any day and any time in the world with no extra fee’s.

https://preview.redd.it/lg4pbgcrvska1.png?width=185&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a9cd9e1e9ca5cf694bcf50fc6bf207628c5b06e1

**Macro Trends**

As crypto has been on a down trend as of the past few months, a great entry point has arrived for the next leg up. Blockchain Venture Capital is an opportunity to get in the game while the entry is still low enough. The past few weeks have been pretty strong gains in the crypto sphere.

**Final Thoughts**

BVC has some big upcoming plans in the future and with the instant transaction times at any time I don't see why it can't be one of the bigger companies/platforms in this industry in the next couple years, what are your thoughts on BVC?

27/2/23,Do you think Hard Drive mining has a future?,"I remember back in the day when Linus Tech Tips talked about mining Burstcoin on his server to make some extra money. I thought that hard drive mining seemed like a logical step forward after GPU mining.

Eventually, burstcoin slowly faded into obscurity, but Chia showed up and it looked promising. It was even made by the creator of Bittorrent.
But I don't even see people talking about Chia anymore.

So where can we go from here? Is mining crypto with hard drives stupid or can it actually be useful? Is it just too wasteful and unprofitable?"

This week, we heard that Huobi and Gateio exchanges are launching trading platforms in Hong Kong, with the city investing +6m$ in crypto. It is most likely that the chinese gov is working behind the scenes and might end up lifting the ban on crypto if its ""tests"" on the city come out with promising results.

Now if we take a look at the west, its governments are closely monotoring crypto exchanges after all the cex scandals, especially FTX. The SEC is spreading fud in the market by sanctioning BUSD and actively trying to intimidate other crypto projects , and even exchanges like Kraken with the staking ban.

Based on this pattern, if crypto is going to takeoff anytime soon, its only hope would be the asian markets. The problem here is that I don't think we're paying enough attention to them. Every other news article posted around here usually has ""SEC"" in it.

Brasília, September 27th, 2023 - Brazil's central bank has announced that it will launch a pilot project for its digital currency next month. According to the President of the bank, Roberto Campos Neto, the goal is to have ""something functioning"" by the end of 2024.

Speaking at the IDP Summit event, Campos Neto explained that the digital currency's advantage over the existing Pix payment system is that it will enable payments to be made through digital contracts. This would provide greater efficiency and settlement in various aspects of finance.

""With the digital currency, payments will be made through a digital contract, which will bring a significant improvement in liquidity and efficiency,"" Campos Neto said.

Brazil will be one of the first countries in the world to test a digital currency pilot project, as it aims to keep up with the global trend towards digital currencies. The pilot project will advance as security measures are put in place, with the goal of having a functioning system by the end of 2024.

The launch of a digital currency is expected to increase financial inclusion in Brazil, as well as reduce costs associated with cash handling and improve transparency in financial transactions."

Your stuff is already packed, so you unfold your phone 6 times for maximum screen and go to your banking app. Unlike old times, when you checked your balance before vacation in worries, if it will be enough for the whole week, you are now just checking out of curiousity.

Looks like the work from last month payed off! You managed to get a little over 2 MOONs, which should more than cover the trip. You think about how shitposting was not that competetive in the past, and how you're grateful that you didn't give up, and now have 10k+ MOONs. You are set for life.

Before closing the app, you convert 1 MOON to 69 DOGE, you'll need them where you're going. You say the word ""nice"" with a smile on your face. Funny price, must've been Elon manipulating the markets again. You try to remember how much these 69 DOGE would be valued in USD, but you just can't remember. It's been too long since USD crashed into nothing. 

You open another app, just to check if your avatar is still there. You'll need it for identification when crossing the border. Looks good. NFT flight tickets are also there, so you're all set. Your assistant will take care of the luggage and meet you at the launch pad, where rocket is already getting ready for todays flight to Mars. Life is good!"

Here's the thing: I've always been skeptical of crypto, and have never invested in it before. But recently, I had a pretty wild experience that made me reconsider my stance.

You see, I was backpacking through the Amazon rainforest when I stumbled upon a mysterious tribe. They didn't speak any language that I knew of, but they were incredibly friendly and hospitable. They showed me around their village, and eventually led me to a hidden cave deep in the jungle.

Inside the cave, I saw something that I never would have expected: a group of these tribespeople were huddled around a computer screen, monitoring a cryptocurrency exchange. I couldn't believe it! I tried to ask them about it, but of course, we couldn't understand each other.

Since then, I've been fascinated by crypto. It seems like it's everywhere, and the potential for growth is huge. But I'm still nervous about investing my money into it. So, I wanted to ask you all: what advice would you give to someone who's completely new to crypto, but wants to start investing? How do I even get started? Any tips or tricks would be greatly appreciated!

What would be the consequences?

Article translated for your convenience below, source  ilbitcoin.news.

GENSLER (SEC): CRYPTOCURRENCIES SHOULD NOT BE SOLD FREELY, EXCEPT BITCOIN

In an article published by the Intelligencer section of the New York Magazine a few days ago, author Ankush Khardori interviewed the current Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler.

At one point, Khardori asked Gensler about his thoughts on the new specific legislation regarding cryptocurrencies that the US Congress is working on, and the SEC Chairman responded by stating that all types of crypto transactions should fall under the jurisdiction of the SEC, except for spot transactions in Bitcoin, and those for the purchase of goods or services paid for in cryptocurrencies.

He explicitly stated:

""Everything but Bitcoin.""

In other words, according to Gensler, behind all cryptocurrencies are people who use a variety of complex and legally opaque mechanisms to promote their tokens and attract investors, except for Bitcoin.

This could theoretically lead to the requirement for altcoins to be registered as securities with the SEC, or as registered securities, subjecting those who sell them without authorization to hefty fines. The problem is that very few altcoins may obtain this authorization.

In summary, for the SEC Chairman, only Bitcoin is not a security among cryptocurrencies, and can therefore be freely sold on markets without any specific authorization. Other cryptocurrencies would be investment contracts that, if sold without authorization, would violate federal laws on financial markets in the US.

It is worth noting that until three years ago, Gary Gensler taught at the famous Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and one of his lectures on Bitcoin is still visible on YouTube."

What happens in the very possible scenario where every single Stake Pool decides to require contingent staking? The outspoken members of the community who are against CS have great points.

So I have about 2450 leftover after monthly expenses for food, spending money, and savings. I’d plan on splitting whatever’s leftover at the end of the month between my investment account, and my car debt (47k)

27/2/23,Are Maxis 100% Certain They're Right? How to shake 'BTC doubt'?,"This post might get dismissed for incoherent ramblings.

I don't know if I'm naturally still a BTC skeptic. I want to move towards being a maxi. I already refer to myself as a maxi but I don't know if I'm telling the complete truth. Are maximalists 100% certain that stacking Bitcoin is an intelligent decision now, or is 99% enough to qualify?

I've read a large plethora of resources on btc. I'm still not set on BTC in relation to the human condition. For instance, the general rejection of the unkown by most people, and how easily public opinion is swayed by the powerful in media and our kleptocratic, plutocratic governments. 

Personally, whilst I was in the process of internalising 'not your keys, not your coins' last year, I got stung in Celsius collapse. I had just withdrawn all of my BTC before the collapse (thankfully) but a couple of shitcoins got stuck. If and when I get anything back, I'll liquidate instantly and buy more btc. All of my holdings are in cold storage now.

But I keep stacking sats, and the doubt is still there, what if this is all for nothing. From a personal investment standpoint as a young person, my brain wants to just DCA into tried-and-tested index funds, not btc, as much as I would love societal BTC adoption to continue on an uptrend. 

I wonder if this sort of illogical fear is due to my negative experience with Celsius (I know, shameful, idiotic, disgusting, I hate myself for it). But, also I can never seem to eradicate the doubt, so that leads me to thinking I have some sort of subconscious illogical trauma from Celsius which is preventing me from becoming more comfortable with Bitcoin again, despite the two concepts being entirely unrelated."

If you owned BTC or gold but the world or country you lived in had an entrenched government controlled CBDC,  no more FIAT, and all normal day to day transactions of life (food, transport, rent your salary etc) was only permitted by using this CBDC issued by that country, then how will BTC or gold help you and provide you a ""real money a store of wealth"" alternative. Could a bank of the future simply say “no sorry we don’t accept BTC we don’t convert BTC in our CBDC get stuffed” what then?

26/2/23,There should be no correlation between mining difficulty and price,"Someone posted That Bitcoin Mining difficulty hit a new ATH and I always see people talking about how Bitcoin price Will follow and increase as well. I dont see the connection. Maybe someone can explain what is going on.

My thoughts:
There is always a predictable amount of freshly mined Bitcoin per time on the market regardless the mining difficulty. Why should the market care about the involved mining costs? Bitcoin doesnt get more rare because of It. When there are more miners, the difficulty increases and when there are less miners, It decreases. When miners stop operating, there is no loss of supply. The amount of mined Bitcoin per time stays the same so the amount of fresh Bitcoin hitting the markets also stays the same.

When we compare It to gold mining, its logical that an increase in mining difficulty and mining costs can indeed result in a decrease of supply per time. When its too expensive to mine gold, there is nothing that Will magically decrease the difficulty of gold mining so miners stopping to operate is a real loss of new supply per time which Will make It more rare and can result in price increase. 

The only thing comparable to that is Bitcoin halving which decreases Bitcoin supply and make it more rare. those events indeed showed a price increase of Bitcoin which is logical when there is suddenly only half the amount of new Bitcoin per time available on market.

One argument that I found is that more miners can mean a more secure Network which make Bitcoin itself more valuable. But i kinda doubt This Will have such an impact at This point to be honest. At least not like the price increases due to decrease of supply."

27/2/23,Here WHY SILVER is not going to make you rich but BITCOIN YES!!!!,"**BITCOIN IS THE NEW GOLD!**

The first Reason why SILVER will not make you rich is because probably you're paying a lot of PREMIUM to get the coins, etc . If you paid $28 + $15 premium for eagles for example that means that TODAY you lost $12 USD and probably in that time including the inflation you're not going to recover never again your money because in the future will be more money of course but you're going to have less buying power. **Here an example:**

[Here WHY Silver will not make you rich but BITCOIN YES!](https://preview.redd.it/090spckhwmka1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=01a45d4419c2e9c8a9cc5cf4cdd1bb7d35f9272c)

Second Reason: SILVER can be a good WAY to protect your MONEY if\*\*\* there's a BAD GOVERMENT or the Federal Reserve dedice to print more money, but guess WHAT? All the stocks, bitcoin, real state will go UP including SILVER , so at the end it's not a great investment :/

so WHEN is GOLD and SILVER a great way to protect your money?  
These metals are great when there's a NUCLEAR WAR or something terrible is happening WORLD WIDE or if there's a BIG BIG GLOBAL RESET, but these events happens every 100-200 years or when you live in a country like Venezuela, but guess what no one wants GOLD or SILVER in venezuela because the Liquidity is very LOW so ""few people buy metals there""

would I buy silver for myself?

Of course YES because I like the idea about having some protection if something bad happen in this WORLD but I'm 100% sure that if you want to make money you need to learn GREAT SKILLS, start your business or invest smart in long term + being extremely positive mentally .

When to buy silver/gold?  
You can buy at anytime but the first second that you start tracking the price you'll LOSE time, ENERGY and money of course. GET it but forget about your metals, etc and OF COURSE don't get silver in popular websites like AMPEX, JM BULLION because they will overcharge you ."

27/2/23,Twitter Coins become available to particular users,"Twitter began the rollout of its new support for crypto payments, according to users who started sharing screenshots of a menu that allows the purchase of Twitter Coins with 150 costing $1.99.  


I found out that a soft launch aims to test the product or service in a real-world environment, gather feedback from early adopters, and identify and address any issues or bugs before a wider release. The slow rollout of the crypto payment features follows Twitter CEO Elon Musk’s pursuit of regulatory and legal licenses to integrate such financial features into the social media platform.  


I will definitely use some DeFi tools to track everything related to Twitter coins, after I used Chainalysis, I started getting interested in some relatively new ones such as Toshi Tools, which provides users analytics on trader performance visualized on customizable graphs. A sort of DexTools for wallets.  


Past reports suggested that the Twitter Coins feature would allow users to support creators, with the purchase happening through the Stripe fiat payment processor. The coins could also purportedly be spent on awards similar to the ones present on Reddit, ranging from “Mind Blown,” equalling one coin, to “Gold! equalling 5,000 coins.

In a Twitter update, it stated that Ledger Live was experiencing sync issues with the Cardano blockchain, which returned an error message when trying to send Cardano assets or add a new account.   
 

I checked it out, and within almost two hours of the issue being detected by the Ledger support team, the wallet provider announced that the issue had been fixed and that users should now be able to transact normally on Ledger Live.   
 

In June 2022, Ledger Live announced support for Cardano, allowing users to send, receive, buy, and manage ADA directly. That's when I started becoming more interested in Cardano. I'll definitely keep an eye more on Cardano, and CoinFantasy this year, that's my to-do list.

Creator royalties have taken a back seat in the NFT space as marketplace OpenSea recently slashed fees in response to its new rival Blur, which has surged ahead in terms of trading volume on NFTs in part by charging zero trading fees and not enforcing creator royalties.  


Creator royalties, however, provide an ongoing revenue stream to NFT projects beyond their initial sales, typically a 5% to 10% cut when a token is resold that's why I think that is no surprise that many companies are now being led astray.  


I dunno how will all this end up, I'm currently mostly using Rarible, ReelStar, and OpenSea.  


The chairman of Animoca Brands said that reducing royalties for creators in the NFT space will erode the space’s existing culture and do more damage to the digital assets industry than good.  What do you think?

It seems to me that the TVL hike comes after U.S. senator Elizabeth Warren started to push for an AML bill on DAOs and DeFi protocols.  


Moreover, the top seven DeFi protocols have been in the green zone over the past 30 days. The liquid staking platform Lido has been leading the decentralized leaderboard.  


I believe it's crucial to track everything that's going on with the DeFi protocols, especially these days if you want to have the bigger picture, I started using Toshi Tools to analyze, scrape, and track wallets on the Ethereum Blockchain.

BTC's rally generally sets the tone for the market. And historically, BTC's parabolic uptrend always happened after its halving. The next halving is not until 2024. So where are we at right now?

In my opinion, we may be in a dress rehearsal. Uptrend, downtrend, and sideways movement. The next bull run is yet to kick in.

And perhaps this time ETH's deflationary supply will need to be factored in."

However, such cooperation was immediately criticized on Twitter. Users spoke about the poor reputation of some partners, such as Morpheus and Deepbrain Chain.

Although the Chinese authorities officially prohibited ChatGPT and other Je-chat, Huawei nevertheless declares that it will continue to work in blockchain and artificial intelligence.

This is good news for those who believe in the potential of digital currencies as it shows support for regulating them in a thoughtful manner.

The IMF recognizes the importance of differentiating between various types of digital currencies such as central bank digital currencies, publicly issued crypto assets, and stablecoins. They believe that fully backed stablecoins can be beneficial for the economy while non-backed crypto assets can pose risks.

It's important to note that we are still waiting to see what changes will be implemented within the crypto industry regulatory framework. Nevertheless, it's a positive sign that the IMF is taking a proactive approach towards regulating cryptocurrencies. This could lead to increased adoption and growth of the industry, while mitigating risks for both consumers and financial systems."

27/2/23,Quick overview Tacen,"I am aware that the current market conditions have been unfavorable for crypto and blockchain-based companies. However, after conducting further research on the industry's future growth potential, I have found that the full potential of blockchain technology has yet to be realized. Despite being a relatively new industry, the future applications and benefits of blockchain technology are still somewhat unknown. Some believe that blockchain technology could replace banks, or that one day bitcoin could replace gold. The industry can be quite confusing, with all the different companies and their offerings. However, I came across a very unique company called Tacen during my research. They make everything seem so simple and straightforward, which is a breath of fresh air. Heres a quick glance into the companies dealings;

**What they do**

Tacen is a world leader in providing compliance solutions for cryptocurrency companies and entrepreneurs. The company offers a comprehensive suite of services to help companies successfully launch tokens and exchanges, and to allow traders to make trades more securely. Tacen compliance guarantees a successful token launch within 6 months. Their experienced team will work with you to create a tailored marketing plan that ensures your token reaches its full potential. With our proven track record, you can rest assured that your token launch will be a success!

Speaking of experienced team, heres a look at the company's management team;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/48ujrmgo0tka1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=793e29bff7974c3c1643d0a17d9e39a9a5376200

**Tacen Exchange**

While both decentralized and centralized exchanges have their own unique issues, centralized exchanges are more vulnerable to hacks, data breaches, and involuntary disclosures. Decentralized exchanges, on the other hand, will never offer the same level of trading performance as centralized exchanges. Tacen's hybrid exchange is a unique platform that combines the best features of both traditional exchanges and cryptocurrency exchanges. I love how they address the concern from crypto investors about unsecure exchanges and try and create a solution.

**Tacen Blog**

The company also has an informative blog that helps keep investors up-to-date on news and company progress.

News: Tacen releases a statement on the executive order on ensuring responsible development of digital assets. Read more: [https://blog.tacen.com/article/tacen-statement-on-the-executive-order-on-ensuring](https://blog.tacen.com/article/tacen-statement-on-the-executive-order-on-ensuring)

What are your thoughts? I'm relatively new to this technology, but it all looks promising and definitely seems like it's the way of the future. Tacen could potentially be as big as Binance one day, once investors realize that the company's exchange is a better, more secure hybrid model. The company has several key initiatives lined up for 2023 that have the potential to drive significant growth and I look forward to seeing their progress!

27/2/23,Watch out coinbasers,"I was going to have my brother transfer some crypto to me, and when I logged into my account it asked to verify a new phone number.

Be careful and watch the details."
27/2/23,Stuck in endless Coinbase verification loop for months. No response from support,"I am stuck in an endless verification loop with coinbase. I'm told I need to verify my account, so I try and this is what happens:

1. I verify my passport (SUCCESS).
2. I try to verify my address with bank statement (FAILS because I have recently moved country and my current address/country does not match your records).
3. I try to change my country (FAIL because I have EUR0.01 balance and this needs to be withdrawn first).
4. I try to withdraw the EUR0.01 balance (FAIL because I need to verify my account).
5. Return to step 2 (this is an endless loop).

I raised a support ticket 11346824 in April 2022 and despite a lengthy email exchange, the agents just kept giving me canned responses and directing me back to the same endless loop that did not work. I raised a new support case 14676808 on 21/2/2023 and have not received any response. Can someone here please help. It's very frustrating because I follow all your instructions but it does not work and I don't have access to my funds."

27/2/23,Are instant withdrawals after an ACH deposit no longer a thing?,"For years, with the ""Individual"" (non-business) Coinbase services, I've been able to deposit USD via ACH up to \~$1,000 during the same weekly period, buy tokens and then instantly withdraw them.  No 3-5 day wait.  No unexpected delays (except for 1 occasion, but it was a forgivable mishap).  It's generally worked like a charm and I've been relatively pleased.

My latest deposit this past Friday showed the same notice just before I completed the action; i.e. ""Available to buy"" = ""instantly"" and ""Available to send or cash out"" = ""instantly.""  And I was able to buy tokens .... *but* when I try to withdraw, I'm being informed I can't withdraw anything and need to wait for my bank transfers to complete.

That's a problem. It's a volatile market, so had I known this in advance, I would have waited to purchase any tokens (for a list of reasons I won't go into).

When I go to deposit more USD (specifically, an amount that when combined with the prior purchase is still lower than the $1,000 threshold during the past week), I now see a ""5 day"" waiting period for withdrawing / cashing out.

So are instant withdrawals a thing of the past as of Feb 2023?  Or is there some temporary issue going on?

Been trying to dig for the answers, but haven't found any clear pointers yet."

27/2/23,"When Coinbase launches its L2 network, Base Protocol increases by more than 100%","Following Coinbase’s launch of Base, a new Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain, an unrelated cryptocurrency asset spiked tremendously.  


I've seen thanks to Toshi Tools that the BASE token, has soared over 100% in the past 24 hours after Coinbase announced the rollout of the L2 network. At the time of writing, BASE was changing hands around $3.01, up 109% in the past 24 hours.  


Cryptocurrency investors embarked on an accumulation spree for the token after Coinbase launched Base testnet, as they believe the token is linked to the recently launched L2 network.  


Despite Coinbase stating clearly that it has no plans to launch a token for the newly launched network, many crypto enthusiasts still believe Base Protocol is associated with the L2 blockchain.  


I find this pretty interesting because Base’s launch marks Coinbase’s expansion into the developer aspect of the cryptocurrency industry. According to the announcement, the L2 network will offer developers cheap, convenient, and secure ways to create decentralized applications on-chain."

My balance still shows $85k+ in cash, no open orders, but the trade/transfer limit is $86.xx.  Everything that was associated with the failed transaction two weeks ago is unavailable to me (but showing in my fiat balance).

27/2/23,Does Coinbase have any real support people?,"The phone where my 2FA app resided bit it and since then I've been stuck in a loop of being instructed to verify my account by sending photos of my ID, then being instructed to fix my 2FA settings within 24 hours of logging in, then being prompted to enter a code from my old 2FA to approve those changes when I try to make them (which I can't and is why I'm doing all this in the first place!), and then I get locked out of my account again after 24 hours. Since last week, I've gone rounds with two chat agents (bots?) and now a web support form that only provides automated responses that aren't appropriate for my problem. All of these bots/auto responders are laser-focused on troubleshooting my 2FA app to get it to work correctly even though I've said countless times now that it's gone and can't be accessed.  


Is there a phone number or an email address I can use that doesn't get fielded by bots and autoresponders? Is there any way to get actual, real help? The lack of support is becoming surreal. Any help or suggestions at all would be greatly appreciated."

27/2/23,Not getting 2 step verification code at all,"Hello,
Im having some serious trouble trying to access my account and funds. More than 24 hrs ago i needed to make an online payment. As i went to login on my pc they asked for 2 step verification. Waited for 15 minutes no luck. But my phone was already set as trusted device with auto login so i could login easily on my phone. I went on to pay but now i need to provide 2 step verification code again. Tried multiple times waited 15-20 minutes even before trying again with absolutely no success. I read an article that if i attempt it too many times coinbase usually restricts sending codes so i should wait 24 hours. Now 24 hrs later the same problem still happens. So i decided to change the phone number and verify id. Guess what. Even the new phone number is not receiving any sms. Me and my sister live in the same house and she can login with her 2 step codes just fine. So my internet is not the issue here. I even contacted my sim company and they said everything is ok from their side. Im receiving 2 step codes from other companies without any problems. For gods sake dont give a troubleshoot link coz ive already tried everything by now. So now i have to conclude that the problem is specifically on my account. 

Also i tried to submit a case on coinbase and i get an instant reply that says “Coinbase will only offer self-help customer support in your region.” Now im just stuck in a maze

The case number was Case# 14739528
pls solve this issue asap"

27/2/23,"Coinbase Exchange Takes A Break For System Upgrade, Promises Better Trading Experience","The upgrade was set to take place on February 25th, which caused disruptions to trade, transfers, and access to funds on the platform, but Coinbase assured its users that it would work to minimize any inconvenience.

Coinbase has launched a new feature that allows users to buy cryptocurrency with debit cards and has added support for new cryptocurrencies, including Cardano (ADA) and Ankr (ANKR).

The upgrading time will not affect Derivatives, Cloud, and NFT.

27/2/23,Trying to get update on Case,"I have my account locked again since last week, This exact thing happened in Dec and I was given access back to my account within 48hrs. Currently I only have the initial support response Email that I responded to but nothing after. 

For some reason they gave me the same case number as a December case that was already solved So wanted to make sure they don’t think case is considered solved as I currently am locked out of my account again.

 I always get quick responses on twitter DM and never had them take longer the an hour to respond, even if it’s the standard case is on right track, but it’s also been 36hrs since my last unanswered Twitter Dm. Can I just get an update and timeframe on my account please?

 Case 13926570.   Also should this be a new case or reusing my old solved case? Thanks"

I am just shocked at the way people are being treated. My account has been blocked for a month now. I have provided all the information you need and now no one answers me: neither the chat service nor the email service. I try in vain to relaunch them and I am told that they have closed my ticket. I don't understand. They haven't even solved my problem and nobody is giving me an answer. 

Please, I need an answer from the official service!"

27/2/23,Help Please. Why do I lose money in conversions,"Hello, I am new to crypto. I’ve been trading for a year. Long term trades, and made some money. Although, I decided to do some day trades. I traded from bitcoin to alchemy pay. I pay for coinbase that avoids the fees, but whenever I convert I still lose $2. Can someone explain why? I tested it out and lost $4 even though I was up on alchemy when I transferred it back to bitcoin. When I transferred it to alchemy pay after I also again lost $2. So regardless of which way I do I lose $2."
27/2/23,Coinbase & Binance.us UI is shit,"The fact that I can’t ever find where my last trade is, makes me think the poor UI is designed to be cumbersome at the very least on purpose. Binance isn’t much better.

At least you can flip back and fourth to orders and trades in KuCoin.

What is going on out there with these apps? And also, why can’t I do any Api shit in these apps. Little things like this make me feel like these exchanges have real potential to fail, get your BTC off of exchanges for real."

27/2/23,Quai Snap,"As the Iron Age begins, a Testnet wallet will be available in the r/quainetwork Dashboard.

The wallet makes use of MetaMask Flask and a special snap called ""QuaiSnap.""

An experimental development environment called MetaMask Flask enables programmers to design and test unique MetaMask APIs as well as other features. With the addition of the ability to incorporate customized Snaps, MetaMask Flask functions essentially identically to vanilla MetaMask.

As was already indicated, Snaps enable developing chains to join the MetaMask ecosystem. By using Quai-based dApps and managing their money, Quai Network customers can take advantage of Quai-streamlined Snap's and comfortable experience. Users must momentarily disable the standard MetaMask browser plugin in order to use Quai-Snap.

It is crucial to remember that Quai-Snap and its integration with Flask are presently in the experimental stage and should only be used on testnets. Users shouldn't transfer money into their MetaMask Flask wallet while testnet is active."
