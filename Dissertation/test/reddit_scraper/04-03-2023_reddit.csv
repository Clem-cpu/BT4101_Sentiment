3/3/23,Solana is a Dying Coin,"Solana is a dying coin, it'll never again achieve it's all time high. The only reason it was so extravagantly high in price was because it was backed by Sam Bankman-Fried.

*Bankman-Fried‚Äôs exchange and trading firm had purchased a total of 58,086,686 SOL tokens from the Foundation(Solana) and sister entity Solana Labs from August 2020 onwards. The Foundation said it is unclear what will happen to those assets during bankruptcy proceedings.*

It'll eventually be a gamble token, if it's not now a gamble token. It has maybe one more pump in it, then all Hell will take it under.

I remember the delusional comments about LUNC during it's small hype and how it was gonna make a comeback, well that didn't make a comeback; neither will Solana. Don't waste your time when theres better coins out there.

EDIT: Can't forget about their awful network and the fact that they can't stay online. It's been down 10 times and it's longest was 21 hours!"
3/3/23,What are you telling your wife/family when they ask what happened to our crypto investment?,"So, I convinced my wife to invest in crypto, and things were going pretty well at first. We almost tripled our investment! But then, like a typical clown, I got greedy and started day trading. Long story short, I lost almost everything.

Now, to avoid looking like a complete idiot, I'm secretly putting money back into crypto. When my wife asks how our crypto is doing, I just tell her we're in a bear market and everything will be fine soon.

Oh, and by the way, I also convinced my friends and family to invest in these ridiculous helium miners. Yeah, that was a huge mistake. Almost all of my suggested projects are now 80% or more down!

Lesson learned: I need to learn to shut my mouth when things are going well for me. There's no point in taking credit when everything falls apart."
3/3/23,"Binance was simply the last straw for audit firms in crypto. Binance's now-deleted Proof of Reserves only accounted for 14% of their total reserves, which explains why those firms left the industry soon after.","Firstly, Binance initially published a snapshot-based proof of reserves attestation. However, within 24  hours funds were found to be moved that amounted to almost $3 Billion. I broke that news in [this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/yxtmv2/binance_moved_27_billion_out_of_proof_of_reserves/) CZ himself said ""If an exchange have to move large amounts of crypto before or after they  demonstrate their wallet addresses, it is a clear sign of problems.  Stay away"".

Some may still give them the benefit of the doubt. Then, Binance published an independently audited PoR(by Mazars). This reported a 101% overcollaterlization *however* the asset scope of the report **only BTC**. They reported on-chain BTC reserves of 582,485.9302 BTC at which point BTC was at $16,147 which amounts to $9.4 Billion in BTC reserves(Nov 22nd 2022). *Further*, the previous snapshot-based PoR totaled around $69 Billion(Nov 11th 2022). This means their audit only ""proved"" reserves for 14% of their total assets.

Now clearly, this is highly misleading to customers who only read a 101% overcollateralization and ""fully backed"". Incidentally, Mazars(and Armanino) have left the crypto space 'due to concerns of how the audits are understood by the public', which is exactly my point. Virtually, no one reads the entire report to know which assets are actually in-scope of the report and compare that value to the total assets. Most of the time, the total actual token amounts in the reserves report as well as the total value of assets held by the exchange are not public knowledge and are extremely hard to accurately calculate anyway so this is almost never a viable route.

Again, I am not saying Binance was the sole reason, as there are other exchange whose PoR attentations have very low asset ratios, but Binance is definitely among the lowest. And for a player as massive as Binance and their potential industry impact, that was simply too huge a reputation risk for audit firms to take.

3/3/23,Friendly Reminder For All Those Redditors That Have Not A Reddit Vault Yet To Earn Moons,"Recently, I have noticed that the activity has grown, and there are many active users who have not yet opened their Reddit Vault. First of all, welcome to all the new members and those who have decided to become more active! I have created this post as a guide for those who are active, interested in cryptocurrencies, but for some reason, do not know that they can receive free crypto by participating in this community and also obtain free Reddit NFT avatars.

# How open a Reddit Vault üëõ

Opening a Reddit Vault is pretty easy:

1. Open your Reddit App
2. Tap on your profile image icon on the top left screen.
3. Tap the vault option
4. Activate your vault and follow the steps.

[Step by step guide](https://preview.redd.it/5rosdfm8kkla1.png?width=1030&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fc5a0445021019385009bd35aaa64d181549b8dd)

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Important ‚ö†Ô∏è

A **seed phrase** will be given to you, you must write down it in a paper notebook or two if you can and protect it from everything. **If you lose those words, you lose your vault forever.**

**Keep them safe and not anywhere online.**

Now that you have your Reddit Vault you can get free Reddit NFT avatars and also Community Tokens like MOONs that officially they don't have monetary value but they have it.

# MOONs üåï

Moons from Reddit are ERC-20 Tokens given as rewards for an individuals contributions to r/CryptoCurrency either via posts or comments etc. They can be freely transferred, tipped and spent in r/CryptoCurrency. Moons are distributed monthly using Reddit Karma as a basis for contributions.

You can find an extended information about our beloved Moons: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/moons\_wiki/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/moons_wiki/)

# Reddit NFT avatars

Reddit Avatars are limited-edition collectibles created by independent artists. They are blockchain-based images that also serve as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Reddit Avatars are hosted on the Polygon blockchain and comprise multiple NFT collections.

# Get ready to buckle up and step into the future - the era of blockchain awaits you!

3/3/23,"Happening three time in history, Bitcoin broke above the long and short term holder cost basis and realized price all at one, signaling a reversal after bottom formation.","&#x200B;

[From Glassnode](https://preview.redd.it/0c59wy1d9jla1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dd58d05f10a5842b9a003562c48ce751b58b4d5e)

The break even point for short and long term holders have reached a break-even point! Being one of the most consistent indicators for Bitcoin's history, which act as resistance points during the bear market. From January to March, this bull trap (?) has broken all three resistance points consecutively.

Starting with the **short term costs of around 18 k**, then the **22.4 k long term cost**, with the r**ealized price of BTC of around 19.7 k** in the middle.

&#x200B;

[Short term, long term, and realized price of BTC from bizcrast](https://preview.redd.it/o90hxoqdajla1.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=81c16a1431c440f9399e03be49ef1004b7be9ca8)

It **has happened previously 3 times already**, and 2023 might prove to be no different, with marking the reversal of the bear trend. This can possibly be the phase of crabbing with ups and downs all the way leading to the halving cycle, which can be different than the 2020 pandemic drop that happened (Black swan event) that dropped BTC from 10 k to 5 k if everything goes ""Smoothly"".

This is all TA and history never repeats itself 100% exactly, but can mimic the pattern. What do you think of such indicators and if there are any equally or more important indicators to look at for?"

2/3/23,What is the dumbest crypto concept you heard of that later went on to be a gold mine?,"For me, #1 is easily Doge coin. I saw a segment on The Daily Show about meme coins and it featured Doge. I just did a Google search about it looks like this segment aired December 16th~, 2017. The price of Doge at that time was around .005 per coin. I remember watching this segment thinking that this idea is so stupid that I bet it takes off, especially after being on a big show like The Daily Show. I ultimately never bought any because after checking the main exchanges, I had no idea how to even purchase this coin. So I passed. I was right to an extent, The Daily Show did cause a nice little run for it, and it went on to 2x. 

In retrospect, even if I had bought I know I wouldn‚Äôt have held through the big dip that followed, let alone for the next 3 years before Elon came along to pump the hell out of the price. 


What other ideas have people heard of in the Crypto space that sound so absurd but later on became a juggernaut in market cap?"
3/3/23,A Shout-Out to the Early Reddit Avatar Enthusiasts!,"I just want to say ""thank you"" to the early posters who pointed out the Reddit Avatar NFTs in late summer and early fall. You glorious bastards endured the wrath of this sub's anti-NFT sentiment, and that first collection took months to sell out.

I caught a glimpse of a post here back in August that pointed out that each Reddit Avatar had a limited number of mints: some had 1,000 but others only had 100. I hadn't realized that when they launched back in July. I just figured you could pay for an avatar, and who the hell would pay for one when you could make so many good ones for free?

Well, that post made me think of first edition Pokemon cards. They were on the market for a short while, gone forever, and twenty five years later have been in huge demand. Granted, Pokemon had games, a show, movies, and the might of Nintendo. So, that's not a perfect comparison.

Regardless, I got that feeling, and I picked up a few of the early drops. And now I look at the charts, deep in a bear market, and see that many of the original ""limited to 100"" avatars have been holding their value, many at over 1 ETH, with the top 3 between 2 and 8 ETH most days.

Can't wait to see what's next for the Reddit Collectable Avatars, especially since the Spooky Season collection was completely sold out within 24 hours of launch.

Thanks to the OGs here on this sub who braved the downvotes! I'm bullish on the future of these early pieces. After all, Reddit is full of nerds with collector tendencies."
3/3/23,Dont feel bad about not buying Crypto or BTC early on. You wouldnt have the success you think you would've...,"As the title says, dont feel bad about not buying Crypto or BTC early on. You wouldnt have the success you think you would've and here is why. 

We all like to play the game of shoulda coulda woulda  and do some math about how many millions or billions you would have now if they invested X amount of many into this project or this project but that is just a good way to torture yourself. The truth, it wouldnt have mattered much anyway... 

Seeing the price now makes hindsight 20/20 but the truth is, nobody would have ever guessed the success of Bitcoin minus the creator Craig Wright himself (total joke). There were very few people who had the the belief that this would turn into what it has become now. We have companies buying crypto and new generations of people calling BTC a safe Haven.... that would've been a ludicrous idea a decade ago and yet, here we are... 

Lets be real as well, even if you did buy BTC when it was pennies, there is now way you would have held until now. BTC was given away early on for doing random shit on the internet and then used to buy drugs... Lets be real, crypto was used early on for the silk road and other shady. Those people gettinf out of jail we alwaya joke about, they are the only ones who held this long because it was a forced hold! 

People were selling BTC when it hit a dollar, 10 dollars, or 100. That already was 1000%+ profit, those were crazy returns on your investment already! Even if you did hold for way longer than everyone else back then, there is no way you would've made it past the 2017 bullrun. That would have gotten even the strongest diamond hands to sell. They took massive amounts of profit 

Moral of the story, its fun to look back in history, the pizza story for example, and talk about those what ifs but nobody knew what it would become. Even if you did buy back then, be honest with yourself.... Unless you went to jail, there is no way you wouldve held long enough to make the crazy money you fantasize about."
3/3/23,"After my 1-week vacation in Decentraland, I visited The Sandbox and beat all the available maps in the game. Here is my review of that experience.","After my slightly-disappointing [**1-week exploration of Decentraland**](https://mplankton.substack.com/p/mplankton-explores-decentraland) (DCL), I decided to visit the other popular crypto ‚ÄúMetaverse‚Äù, **The Sandbox** (TSB). To my surprise, there was a huge difference in quality between the two metaverses.

You can read the [full review here](https://mplankton.substack.com/p/exploring-all-22-currently-available), and it covers 25 game maps and has pictures from each of them. Unfortunately, I have a 20-photo limit per reddit post, so this post is just a tiny portion of the full review.

**Unlike DCL, The Sandbox is actually an enjoyable gaming experience**, but the crypto part is still very incomplete (which is forgivable since it‚Äôs still in alpha). DCL is the opposite: its gaming sucks, it's full of bugs, but the crypto part works fine.

&#x200B;

[A map for the Sun Hung Kai & Co company showing you how NPCs populate the whole map](https://preview.redd.it/kcry1rtgifla1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=042c1273ec4f82057a18148fc4047345a7928a8f)

**TSB feels more like a single-player game with many different maps**. There are other players, but they're like ghosts in Dark Souls. You can see what they're doing, but you can't interact with them.

Back in February during the Lunar New Year event, there were 22 available maps to play. That has now ended, so many of them have been removed. Instead, we now have 2 new Rabbids maps.

[One of the 2 new Rabbids maps: New Year in Plunga City](https://preview.redd.it/pu4lpyekifla1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f904e0732119f0e35ef65953954576080d0e1631)

You can see from the image below that these maps can get very big. The image below shows the size of the smallest 1x1 tile.

[From the Rabbids game. This is the map size of the SMALLEST 1x1 tile. There is also an underground section you can't see.](https://preview.redd.it/q1rrqknlifla1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=66982471863b17d2470e948a5b27b6ec644cfb35)

# Maps

Here are all of The Sandbox's land tiles. There are hundreds of these.

BUT, most tiles are not currently playable. This was the playable map back in February with only 22 available games. While the Sandbox is in Alpha release, it will only release a few maps at a time, and then remove the previous season's maps. So you'll always get new maps every month.

# Differences between DCL and The Sandbox

* **TSB is focused on gaming**: The biggest difference is that TSB is very gaming-focused while DCL has a variety of experiences. DCL's locations might be for storefronts, businesses, advertisements, art, and other activities. TSB's maps are all games. Most of them contain many mini-games and quests that you need to complete.
* Even though every map has a strong focus on games, some are still built for businesses, organizations, or cultural areas. So they may have advertisements

[A business map for Metagreen](https://preview.redd.it/mwjhmx0rjfla1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5121b36c232dd29d5c3ed87833e2a879157ad977)

* **P2E**: There is a Play-To-Earn element in TSB. Most of the maps allow you to earn rewards for completing every quest. You can then mint NFTs or obtain SAND as prizes. Some of the prizes are only available if you own Land or Avatar NFTs.
* **Visuals**: DCL has Sim-like graphics while TSB has blocky graphics (like Lego games)

[Every avatar and entity is blocky](https://preview.redd.it/ve7wci5vjfla1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=390a57e88546ad64b0bfd96e97d3bf9f55ca02fe)

* **Sound**: DCL sound is buggy as hell. TSB has professional soundtracks in each of their maps.
* **Bugs**: DCL is super-buggy. I can't go 5 minutes without hitting a bug or major graphics glitch. TSB gameplay is mostly bug-free. But their website and rewards system is buggy has hell.
* **Blockchain**: DCL is on Polygon PoS and just works. The Sandbox is on Ethereum, where gas fees are so high it doesn't make sense to mint P2E rewards sometimes. It's slowly moving to Polygon, and some of the newer avatars and NFTs are already there.
* **Multiplayer**: Aside from a few locations, DCL is a ghost town. There are events (like DJ concerts) where you can hang out with each other and special events where you can pick up free NFTs. TSB is mainly a single-player game. There are some multiplayer maps, but I have yet to experience one myself.

[A larger 2x2 map. This one goes very high \(those gray clouds are in-game platforms\). You can only see 1\/4 of the map in this picture.](https://preview.redd.it/c90m5covifla1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=41267c432d0daeda90d334f0b315116c0fedcf20)

# Game Map Reviews

**Reddit threads have a 20-picture limit, and I have nearly 100 screenshots in my review post.** [**So if you want to see the detailed reviews, visit this link.**](https://mplankton.substack.com/p/exploring-all-22-currently-available)

Below is just the data summary of all the TSB games I've played.

Most of the games are quite kid-friendly and easy to beat. Almost all of them are heavily based on minigames and fetch quests. Paca Death Run is the only one that I found to be very difficult. In fact, there is an even-harder ""difficult-mode"" on that maps where half of the checkpoints are removed, and it was harder than the first half of Celeste.

[Paca Death Run: This difficult map took me 60 minutes and nearly 100 deaths](https://preview.redd.it/4i3sgurzkfla1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=456f78192a1167fbd0a1b0c4c5133026824df008)

3/3/23,"Holding crypto on exchanges is not safe, says Gary Gensler.","Regulatory pressure on the industry is still growing. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler has stated that cryptocurrency exchanges cannot be considered qualified custodians.

A custodian is an entity that holds securities or other financial assets, including cryptocurrencies. This is an official activity that is legally regulated. In the United States, custodians are overseen by the SEC.

# The head of the SEC accused cryptocurrency exchanges of being unreliable. 

Gensler addressed the Investor Advisory Committee meeting on March 2. The SEC chief said that a recently proposed rule requiring investment advisers to go to qualified custodians to hold assets, including cryptocurrencies, brings important improvements to existing protections for market participants. He also noted that cryptocurrency exchanges cannot be considered safe under this rule.

>‚ÄúBased on how cryptocurrency trading and lending platforms typically operate, investment advisers cannot rely on them as qualified custodians. Let me repeat that for emphasis. Even if a cryptocurrency trading platform represents that it is a qualified custodian, it may not be in reality.‚Äù

The SEC chairman reminded those present of the recent high-profile bankruptcies of cryptocurrency companies such as Voyager, Celsius, and FTX. He particularly focused on the fact that the funds of customers of the failed platforms have now become part of the bankruptcies‚Äô assets and will not be returned to their owners.

>‚ÄúCongress gave us new authorities to expand the trustee principle in response to the financial crisis and Bernie Madoff‚Äôs fraud. We will now be able to ensure that advisers do not abuse and lose investors‚Äô assets.‚Äù

# The US regulator continues to take action 

The SEC proposal follows a series of other actions by the US regulator related to cryptocurrency companies. One of the first victims of the SEC was the Kraken exchange. It had to pay a $30 million fine and shut down its staking program in the US. The next target of the SEC was stablecoin issuer Paxos. After the SEC deemed the third-largest stablecoin BUSD a security, the company stopped issuing new coins. And just a few days ago, Gensler suggested that Ethereum also falls under this definition.

Earlier, the US Securities and Exchange Commission identified the cryptocurrency industry as a regulatory priority. It also promised to focus on digital technologies and blockchain. The SEC said in a statement that the rapidly developing industry poses potential risks to investors and the integrity of US capital markets. It can be absolutely said that the pursuit of the US regulator for crypto companies will gain momentum throughout 2023."

3/3/23,When to DCA? Analysis based on the last 365 days.,"Everyone here constantly says we should DCA. But I was wondering what is the best frequency to buy. To calculate this, I took Bitcoin prices from the last 365 days, always at midnight (Pacific Time)

It's not important for the percentages, but for information the total amount in each scenario is $1830 dollars invested. Converted, this means a daily investment of $5 in BTC.

I used the Coinbase fee system of 1% flat fee. So the numbers are also correct for Binance, for example, which has no fees.

There are 3 scenarios.

1. A daily investment
2. A weekly investment always on the same day
3. A monthly investment on the 1st day of the month.

**Conclusion**

Unfortunately no matter what you did, after the past 365 days you were going to end up in the red in all scenarios.

But I do find it remarkable that monthly is not the right method anyway. Daily is the least risk. But in the last 365 days, surely every week on Wednesday was pretty clearly the best day to DCA.

(I did on Sunday this last year, so that was not the best choice it seems :p)

3/3/23,Ethereum staking withdrawals - info on when and how,"Short overview:

There was news today that Ethereum's Shanghai upgrade, which allows for withdrawing staked Ether, was delayed. The previous plan to deploy the Shanghai Capella upgrade to the Goerli testnet late February, then upgrade the mainnet about a month later.

The Shanghai Capelle upgrade had to be postponed, the consensus is now that it will happen March 14th. Developers think mainnet deployment will be about a month later, some think first week April, others second week April.

Compared to the original timeline this is still far faster than expected, right after the Merge I remember the timelines were for late 2023 and that wasn't widely believed.

All of this is based on the assumption that the implementation on the Goerli testnet goes well, there is some slack built in for fixing issues that appear when testing is being done but the expectation is there won't be too many.

If something changes I'll try and make a new short update!"

&#x200B;

I come from a country where accessing crypto is not easy. Back in the days I started taking an interest in the ecosystem, most of the exchanges would not offer services to where I live. I know this may sound surprising for Americans or Europeans, but the rest of the world is quite wild regarding real freedom of access. Then, I found Binance. Surprisingly, they allowed me to invest, even with my own credit card. I won't delve on the issues I had with my bank, who at the time claimed that they were able to cancel or delay any payment regarding to crypto, because I want to focus on the most important part: **when I was finally able to buy crypto, Binance was the only place I could do it from**. 

In addition, I rarely had issues with moving out my funds, and I never kept any funds on Binance itself. Not your keys, not your crypto after all.

&#x200B;

Binance gave me a unique opportunity to be part of the movement towards sovereign individualism. So when I see the FUD against it, when we all know that all exchanges around the world. This is true even for bonds or stocks, are the worst shadiest places in the world. Take a look at the thesis the guys at the SuperStonks have on Citadel and the market makers, look at the Robinhood debacle.

A lot of the posts claiming ""I got hacked"" are total nonsense, in reality, they either fell for suspicious links or made a foolish mistake they're unwilling to own up to or unaware of. Actual hacking, as in compromising your system is a challenging task and most hacks are accomplished through social engineering, which uneducated people are more susceptible to, so it's crucial to be wary of every link you click, where you store your seed phrase, and which smart contracts you interact with."
3/3/23,LastPass hack reminder,"So for those of you who doesn't know Lastpass was hacked last year. Long story short, the other day they released details on the hack. In short the hacker target an employee, they hacked into their home Plex (media system) this got them into the network and they got into the company computer. From here the hacker got the encrypted vault, some unencrypted stuff, the source code, and a few other things.

Something to note is because the hacker took the encrypted files. They can brute force their ways into accounts. It is highly recommended if you use them to change your passwords now even if the likely of them getting into your vault is low.  But this means even if you were securing your stuff with a Yubi Key, the hacker can get in. The key only protects web access, and the hacker and get in through offline access.

&#x200B;

# What does this have to do with crypto?

Many used Lastpass, and even used the secure notes to keep seed phrases and other things. Now while some might try to rail whomever. There is honestly no good 100% system in storing seeds. Even if you do what I do with metal stamps and keeping it at home. If a bad person got into the house or whatever, then they could steal the seeds.

# SIDE TIP

While I will justify someone having their seeds in a digital format. If you use a hardware wallet **never** put your seeds on a digital format. The reason is, you are adding a layer of risk by doing this since a hardware wallet seeds aren't on your phone/computer to start with. 

But IMO if it's a hot wallet, the seeds are already at some risk level. While you will be adding some risk by using the seeds in a digital format. Some see it as an acceptable risk while others don't. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# What should you do?

First thing is first, you need to ask yourself if you want to stay with Lastpass. Do you trust them? If you are OK with it, then fine. But you should still change your passwords and stuff.

If not, you need to ask yourself if you want to use another like 1password or bitwarden. If you are OK with this, then make sure what you use has a 0 knowledge system in place. Both 1password and bitwarden has 0 knowledge which means no employee has access to your master password. Note this also means if you lose it then that's that. Something to note is 1password uses a secret key. Where the security key & master password is needed to decrypt your account. [https://support.1password.com/secret-key-security/](https://support.1password.com/secret-key-security/) (so in theory if the same hack happened to 1 password, the encrypted stuff would be more than less junk data since they don't have all the needed parts). Similar to bitwarden.

&#x200B;

* Next, you should look at changing your passwords, you might want move your crypto to new wallets if you have your seed phrases stored in the notes and stuff, and so on. 
* From this merge your passwords to another company. There is guides out there. It honestly isn't that hard.
* VERIFY you have everything. Once you delete you will lose everything.
* Delete your account from Lastpass. 

Note some things like 1password has stuff built for crypto wallet info. While others use secure notes like Lastpass."

Zoom out here.","There seem to be a lot of uncertainty and even fear created due to yesterdays sharper drop and somewhere caution would be good as there is an actual reason for this dip: the collapse of one of the crypto-friendliest that has a lot of connections  throughout the whole market, Silvergate. But still, while looking on the price structure I can say that all of the fear right now is just over-reacting.

We are basically still in the same range of $20k to $25k and this drop has just put us to 2 week lows which is literally nothing in crypto. Also a drop from our fierce battle to regain $25k may actually end up being good as we can reload some energy for our next push past it with more luck, also it is always good when the market shakes out a ton of shorts and longs.

Here you can see as close-up of the price-structure, and once again it can be seen that we are still very well off and actually if we are capable to retrace this move pretty soon, we would make a high low after making a high high. This is a very bullish price-structure. 

Also further into the TA right now we are retesting the crucial EMA 8 trend-line (green on the chart) were we had bounced off a few weeks ago too.

&#x200B;

I always say that nothing goes up in a straight line, especially not in crypto and that makes logically sense. Now here we have an example of this, we are retracing to have amore healthy move up afterwards. It is just completely normal and sometimes (as currently) even better than just going up in a straight line."

But most of normal milionaires, especially multimilionaires even if behave better also didn't do much to change the world. They earn millions why they workers have low wages.

Do you think on average crypto will be better than that?

People in crypto value freedom, privacy, enjoy new technologies, understand wealth inequalities, but also we dream about lambos and parties on yachts and do everything to legally pay lowest possible taxes. Not like I think paying low taxes is bad it is actually good, but it is the same way of thinking rich people with offshore companies have. Difference is we criticize them for it.

Personally I don't know, I would like to say we will be better, but I am not a fool. People in crypto are often abandoned by society, so them helping back people that laughed at them for your investing in crypto is low. But helping in general probably higher than current milionaires, even  if I can guarantee you some shitcoin milionaires will behave like spoiled kids, waste money like crazy. But also most of them will be milionaires short time. Normal crypto  investors after becoming rich will be probably more smart with their money, but also more helpful and charitable toward community."

You protect your crypto with hardware, but not your login credentials.

I was doxxed by a family member in 2021. A $35 hardware solution I was unaware of could have avoided everything.

It started with a Coinbase login window I'd never seen.

I later learned my cousin screen capped my balance while I was away from my desk. She then attempted to access my account from her phone. That set off Coinbase alarms.

She posted the screen cap to Facebook. We no longer speak, and the personal fallout was sharp & immediate.

Coinbase forced me to get a passkey. I'm now glad it worked out that way.

**Please get a yubikey!**

Yubikeys protect your login credentials the way hardware wallets protect your crypto.

They're safe, convenient, and fast. I use mine for for several sites and added a security measure I should have had before.

It works on PC, Mac, and compatible w/all phones.

Best of luck to you. üôèüèª

EDIT: u/JadioGCity reminded me of something important. Yubikeys don't capture your thumb print. The hardware piece adds a layer of security; however, anybody with your key can use it to access your accounts *(if they have your password*).

Obviously during these times when we are (hopefully all of us) DCAing, staking (for those who can) is the best choice to make the most of our coins, but that actually changes during the bull run.

So for those of you who already have a good amount of crypto in your portfolio and are staking it for some juicy returns, what will you do during the bull market if your coins price skyrocket?

Would you rather sell your crypto or enjoy your passive income? The dilemma comes from the fact that crypto is very volatile and while you might be enjoying these *kind of* *dividends for free*, you are at risk of losing your unrealised profits.

Step Two. DYOR on a few other projects with solid fundamentals, tokenomics, and an active development team and community. Not going to shill anything here so figure this step out for yourself. 

Step Three: Find a few moonshot opportunities. Low market cap, potential hype ability, maybe some high risk high reward mentality, and put some money down. Nothing crazy but view this as a lottery ticket you might get lucky with. 

Step Four: **write your information down and store in a safe place**. Safety of this information is the most important step of this whole process. Get a lock box at a bank if need be. 

Step Five: Tell your loved ones you love them and kiss you goodbye and tell them you will see them soon. Now here's the tricky part... You have to commit a felony that will get you a few years in prison. Ill let you handle this step as you see fit. 

Why step five? Well we have all learned that the forced hodl is the best method in order to get rich in crypto. Those people getting out of prison who dabbled with the silk road years back and looking pretty good right now coming back to a fat stack of money from crypto they had years ago.

3/3/23,Algorand Governance voting session 6,"A reminder to all governors of Algorand that the sixth voting session will open for votes today the 3rd of March 2023.  The measures proposed for the vote are:

Measure #1 - Boost allocation to DeFi rewards by 5MM, from 15MM to 20MM ALGO

 The reallocation of some rewards from General Governance to DeFi rewards has contributed to the growth of our DeFi ecosystem in two meaningful ways:

* It helped move users from more passive holding towards more active participation; and
* It has attracted users from other ecosystems to our protocol.

This measure proposes to boost DeFi rewards by 5MM, from 15MM to 20MM ALGO, via re-allocation from General Governance Rewards to DeFi Rewards.

Voting options for this measure are:

A. Boost DeFi rewards to 20MM ALGO  
 B. Keep DeFi rewards at 15MM ALGO

The Foundation supports Option A.

Measure #2 - Use up to 5MM of the ‚ÄúBoost‚Äù for Targeted DeFi Rewards

*Measure 2 is conditional on Measure 1 passing. Governors must vote on this measure, even if they voted ‚ÄúNo‚Äù on measure 1.*

This measure proposes that the extra 5MM Algo (‚ÄúBoost‚Äù) from Measure 1 be given to DeFi protocols that fit the criteria below, to be used in targeted activities to attract new DeFi users from within and outside the ecosystem.

The goal is to give Defi projects more flexibility in how these rewards are structured and distributed among their user base, targeting rapid growth, deeper DEX liquidity, and incentives for users who come to Algorand in the middle of a governance period.

Projects must provide transparency to the community about how the rewards were distributed at the end of each quarter and those that fail to distribute rewards directly to users will be ineligible for subsequent periods, until they‚Äôve distributed all the rewards received under this program.

To be eligible to apply to receive ALGO under this program, projects must have high enough TVL comprised of the white-listed assets below. Specifically the TVL of white-listed assets, denominated in ALGO, as counted on March 15, 2023, must be at least 500K ALGO. The DeFi Advisory Committee will review all incentive applications to ensure the protocol reported TVL is accurate.

The Algorand DeFi advisory committee has white-listed the ALGO, gALGO, USDC, USDT, STBL2, goBTC, goETH, PLANETS, GARD, OPUL.

The Algorand DeFi advisory committee can add to this list from time to time, by unanimous consensus.

**Approved projects will receive 7500 ALGO for each 500K ALGO TVL as above, rounded down. Rewards per project are capped at 25% of the total rewards distributed under this program for that period.**

In the event of partial distribution of the allocated 5MM, the remaining funds will be distributed as regular DeFi governance rewards.

Rewards under this program will be distributed to projects at the beginning of each governance period and the project(s) must distribute the totality of the amount received as incentives to their users, with at least 95% of rewards initially distributed by the end of the period and the remainder distributed in the following period. The methodology for payment must be made public and approved by the Algorand DeFi advisory committee prior to distribution.

Voting options for this measure are:

A. Yes, allocate the 5MM ALGO ‚ÄúBoost‚Äù from Measure 1 to the Target DeFi Rewards Program.

B. No, do not allocate the 5MM ALGO ‚ÄúBoost‚Äù from Measure 1 to the Target DeFi Rewards Program.

The Foundation supports Option A.

Happy voting, H.T."
3/3/23,Investing At ICO Is Probably Not For You,"Investing in new altcoins is popular because of the potential upside. Generally, however, newbie crypto investors tend to forget that, unless you‚Äôre willing to risk a huge sum of money, you‚Äôre unlikely to make any life changing returns on your initial investment.

I see so many people YOLO‚Äôing $50 into random new coins, hoping to strike lucky and ‚Äúwin‚Äù big.

So, let‚Äôs use the $50 as an example.

Had I invested $50 into MATIC at ICO (price = 0.00263 USD/MATIC), I‚Äôd be sitting today on around $23,000. Is that a lot of money? Sure. 

Life-changing? Not really.

Obviously, MATIC is a best-case scenario, having appreciated by approximately 46,000%. Chances are, even if you DYOR, you won‚Äôt make anywhere near those returns.

With over 10,000 new cryptocurrencies created between July and November of 2022 (that‚Äôs like 5-6 months), I hope it‚Äôs obvious that the odds are truly stacked against anyone choosing to invest in new coins at their ICO.

Obviously, you‚Äôre free to continue YOLO‚Äôing your money away, but you need to know that you‚Äôre simply just gambling your spare change ‚Äî NOT investing. Unless you really believe in a project and are willing to put forth thousands of dollars at ICO, investing in new altcoins won‚Äôt make you the next whale."

3/3/23,Ethereum Shanghai hard fork pushed to mid-April,
3/3/23,How Whales manipulate markets?,"
Whales hold massive amounts of cryptocurrency. Unfathomable amounts to shrimps like us. They can be a person, an institution, or a group of people. 

Some say that number is around 1000 bitcoins but I don‚Äôt know what a reasonable number would actually be. 

There are plenty of ways to manipulate markets. This is how the whales do it. 

1. Sell Walls 

Whales place large Sell Orders or multiple sell orders at a specific price. This creates downward sell pressure, as no orders above this price are being filled. 

2. Buy Walls

This has the opposite effect as a Sell Wall. A Whale can place a massive a massive Buy Order at a specific price. This size of these Buy Orders are large enough to force the price upwards as long as these orders are getting filled.  This can create a demand for the crypto in question and cause people to increase the price they they‚Äôre filling to pay (FOMO) 

3. Dumping

If a single whale decides to sell a large portion of their holdings, it can create a massive sell off, followed by panic and fear which drive the price even lower. The prices often recover quickly, and anyone who gets their buy orders filled at those prices usually does quite well. These are often called Flash Crashes. 

4. Stop Loss Hunting

Whales know where traders are placing their stop losses and they will hunt you down. Example: If the break out target of a pattern is at $15.00 traders will often place stop losses at $13.00 or at the start of the break out in case it fails. The whales know this and know that lots of traders are doing the same thing. They will drive the price down to $13.00 and create a chain reaction of triggered stop loss orders that become market orders. This brings the price of the asset even lower. This is where the whales come in and buy your coins at a discount. 

5. OTC trades

Over The Counter trades allow whales to buy and sell large of mounts of crypto privately and with minimal slippage. These trades don‚Äôt show up on the order books and have less of an effect on the price. 

6. News sources/Social Media.

Markets can be manipulated by spreading fear. We see this all the time in the R/CryptoCurrency subreddit. If you can get enough people to believe a certain event or chain of events is going to happen, it can cause massive sell offs, and even trigger bear markets. 

Hopefully you have learned something from this post. If you have anything to add, or I missed something important.

3/3/23,MATIC zkevm release,"I know many people in the sub, including myself have been high on MATIC for quite some time.  I also recognize use there have been a number of legitimate concerns brought up as it relates to centralization, small amounts of people required to make decisions, recent block reorg, among others.  

That being said, it appears the rollout of zkevm will not only be a positive for MATIC, but ETH as well.  Partnerships are still being made with known entities, which is another positive for MATIC and ETH. I‚Äôm curious as to what could go wrong with the rollout.  I‚Äôm not as tech savvy as many, and don‚Äôt profess to be.  Trying to see the downside of the release here as it relates to price action.  Seems like a pretty solid floor is in around $1.15 or so.  Any reason to believe there is something major that has not been considered to cause a major dump?  I have orders in based on scenarios for protection and profit, but curious to hear what those who actually use the product and are familiar with this change may see on the horizon.  Thanks."
3/3/23,How do I legitimately convert millions to fiat from wallet I found?,"Say I go to a garage sale or found a wallet containing millions, what would be the best way to offramp it to fiat? 

I know the usual process of off ramp is transfer to a CEX, sell and convert to fiat back to bank account. But if my account traditionally only off ramp hundreds of dollars and suddenly process say a million dollars, will they freeze my account? 

Even if we get pass the CEX, as far as I know, at least where I'm from, banks will not accept millions of dollars from crypto exchanges without proper Kyc and source of wealth, and finding a hardware wallet does not exactly seemed like a legitimate way to establish one's source of wealth? How could I prove that I really found the wallet and what if the BTC inside is from illicit activities? Would I be implicated?"
3/3/23,"A tale of corrupt CEO, Ponzi scheme, and market manipulation - the reason why people don't trust CEX","A Canadian crypto exchange called QuadrigaCX announced that its founder and CEO, Gerald Cotten, had died unexpectedly while traveling in India. According to the company, Cotten had been the only person who knew the passwords to the exchange's cold storage wallets, which contained millions of dollars worth of customers' funds.

The news of Cotten's death sparked concerns among QuadrigaCX's customers, who were unable to access their funds.

The exchange filed for bankruptcy, and an investigation was launched into what had happened to the missing funds.

As the investigation unfolded, some strange details emerged. For example, it was revealed that Cotten had signed his will just 12 days before his death, leaving his entire estate to his wife.

It was also discovered that Cotten had used pseudonyms to communicate with customers and had been involved in other businesses that seemed to be connected to QuadrigaCX.

Eventually, it was discovered that QuadrigaCX had been running a ""ponzi-like scheme,"" in which customer withdrawals were paid using deposits from new customers. The exchange had also been operating with very little oversight or regulation.

The incident highlights some of the risks and uncertainties involved in investing in crypto, especially on unregulated exchanges.

It also serves as a cautionary tale for anyone who is thinking about investing in cryptocurrencies or storing their funds on an exchange.

And then people ask why OGs don't trust CEX and why it is only used to liquidate crypto and not hold it by OGs."

Banks, crypto exchanges... they play around with money they don't have and when shit hits the fan it all comes tumbling down (there was a reason governments needed to bail out the banks remember).

With your Bitcoin in self custody, what you own is yours, and all transactions are transparent on the public ledger.

Frankly, I think the crypto market is over-reacting a bit on this one. This bank has been in steady decline for the past few months as a result of FTX and its being blown out of proportion in headline news.

What Silvergate is doing is required by law/regulations. Their auditors require more financial information from the bank in order to accurately file a report to the SEC, hence the delay...are delays in filing with the SEC common? Well, not really, but they happen often enough that its not something to get worked up about. But crypto is in the spotlight so damage points count for double.

Silvergate said that as a result of the crypto shitshow of 2022 that they may be ""less than well capitalized"". What does that mean? Basically, there are five categories:

1. Well Capitalized
2. Adequately Capitalized
3. Undercapitalized
4. Significantly Undercapitalized
5. Critically Undercapitalized

The first two are fine. It means the fed's are happy with the banks capital and leverage ratio and they can carry on. Undercapitalized is not great, but the bank can probably carry on under restricted activities. The last two are bad and the bank may likely have to cease operations.

What we are gambling on is that when Silvergate releases their report on March 16th, what category are they in? Are they truly fucked and have to close? Something tells me that they will come back as undercapitalized but will remain open for business, but their crypto operations will be heavily restricted for sure."

The narrative behind this can be compressed into a sentence:

But there is **1 big misconception** in this way of thinking:

**A whale can still be a whale, when managing thousands of smaller wallets!!**

So whales can still play us in this *rigged* game. Big wallets pretend one way and the ""bigger"" total crypto amount of smaller wallets do the right opposite.

3/3/23,What low cap potential moonshots are you holding?,"Do you own a small bag of crypto that you're not quite sure what it's supposed to bring to the blockchain table? Perhaps you're holding onto it with the hope that one day it will become a top 100 coin and make you rich. After all, many people have struck it big with investments in obscure cryptocurrencies that suddenly skyrocketed in value. But what are the chances that your coin will be the next big thing?

The truth is that the vast majority of cryptocurrencies will never make it to the top 100, let alone the top 10. In fact, it's estimated that only about 1% of all cryptocurrencies will survive the long term and have any significant value. The rest will likely fade into obscurity, their value plummeting as investors move on to the next hot thing. So, if you're holding onto a bag of one of these lesser-known coins, you might want to think carefully about putting your hard earned cash into something that is extremely high risk.

That being said, there's no denying that the crypto market can be unpredictable and volatile. Even coins with low market caps and seemingly little potential for growth can suddenly experience a surge in value, leaving early investors with significant gains. So, if you're feeling lucky, you might want to hold onto that bag of coins and see what happens. Who knows? You might just be holding onto the next big thing in the crypto world.

What low caps are you holding and do you genuinely have faith it'll survive through to the next bull?"

3/3/23,What are some ways to identify and invest in upcoming coins before they explode in value?,"While I understand that investing in cryptocurrency isn't a guaranteed way to get rich quickly, there are still plenty of stories about people who have made a lot of money from coins that weren't initially taken seriously, such as Dogecoin. For example, Solana was worth just $0.51 on May 10th, 2020, but reached an astonishing $260.00 on November 5th, 2021. Similarly, SAND was less than $0.01 at the end of 2020, but had climbed to $7.43 by November 24th, 2021. Some investors have made thousands or even millions of dollars (in a matter of months) from just a small initial investment.

I know it's impossible to predict which coins will succeed, but it still seems like a better gamble than the lottery. At least with cryptocurrency, you can hold onto your investment indefinitely and there's always a chance it will skyrocket in the future (unlike lottery tickets which expire right after they draw the numbers). 

Even Bitcoin started out worth just fractions of a penny and was initially dismissed as a scam or fad, but is now worth over $22,000 ($22,356.08 at this moment to be exact) and reached a high of $64,899 on April 13th, 2021.
I'm not interested in (or willing to) dump thousands of dollars into unproven coins, but I am curious about how to find and evaluate these potential gems, as well as how to actually buy and hold them. I've only used Coinbase so far, and they don't allow trading of many new coins that still have a lot of 0s left to fall off. 

I already have a portfolio of long-term holdings (such as ADA, ALGO, MATIC, XLM, HBAR, and even some SHIBA and DOGE), but I'm looking for opportunities that are just starting out that still have massive potential gains. I'm not sure how to go about finding them (or determining their potential success, whether based off of short-term hype or long-term projects) and I don't even know where or how to buy coins that are not available on Coinbase (or other centralized exchanges). For example, I couldn't buy BRISE (Bitgert) on Binance or Bitmart because they're not allowed to sell it in mg state (thanks for protecting me ‚ÄúBig Brother‚Äù/s).

I refuse to solely be a passive investor and let life pass me by. Surely, not all of these ""big winners"" are PURELY a game of blind luck. Right? But, even if they are, I‚Äôm interested in throwing a few dollars in on some coins, to give my own luck a shot.

Can anyone offer any advice or insights on how to identify promising coins and where to actually purchase (and store) them?

**Update:** OK, it‚Äôs more luck than research. But HOW, WHERE do you actually purchase (and store) them if they‚Äôre not on CoinBase or another CEX? A few dollars here and there is worth a low risk/high reward to me. Just a few dollars I would have probably wasted on Starbucks or avocado toast anyway."
3/3/23,Court in UK orders reprogramming of smart contracts,"In 2022, someone [stole $320M in crypto](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/320-million-wormhole-hack-explained-giap-nguyen) from wormhole, a Defi project:

>The Wormhole is a DeFi platform for exchanging messages between blockchains or a cross-chain message passing  protocol. The platform helps moving digital assets such as tokens and NFTs between Ethereum, Solana, Terra, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, and Oasis.

Now something without any precedence happened: **a court in the UK ordered Oasis, the company that owns the smart contract in play, to exploit their own smart contract.** For 2 minutes, funds could be sent away. The hacker didn't move his fund for a long time, but he used them to gamble, probably to create usable gains that can't be tied to the crime.

**Traditional media now tries to use this as a case against cryptocurrency** and as you can imagine, people without any knowledge start to write about the end of crypto. Dunning-Kruger effect at work again.

All that reminds me of Craig Wright's [ridiculous case against bitcoin developers](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/02/03/craig-wrights-uk-case-against-16-bitcoin-developers-to-go-to-full-trial-report/). As you may read in said media, some people think it's possible to change Bitcoin code and thus the whole blockchain.

3/3/23,NFT Money Laundering,"I have heard a lot that big volumes within NFT space is due to money laundering. Now I understand that it does sound logical to assume that scenario, since it seems absurd that people are willing to put lots of money in stuff that's not even an image but rather link on the blockchain that directs you to the image...

However, is there really any evidence on money laundering? or is it more of a theory and speculation without any real evidence? 

Because after all it could be bored rich people/teens buying them or ones that made lot of money during bull run and didn't know where to spend it so they bought NFT's... 

Maybe it's not money laundering but simply bored rich dudes that want to blow away money somewhere, while having ""fun"" or some absurd reason like that? like maybe flexing online with expensive NFT pfp's and all that 

So is there any evidence on money laundering claim? or it's just a logical assumption without any evidence?"

The fear and greed index as a basic signal :

The Fear & Greed Index from 0 to 100 is a compilation of seven different indicators that measure some aspect of crypto market market behavior. They are market momentum.

How to use it :

The Fear & Greed Index is used to gauge the mood of the market. Many investors are emotional and reactionary ( FOMO? Buy high sell low?), and fear and greed sentiment indicators can alert investors to their own emotions and biases that can influence their decisions.

3/3/23,Top Problems with Crypto Tax Software,"Crypto tax software is a great tool for those who want do their own crypto taxes. That is, until you encounter annoying issues! Here are 5 of the most common issues with cryptocurrency tax software.

1) Missing Data Sources and Missing Years

This is the most common error we see. If you haven‚Äôt linked all of your wallets and exchanges, your numbers will likely not be correct. Transferring crypto between your own wallets and exchanges is not taxable, but the software needs to see every movement of your tokens in order to correctly classify self-transfers. Even if you have added all your data sources, you may run into issues where the software incorrectly labels taxable vs. non-taxable transactions. In this case, the transactions will need to be manually reviewed.

2) Unsupported Chains

It‚Äôs difficult for every tax software to support every new chain that pops up. Often, you can solve this problem by manually uploading transactions with a CSV file. Correct data formatting can be challenging, although the software should provide you a guide or template.

3) Spam Airdrops/ Sh\*tcoins

Anyone can airdrop a token into your wallet. Legitimate airdrops are taxed as ordinary income based on the value at time of receipt, but not all of them are legitimate. Many airdrops are simply spam or even worse, a phishing attempt (‚Äúhoneypot airdrops‚Äù). However, crypto tax software can‚Äôt always tell which airdrops should be ignored. In this case, you may see impossibly high income on your report. You should be able to manually ignore transactions, but that can be a headache if you have thousands of honeypot airdrops to ignore.

4) Legal Gray Areas

Although the IRS has issued a small amount of guidance on cryptocurrency taxation, there are still many unanswered questions. For many types of transactions (such as wrapping tokens), there are multiple tax positions you could take depending on whether you want to be more careful or more aggressive. You may even have a very specific problem, such as crypto lost on a bankrupt exchange. Sometimes, the crypto tax software will let you choose which position to take. But in other cases, it‚Äôs just too murky and you need an individual legal analysis of your transactions.

5) NFTs and DeFi

Transactions involving NFTs and DeFi can be incredibly complex and difficult for software to classify. For example, one DeFi transaction could show up in the software as 100+ transactions. Certain softwares are better than others when it comes to handling NFTs and DeFi, but correctly classifying all of these transactions automatically is an industry-wide problem. Fixing these errors often requires manual review or even legal analysis.

3/3/23,Scanning Smart Contract for Red Flags possible?,"Hi everyone,

&#x200B;

I have a question, given the amount of fake NFT minting sites, I wanted to ask how people can look up smart contracts for red flags in regards to wallet draining and so on?

&#x200B;

I have a mint that is planed for the near future, but I am a bit uncertain about it. It works with a whitelist, so I will not be able to use a burner wallet for it, but only one of my main wallets will be able to mint. I could move all my assets to another wallet, but I think before doing that I will just not mint the NFTs because it's too much hassle. 

&#x200B;

My main question: How can someone scan/look up a smart contract for red flags? I just wanted to try it with a ""Square Enix NFT whitelist site"" that was most likely a scam but I had the following problems:

&#x200B;

I wasn't able to see the smart contract address without connecting my wallet, so I made a burner and connected it. When doing so it only shows the wallet address ad c4fk.....4hkf without any option of copy/pasting it to look up the contract on something like a smart contract scanner.

&#x200B;

When looking for something like that I came accross [solidityscan.com/](https://solidityscan.com/), not sure if this is a reliable source, but it was what I wanted to use to test the phising site.

&#x200B;

Any other tips from people more experienced than me in that field?

&#x200B;

Thx in advance!  


TLDR: Is there an option to find out what smart contract a site links to before connecting your wallet and if you find out the contract address, how can you scan it for red flags like with a virus scan for blockchain?"

Ok I doubt there‚Äôll be a solution to this issue, but this is a problem online. 

That being said, let‚Äôs begin:

#ISSUE 

Now I have wanted to pay with crypto twice in my days, and both I couldn‚Äôt. One on chess.com I wanted to pay for the subscription, and they accept crypto.

Now my issue is you need a coinbase account to pay, which is beyond stupid. The issue is if I don‚Äôt have coinbase, I can‚Äôt pay with crypto? This isn‚Äôt the only one.

On Ledger.com you can pay with crypto, but you need bitpay or crypto.com to pay. How dumb is that, I‚Äôm sorry but this is a serious issue.

If I was new to crypto, and I heard in order to shop online for every different service I need a different account on different wallet apps, I‚Äôd stay away from crypto.

Now I know if you pay physical you can just scan a QR code and send crypto. 

But online is a whole different story, is there a solution to this? 

And also I‚Äôm 17, so I literally can‚Äôt use bitpay, coinbase, crypto.com or any of these services. 

So I can‚Äôt even pay with crypto online.

#QUESTION

Is there a solution? If so I‚Äôd love to hear them, and is there any way I can buy ledger gift cards? I don‚Äôt want to pay with cash."

3/3/23,Was this time actually different? If we look from each Halving until the next halving the price structure is actually very similar‚Ä¶,"One way that is often used to basically describe time through crucial events, are the Bitcoin Halvings. Events where the block reward of BTC gets reduced by 50% thus the inflation of Bitcoin also falls, this time inflation will even fall below the 1% mark. Often we say that in a bear market we are just waiting for the next Halving as that could most likely bring in a new rally.

Especially this time there has been calls that ‚Äúit is very different‚Äú than during previous times as we had recessions and other macro events happening for the first time in Cryptos but if we solely look at the price structure there has been some big similarities to previous Halving cycles.

Here we can see how the price has played out since each Halving until the next one. Here we can see that just everytime we had a massive bull run happening a few months after the halving, then slowly after about 500 days we had the bull run exhausting and a bear market setting in.

Interestingly each time the bear market bottom has been getting later and later in the timeline, in 2018 it was later than in 2015 and now in 2022 it is later than in 2018 too as we made fresh lows at $15k after it. On the other hand the return to a rally after the bottom has been coming quicker. In 2018 it was before 2015 and now in 2023 it was quicker than in 2018 at the timeline.

What do you think, do the similarities have something to do with a never-ending cycle of greed and depression?"

3/3/23,Is your data the new trend in crypto?,"Much of the crypto world seems to revolve around cycles. Where things come in hot then seem to fade out of the spotlight:

* NFTs
* Gaming / Metaverse
* Layer 2 / Eth Killers
* Zero Knowledge Proofs

All those have come in strong and while they still linger they aren't quite as strong as before.

What I have noticed now is a new trend or push towards something likening to a Digital ID. Many of the new dapps that are rising and topping the charts in the Defi space have to do with streamlining the defi experience through a what they're calling a defi ID / Citizenship / Credentials. Basically... your data.

To me it seems like people have thought, where do the big tech companies make money? Off our data is the answer. So now we have a whole new push of companies getting into the forefront of getting you to have your data with them but adding a ""web3"" ""decentralized"" twist to it. I know this is a very basic view of it but it's just a first impression while things are still young and developing. 

Here's some examples of what I mean:

**Hooked**: *Aiming at onboarding developers and applications onto the world of Web3, Hooked is developing middlewares, including one-login DID solution, built-in wallet infrastructure, and social graph integrated interface etc., as the integrated onboarding system.* 

**CyberConnect**: *CyberConnect is a decentralized social network protocol that helps Web3 applications bootstrap network effects. It empowers users to truly own their social identities, contents, and connections in a social network and provides developers with a rich set of tools to build applications with meaningful social experiences.* 

**Galxy**: *Galxe is the leading Web3 credential data network in the world. A collaborative credential infrastructure enabling brands and developers to engage communities and build robust products in Web3. (Formerly Project Galaxy)* 

**Lifeform**:  *Lifeform is positioned as the open solution platform of Decentralized Identification that can bring the next billion new users into the web3 world. Specifically, Lifeform will enable them to come into the world of metaverse and web3 applications by simplifying the creation, usage, and management of virtual identities - their virtual human avatars*

Even Polygon, the Layer 2 is building upon this idea of Web3 credentials.

**Polygon**: First trustless implementation of verifiable credentials  
in Web3 [https://www.polygon.technology/polygon-id](https://www.polygon.technology/polygon-id)



Some of these have just been released in February and others have been in development since October 2022. So it is something that has been up and coming for a bit of time

But in conclusion, they want your data. I'm not saying any of these are malicious or not. Mostly they seem to be wanting to build an ecosystem that will ensure you stick to their platform. Now if they intend to use your data for anything beyond that is beyond me.

What do others around here think about it?

tldr; projects to get your data and make a digital id are popping up, there may be some growth for companies doing this"
3/3/23,The easiest way to survive a bear market is to just invest as much as you can afford to lose. If you already did that you probably had nothing to fear in this bear market.,"Many always seem to be full of fear after hearing about a possible ‚Äúbear market‚Äú, even I was during the very beginning but just as we moved on and on I realised that for some the bear market was just very easy, including for me. The reason for that may be very simple but yet very effective too: Investing only what you can afford to lose, in the first place.

You may have heard this a lot of times already but a bear market is when you realise why that was so important. If your investments did not include money amounts that were crucial to you it all just seems a like a small ‚Äúbonus‚Äú portfolio or even passive income, so you wont care much about price movements, especially in the short-term.

‚ÄúOnly invest what you can afford to lose‚Äú is often said but many actually don‚Äòt do that and instead invest their life-savings or just more money into it than needed out of the Fear Of Missing Out or because you are on the illogical search for the next ‚Äúget rich quick‚Äú coin.

This chart also shows that right now about 5.9M of all coins are in loss and during the peak of the bear market it was even over 10M coins of the supply at loss, meaning the majority were in loss. And also this is just about how much of the supply is in loss thus includes mostly whale balances that bought early for retail like us this would seem way different.

But no matter how much in loss you would be with a long-term mindset, an actual confidence in the project and only investing what you can afford to lose it would all have no effect on you."

I‚Äôve been using it for a few months and I basically only use this site to swap around crypto now. It‚Äôs by far the quickest and easiest option if you have your crypto in your own wallet (as opposed to already on an exchange‚Ä¶and my opinion on that is to of course, always remember‚Ä¶not your keys, not your crypto).

If you haven‚Äôt heard of it, FixedFloat is a non-custodial, automated exchange platform with Lightning network support that allows you to swap cryptocurrencies instantly and anonymously (no login or KYC required). You only need to enter your receiving address and send your crypto to the provided address. The exchange is usually completed in minutes, depending on the number of confirmations needed and the speed of those confirmations.

I myself have used FixedFloat many times to swap small amounts of crypto around, lately to buy some reddit avatars. I have never had a single issue while using the service, so I have never had to use their support. But they are available 24/7 via chat or email and also have a Twitter and Telegram option if ever needed.

I definitely recommend checking out FixedFloat if you have never heard of it. Their fees are pretty minimal (I use the float option which is a .05% fee + network fees), the transactions are as anonymous as possible and are often completed very fast. 10/10 in my book!

3/3/23,"Thanks to my involvement in the world of crypto, I've managed to kick my habit of wasting money.","For the longest time i'd get to the end of the month with no money left and usually in a overdraft deficit. When I got into crypto a few years ago it made me see just how much money I've wasted over the years, and has inspired me to become more financially responsible.

Nowadays, I'm much more mindful about my spending. Before making a purchase, I ask myself whether it's a necessity or a luxury. This simple change in mindset has made a huge difference in my life. I've stopped buying so much unnecessary stuff that I would have otherwise thought nothing of. Instead, I'm channeling my money into things that really matter - like investing in my future.

It's hard to describe exactly what it is about crypto that's been so grounding for me. Maybe it's the knowledge that I'm investing in something that has the potential to change the world. Or maybe it's just the sense of control that comes with having a well-managed portfolio. Whatever the reason, I'm extremely grateful to be part of this exciting and ever-evolving market. Even though some people say we're in a bear market, I'm still optimistic about the future of crypto and the opportunities it holds."

Here's what I think could happen.

Governments are trying to kill the cryptocurrency industry little by little with attacks for several weeks in America for example. Other governments will take the same actions.

Then, governments will tell the people that the world has evolved and it is obvious that you need a digital currency. You will say: but we already have Bitcoin!

Governments will tell the general public that only a state-controlled and state-issued digital currency will protect you. This is a lie, but unfortunately, a majority of the general public will believe it.

However, little by little, it will become obvious that these CBDCs are just a trap for people.

More and more people will refuse to use these CBDCs. Governments will then try to force them on you. How? By trying to attack Bitcoin, of course, but also by gradually withdrawing cash to force you to use their CBDCs.

Over time, CBDCs will become mandatory.

Those who have not taken care to put the fruits of their labor in the most secure decentralized network in the world will find themselves without options, forced to give in to governments and central bankers.

Think this scenario is dystopian? Look at what is happening in Nigeria with the eNaira...

Then you will see that one reality is already apparent: it is essential to buy Bitcoin while we still can. Sooner or later, governments will try to ban you from doing so in order to force you to use their CBDCs.

3/3/23,A TLDR on the upcoming Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade this month,"*Edit: The Upgrade is now scheduled for April. This was written before the updated schedule info broke yesterday.*

The basic idea is the Shanghai Upgrade is meant to be a completion of the Merge,the yang to the Merge's yin so to speak. Initially, the Merge was meant to move to proof of stake(among other things) as well as allow stakers to stake as well as withdraw(EIP-4895), with the general idea/effect being to lower gas prices. The ability to withdraw your stake was however later reserved for the Shanghai upgrade, which is why, as we know now, validators/stakers' funds are locked up post-Merge.

On the more technical-ish side, the Shanghai upgrade is also meant to:

* [i](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3855)mplement the ""Push0"" that code lowers gas costs for developers(EIP-3855)
* limit the gas cost for developers when using the smart contract code ‚Äòinitcode‚Äô (EIP-3860)
* deprecate/dissuade developers use of ‚ÄúSELFDESTRUCT,‚Äù a code used to reduce gas fees that is being phased out(EIP-6049)

*Very generally*, more efficient code means less blockchain work is required, which means lower gas fees and hence transaction fees.

The unspecified lock-up period post-Merge has catapulted the rise of many decentralized liquid staking solutions such as Lido and Rocketpool that allowed validators to stake and unstake ""at will"". These staking solutions function as alternatives to some validators who may be unwilling to a lock up funds for some unspecified period of time.

Outside of technology, there are some expectations upon the Upgrade. More theoretical than concrete, the Upgrade is also expected by some to encourage/increase usage of Ethereum for individuals who would like to stake and gives an alternative to using ""more risky"" smart contracts and staking solutions. There is [an analysis](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/04/on-staking-pools-and-staking-derivatives) that the Shanghai Upgrade allowing withdrawals for staking can boost the amount of staked ETH to 80%  or more but this is very theoretical and at least mildly speculative. That said, the ability to withdraw will almost certain increase the amount of validators. The Eth staking ratio, the percentage of supply staked, is at 14%, far behind the 39% and 44% of Polygon and Polkadot, and much further behind the 72% of Cardano(BNB is somehow at 97% but they are a bit different and unfair to compare).

Here is a visual of the Ethereum development schedule and current progress.

3/3/23,Ethereum Network Activity Stats all trend downward as the Network ramps up to Shanghai Upgrade,"The Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade is slated for April 2023, meaning it is nigh upon us. In the wake of this, Ethereum Network statistics have been seeing interesting moves possibly in anticipation of this upgrade. As a broad rule, statistics that measure the network activity have all been trending downward.

The following statistics are for the past 3 months of network activity.

&#x200B;

1. Ethereum Network Utilization is trending downward which implies decreasing usage of the network as a whole.

https://preview.redd.it/5akppdxbtcla1.png?width=990&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=57038850674fc783a3555512dd7aa7a32677b226

2. Ethereum Blocks per day is implying, again,  a fall in network activity by users. This is such that there are less users attempting transactions so that there are less blocks required to be produced to fit the smaller amount of transactions.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lght39w3ucla1.png?width=997&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=63eb01b9c153bc65ac71a86ab6fd00254570657c

3. The Gas Used Per Day is also showing that there are less transactions/activity, as each transaction cost gas, so less gas used mean less transactions/network transfers.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2fe6by7jucla1.png?width=1031&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1f7f986882c688dd61fbc31c515f0a0493c3bd6f

4. The amount of daily active address also has also been declining such that the amount of individuals who would normally use the ETH network falls.

In addition, **new** ERC-20 addresses has also been falling, such that the amount of users who create new addresses/wallets on the network every day has also fallen.

The decentralized token, DAI, from MakerDAO is now the fourth-largest with half the supply of BUSD, totaling a market capitalization of $5 billion. As a result of the significant loss of investors, Tether (USDT) has increased its market share to 52%.

The main reason some members of the community have decided to abandon BUSD is the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On February 13, the entity decided to take action against the issuer of the Binance stablecoin, Paxos.

As expected, the federal regulator classified BUSD as a security, even though assets of this category have not yet been officially and legally classified as such.

As a result of this decision, the New York-based firm announced that it would end the further issuance of BUSD tokens.

# Binance is not threatened

According to Ilan Solot, the Director of Digital Assets, the current capital outflow faced by BUSD may affect Binance's financial results.

>""This will likely hurt Binance's financials, as BUSD is a significant part of their business,"" Solot said.

David Moreno Darocas, Head of Research at CryptoCompare, commented on the issue, stating:

>""If Binance is indeed generating 90% of its revenue from transaction fees, then it is likely that the decrease in overall volume will be a burden on the exchange's revenue.""

Furthermore, Coinbase has announced that it will also remove the token from its portfolio. They believe that the stablecoin no longer meets the standards required by the exchange.

Industry observers suggest that the current situation is nothing but an indirect attack on Binance. In their view, it is caused by US regulators who are increasingly playing hardball against cryptocurrency-focused businesses.

However, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao insists that BUSD was never a key business in terms of platform profitability. He added that Binance intends to support as many other stablecoins as possible.

Amidst these events, Binance's BNB token dropped 4% in the last week, reaching below $300 during Thursday's trading session.

# Binance NFT pilot project

In parallel with the BUSD stablecoin problems, Binance piloted an AI-powered NFT generator project called ""Bicasso"" last week. The system was able to generate 10,000 NFTs in just 2.5 hours.

2/3/23,Debunking the ridiculous 'J-curve' theory.,"I keep seeing this stupid 'J curve' theory that crypto shitcoin maxi's perpetrate. The idea is that you have initial excitement in a coin tapering off, and then consolidation as it builds momentum and then bursts into mainstream. 

I wanna show why that's not always right.  

###[The J-curve](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FqP9hBsWcAADfmv?format=jpg&name=large)

This idea in Crypto originates from a bunch of new coins popping in at the end of the 2017-2018 bull run. This was the first sensational bull run where Crypto was everywhere in the news. Everyone wanted the new Ethereum, so people went hunting for low-cap altcoins and found 'em.  

These then shot up in price, and as the 2018 bear market took over (worst yet in Crypto history), they slowly died off. Strong coins like BTC, ETH, ADA & BNB had their run in 2017, then simmered off until running again in 2021. These are the exception, not the rule.  

###[The oft-pointed to ADA J-curve](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FqQBw0YXoAApFDU?format=png&name=900x900)  

On Coinmarketcap, we can use a [history function](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/) to view the charts of any given date. Lets take the end of the bullrun, which is the first week of January 2018.

[These are the top coins.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FqQB5-xXwAAs6V3?format=jpg&name=large) To veterans, these names will be very familiar. To newbies from 2021, they won't mean anything to you, because you've never heard of them, because they fucking died.

So let's go and look at where they are in the J-curve...

You'd struggle to find even 8 coins that existed in '18 with a pump, that had a bigger pump in '21. Everything else died or languished in obscurity.

Have you actually done a survey of early BTC adopters to know what they did? I haven't and you haven't. Going by anecdotal evidence some did sell early and most didn't. I know very few that sold and I have been around since the early days. It doesn't meant those holders are all very rich because some gambled on trashy alts or margin traded. 

Early BTCers were holders in their ideology. In the early days people would get reprimanded on forums for wanting to sell into fiat. These were either BTC and crypto maxis.

Now it is possible the new folks would not have had the same mindset as the early adopters. Maybe they would have sold but don't you see how many people on here regret not cashing out their gains in the last 2 bull runs? For many of us the problem is not selling at high prices instead of selling.

I got into BTC a lot earlier than most and instead of making myself feel good by pretending I would have sold early, I say I was stupid for not getting in even earlier. It was my ignorance which made me ignore BTC in the first 2 years. It is not harmful to have regrets because it motivates you to become smarter. ETH came along and I bought it within weeks of the exchange listing. Opportunities in the market come along every few months. We just need to learn."

3/3/23,"Modular blockchains: the ""Y""","Blockchains are the backbone of the cryptocurrency industry, providing an immutable and transparent ledger for transactions. As the adoption of cryptocurrencies has increased, the need for scalability and security has become even more paramount. To address these concerns, modular blockchains have emerged as a solution. This aims to compare modular blockchains and examine their different particularities.

Modular blockchains are composed of independent modules that interact with each other. Each module performs a specific function, such as transaction processing, consensus, and governance. These modules can be updated or replaced without affecting the rest of the blockchain network. This modularity allows developers to build custom blockchains that meet specific requirements, such as scalability, security,  privacy and in some cases, all of them at once.

One of the main advantages of modular blockchains is their scalability. Traditional blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, have faced scalability issues due to their monolithic design (BTC - by design, Ethereum is currently addressing this issue through their latest updates). 

Another advantage of modular blockchains is their security. In traditional blockchains, a security breach in one module can compromise the entire network. Modular blockchains, on the other hand, isolate modules from each other, so a security breach in one module does not affect the rest of the network. This modularity also allows for easier auditing and testing of individual modules, ensuring that the network is secure and free from vulnerabilities.

Privacy is another concern that modular blockchains can address. By using modular design, developers can create custom blockchains that prioritize privacy. For example, a healthcare blockchain could have a module that encrypts patient data, making it accessible only to authorized parties.

In conclusion, modular blockchains provide a flexible and scalable solution to the challenges facing traditional blockchains. By using independent modules, developers can create custom blockchains that meet specific requirements, such as scalability, security, and privacy. 

There are several modular blockchains available in the market, each with its unique features and capabilities. Some of the most popular modular blockchains are:

1. Syscoin - Syscoin is a modular PoW backed blockchain platform that provides security, flexibility, scalability, and interoperability for businesses and developers. The team behind it has announced the launch of their L2 rollups by end of Q1/beginning of Q2 2023, which combined with the already existing Proof of Data Availability would be a world first blockchain scalability solution.
2. Polkadot - Polkadot is a multi-chain platform that allows developers to create custom blockchains that can communicate and exchange data with each other. It uses a modular design to achieve scalability, interoperability, and security.
3. Cosmos - Cosmos is another multi-chain platform that enables interoperability between different blockchains. It uses a modular architecture called the Tendermint Core that provides fast and secure consensus.
4. Dragonchain - Dragonchain is a hybrid blockchain platform that uses a modular architecture to provide flexibility and scalability. It supports public, private, and hybrid blockchains and allows businesses to customize their blockchain solutions.
5. Hyperledger Fabric - Hyperledger Fabric is a modular blockchain platform developed by the Linux Foundation. It is designed for enterprise use cases and provides privacy, scalability, and security through its modular architecture.

These are just a few examples of the many modular blockchains available in the market today. As the demand for blockchain technology continues to grow, we can expect to see more modular blockchains emerge, each with its unique features and capabilities."

* **Listening to colleagues‚Äô beliefs and not being able to counter-argue in fear of complains.** You cannot even counter-argue a flat-earther at work, they ‚Äòll go to HR and complain.

3/3/23,"CLEVELAND, Ohio ‚Äî A leading cryptocurrency kiosk company conspired to profit from financial scams that preyed on the vulnerable, contributing to more than $3.5 million in illicit funds taken from the pockets of Northeast Ohioans in 2021, authorities announced Thursday.","Sonny Meraban, the owner of Illinois-based SandP Solutions, was indicted Wednesday by a Cuyahoga County grand jury on a host of financial crimes following a two-year federal investigation. Also indicted were Meraban‚Äôs father, Reza; an associate, William Suriano, and the company itself, which does business as Bitcoin of America. 

The probe, led by the U.S. Secret Service, resulted in the seizure Wednesday of 52 kiosks across Cuyahoga and Lorain counties, mostly from gas stations, Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Michael O‚ÄôMalley told reporters. A search warrant was also executed on Bitcoin of America‚Äôs office in Lisle, Illinois.

Sonny Meraban, 45, was arrested Wednesday at his Miami Beach, Florida, residence, while Reza Mehraban, 75, and Suriano, 69, were arrested in Chicago.

The arrests, searches and kiosk seizures required more than 100 law enforcement officers, authorities said, noting that the investigation involved more than two dozen federal and local law enforcement agencies across several states.

‚ÄúObviously, this was a very complex operation,‚Äù O‚ÄôMalley said.

Bitcoin of America is one of the largest cryptocurrency kiosk companies in the country, operating more than 2,100 kiosks in 31 states and transmitting a quarter billion dollars across the world last year, according to the Secret Service.

Officials began looking into the company in 2021, soon after the Secret Service‚Äôs Cleveland office started getting complaints of scams involving their kiosks, Blaine Forschen, special agent in charge of the office, said during Thursday‚Äôs press conference. The Secret Service has long investigated counterfeiting and other financial crimes.

The investigation soon became national in scope. Through robocalls and emails, scammers were persuading vulnerable Americans ‚Äî including several elderly Ohioans ‚Äî to deposit thousands of dollars into Bitcoin of America kiosks, to be converted into cryptocurrency and deposited into third-party accounts, Forschen said. The scammers would pretend to be government officials or soldiers stationed overseas seeking romance, for example."

3/3/23,Test to see if Coin is a Shitcoin or not -> Check the Price when UTC clock hits 0.,"Now, one can make an argument that besides BTC, ETH, and maybe a couple of others, pretty much all cryptocurrency is a pile of dump.  I sympathesize with this view.  But let's be generous and say that there are roughly 100 or so coins that are somewhat ok and the rest are SHIT squared.  How can you differentiate?

One way to differentiate between decent and shit is to monitor the price movement of these coins when UTC clock hits new day.  For some reason, the bots loving pumping/dumping shitcoins just when UTC clock hits 00:00:00 every day.  So often in whatever app that you use, you will see that certain coins pump and dump right when the clock hits 0:00.  This doesn't mean that they will always pump/dump during this time but more than often, you will see that this is the case.  On the other hand, for legit coins like BTC and ETH, the UTC clokcing hitting 0:00 barely has any effect on it as it is just like any other time.

EDIT1:  some examples of these are (and you can find plenty)

AQT, ARK, ELF, POWR, MTL, GLM, REP, KNC, TON, etc.

So if you are noticing that the coin that you hold tend to go up and down significantly at the same time of the day, chances are that you are holding a shitcoin that only exists to be manipulated by its whales.

EDIT2:  I would like to add that just because it isn't pumped/dumped at UTC = 0, that doesn't mean that it isn't a shitcoin.  Some shitcoins don't operate like this.  My point is that IF it does pump/dump at UTC = 0, this guarantees that it is a shitcoin.

EDIT3:  I would like to also state that this is where people play the crypto lottery.  That is, just before UTC = 0, they put a lot of their money into these shitcoins wanting to see it moon.  This is like the shitcoin roulette at UTC = 0 that most people do not know about. "

I really see no one talking about merged-mining in this space, most probably because 99% of people doesn't know it exist, and the other part just doesn't really understand it.

I'm also not truly super technical about it, but looking at it and the future of BTC and others, it really resonates with it.

**What is Merged Mining then?**

""Merged mining or AUXPoW (Auxiliar Proof of Work) is a sustainable security solution, much like entering multiple lotteries with a single ticket, merged mining allows users to take the BTC hash for a current block and apply it to different blockchains. With these additional rewards, there is more incentive for miners to participate and cause the hashrate and overall network security to increase proportionately, with benefits to all participants."" Quote from GMMA

So we can say that merged mining is a form of green PoW, because you're not using more resources to mine, you're using the same hashrate and applying it to other Blockchains.
Not only that, but if you're merged mined with BTC, you will also inherit its security.

With this in mind, and knowing that BTC will keep halving ""forever"", how can the future be sustainable for miners to keep mining? I know a lot of people say that BTC will increase in price accordingly and transactions fees will be sufficient, but we are not really sure of that, and I really think merged-mining will be the solution.

There aren't many projects that use BTC Merged-Mining, right now, the only ones I know about are Syscoin and Jax Network. This is because Syscoin and Jax started something called ""GMMA"" (Global Merged Mining Aliance), the main goal being to bring merged mining education to everyone.

‚ÄúThe beauty of merged mining is that we can re-apply all of our hashing power to support multiple networks and build a thriving software ecosystem at the same time,‚Äù said Jag Sidhu, Syscoin Lead Developer and Foundation President. ‚ÄúHowever, merged mining is currently relatively unknown, under developed, and under-utilised. The GMMA is here to change this.‚Äù.

Fun fact is that Dogecoin is merged-mined with Litecoin, so most of the hashrate that Litecoin has is because people want to mine Dogecoin.

TLDR: Merged mining allows you to mine multiple currencies at the same time with the same hashrate/resources. If you're mining BTC right now, you can opt in to mine Syscoin or other BTC merged mined coin and get double rewarded for the same work.

Let me know your thoughts on this and if you ever heard of merged-mining."

3/3/23,Are you aware of all the risks using a crypto company? Some may surprise you.,"As CeFi crypto companies are clearly failing to disclose proper risks I wanted to list out all the known risks (that I'm aware of) so that you have a proper understanding on what you‚Äôre getting into when you do business with a crypto company.

&#x200B;

1. **Hacks:** The obvious one: your crypto held with these companies can be vulnerable to hacks, despite every security measure you take vulnerabilities can still be found. Exchanges are particularly attractive to hackers as they are effectively honey pots.
2. **Clowns in operation:** It‚Äôs quite possible you may have a lot of confidence in the executives running your favourite exchange etc but recent events have shown that this can all appear to be an elaborate mirage. Ask yourself: ‚ÄúHow can I be sure this company isn‚Äôt abusing custody of my funds?‚Äù The reality is that you really can‚Äôt.
3. **Regulatory risk**: This can lead to heavy fines and a clampdown on company operations increasing the overall risk of insolvency.
4. **Lack of customer protection in terms & conditions**: If the terms literally say you don‚Äôt own squat then understand that will make your life harder in the event of a bankruptcy. Check the terms! It will be used against you in a bankrupcy.
5. **Volatility:** Somewhat related to 2 (clowns in operation) but it is quite apparent that some crypto company executives are surprised to find out that a crypto bear market comes along practically every 4 years often meaning that companies find themselves overextended from all the bull market expansions they‚Äôve been making. Overall this increases the risk of company bankruptcy and the result is: a loss of your coins.
6. **Lack of regulatory protection:** Crypto companies are not required to segregate client funds, the insurance they claim to have often is not fit for purpose and they also aren‚Äôt recognised as securities and therefore don‚Äôt abide by the same protections. Recognise that this puts you at a significant disadvantage in the event of a bankruptcy.
7. **Clawbacks:** As currently seen in Celsius and Voyager bankruptcy clawbacks are being pursued on everyday people not just insiders. Essentially if you withdrew your crypto prior to 90 days of a companies bankruptcy filing date then you could be exposing yourself to a risk that you may be legally required to send it back as it is seen a ‚Äòpreferential payment‚Äô.You may be thinking: ‚ÄúAre the coins still mine but just on the platform?‚Äù No, they will be distributed to other creditors.Imagine you had funds on Celsius but withdrew say 1 BTC to a competitor when they started lowering interest rates. Maybe that competitor was Voyager. You're now on the hook for paying back 2 BTC that you don't even have.Just one of many reasons why it‚Äôs important to withdraw now rather than later.
8. **Company issues its own token**: Sounds good in a bull market until reality shows that all it does is fuel greed and encourages executives to pump the price and borrow against it increasing the overall risk of insolvency when a bear market comes around. In the event of a bankruptcy it also means YOU get less of a payout because the tokens are not actually marked down to 0 despite effectively being a company stock derivative. See Celsius bankruptcy on this one.
9. **Personal hacks + clawback**: Imagine you got hacked in your personal account. Now imagine the company which held your funds went bankrupt within that 90 day period. Have fun explaining to a litigation trust that the withdrawal wasn‚Äôt you and that you were hacked and don‚Äôt have the crypto to return when clawbacks are pursued.
10. **Time**: Perhaps the biggest cost when it comes to bankruptcies is just how freaking long and stressful it can be. Why put yourself through all of the above when you can just self custody?

**Conclusion:**

Use a P2P exchange so you don‚Äôt expose yourself to any kind of clawback AND use a hardware wallet. Self-custody is the way. That is all."

They changed the smart contract midway to gain control again over the lost assets. 

>To quickly summarize this transaction, the Sender upgraded the automation contract to a new proxy that allowed the Sender to move the collateral and debt from vault 30100 out of the Exploiter‚Äôs control.

Reading the various ways an Ethereum smart contract can be changed afterwards it points to #3 **proxy pattern**, if I understand correctly. [Upgrading smart contracts | ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/upgrading/#proxy-patterns)

>The proxy pattern also uses data separation to keep business logic and data in separate contracts. However, in a proxy pattern, the storage contract (called a proxy) calls the logic contract during code execution. This is a reverse of the data separation method, where the logic contract calls the storage contract.

How do **other chains** handle these cases? Do they also offer smart contract upgrades? 

Is this something we **should be worried about?** I know that I should sign only the contracts that I can trust, but if they can change, who can I still trust?"

Someone or some bot randomly messaged me, and told me I was referred (LOL right there I should have blocked them) for a claim bonus.

All I had to do was open an account with them, link my TrustWallet, deposit $1,000 or more and my bonus would be deposited when they went live. I started asking about the whitepaper and their ecosystem, but was only sent a link (which I didn't click). They said the $1,000 claim bonus was good for 3 days, and today was the last day. 

A free $1,000 sounds too good to be true, but just wanted to check if anyone else came across this?

3/3/23,Esperanto and Crypto,"Esperanto is a spoken/written human language designed to solve all of the problems with the languages which evolved naturally in all of our cultures. Esperanto reduces ambiguity, removes uncertainty, dramatically reduces miscommunication. And since these are the things that often lead to war and conflict, its widespread use should reduce the occurrence of those things too.  That is what its inventor and early adherents hoped for:  world peace!  Yet, a hundred and thirty years after its invention, many people in the world are not even aware of its existence, let alone fluent in it.

Compare and contrast the aspirations of Esperanto with the aspirations of crypto. Crypto is, in many aspects, better than fiat.  It can be decentralizable and trustless and anonymous and fast (though of course various implementations emphasize or deemphasize various of these).  Since those issues, especially the centralization issue, at the root of major social issues, our adherents hope that widespread crypto adoption will bring major positive social change.  And yet, Esperanto shows us that ""better"" doesn't always cut it. The world has to notice, and care, beyond some balance threshold, for there to be widespread adoption. What lessons do you take from the story of Esperanto for crypto?"

I heard that you can pay off your house mortgage with moons, but I'm not sure how to do this. 

As you would expect of a millennial teacher in the US with a Master of Education degree, I am currently struggling to make ends meet and have nearly run through my savings just paying bills. I do make my own coffee and stopped eating avocado toast. I also have considered picking up a second or even third job. Teaching does give me some free time that I spend at home with my family, but I've considered sacrificing that to try to keep up with inflation and the impending financial collapse. 

I know I'm pretty fortunate among my peers because I'm not also being financially rear ended by a parasitic landlord.

Still, when I heard that a person could pay off their mortgage with moons, I got pretty excited! I think I have about 19 of them in my vault. How can I sell these bad boys?

After I read it I let my wife know the mortgage was going to be taken care of and that we'd have an extra 700 a month in disposable income soon! She told me I had to respect the restraining order she put in place because I wouldn't stop talking about how Luna Classic was going to the moon.

3/3/23,Why Cryptocurrency is Important,"There's been a surprising amount of people in this sub claiming no cryptocurrency has any use case, and that the entire thing is a scam and they are here just for gains. So I decided to write out why cryptocurrency is actually important and/or useful.

Cryptocurrency has a number of potential benefits, including:

Decentralization: Cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks, which means they are not controlled by any government or financial institution. This can provide users with greater privacy, security, and independence.

Security: Cryptocurrencies use advanced cryptographic techniques to secure transactions, making them highly resistant to hacking and fraud.

Accessibility: Cryptocurrencies can be used by anyone with an internet connection, regardless of their location or financial status. This can be particularly beneficial for people who do not have access to traditional banking services.

Transparency: Cryptocurrency transactions are recorded on a public ledger, which makes them transparent and difficult to manipulate. This can help to reduce corruption and improve accountability.

Innovation: Cryptocurrencies are still a relatively new technology, and they are constantly evolving. This creates opportunities for innovation and new applications that could have a positive impact on the economy and society as a whole.

Potential for investment: Some people see cryptocurrencies as a promising investment opportunity, with the potential for high returns. However, it is important to note that investing in cryptocurrencies also carries significant risks, and should be approached with caution"

3/3/23,21 Million Bitcoin Isn't Enough. This Visualization Proves It. Appreciate Your Insights: What Am I Missing?,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vxuazggnnila1.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3b24dedd3f689a7d13d93c1d7bc857a95fd162c8

This isn't Bitcoin fud. I'm soliciting opinions. Bitcoin's 21 Million cap has always been something I've considered.

This visualization paints a picture more or less of the world's currency, debt, and instruments of value. In a Bitcoin world, how does it work?

I see Bitcoin as a store of value play, but not as currency. There simply isn't enough. Up until the late Middle Ages, the world's major economies operated on bimetallism systems because there wasn't enough gold. You needed silver for everyday transactions.

And its divisibility is irrelevant. Division is not addition.

So how does Bitcoin work in this context?

I don't think it does.

EDIT: Your small pizza is sliced 6 ways. If you run the cutter across it and now have 8 slices, it's still a small pizza. Bitcoin divisibility works the same way. Slice it into nothing but Sats, and it doesn't increase Bitcoin's cap value. "

2/3/23,Rules of Etiquette for Bitcoiners.,"As the late great Biggie Smalls would say:  ""It's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual.""  Guys, when this next halving arrives in a little over a year, we're going to start to become quite wealthy.  Those miners won't be able to dump anywhere near as much BTC on the market, and the upward pressure on the price will be palpable.  We all know this.  Hell, I saw an article that says over 70% of all BTC has been hodled for over a year now.  

But with that wealth comes responsibility.  We should be gracious winners, and care about others who are less fortunate.  I propose the following:

\- Only try the orange pill on someone one time.  After that, leave it.  Talk about the basketball game instead.  More than once, you're bugging them.  They'll figure it out on their own time. 

\- Let's get rid of ""Have fun staying poor.""  It's just, not a nice thing to say.  We don't need to spike the football.  Better would be ""good luck with your alt-coin"", or whatever.  

\- Let's also get rid of ""I lost it in a boating accident"".  That's a precious metals kind of saying, and they can have it.  How would you lose BTC in a boating accident anyhow?  If you know your seed words, you'd just go and recover it.  We've already taken the air out of gold and silver with a far better and more scarce asset, and BTC lives in their heads rent-free.  Do we need to steal their saying also?  

\- Never tell anyone how much BTC you own.  You can tell them in a roundabout way that requires them to do some math and know about BTC, such as ""I have enough BTC that if everyone in New York has as much as I do, there'd be no BTC left.""  But never give the actual amount.  

\- Always have a backup wallet, in addition to your daily-use wallet.  And keep the vast majority of your BTC in the backup.  That way if you get robbed, you only lose the daily-use balance.  

\- Never get frustrated with people who don't come around to thinking BTC is great and who aren't interested in it.  They'll come around on their own in time.  The legacy banking system still works pretty well for most people in the western world, and people are slow to change something that seems to be working.  We have to exercise extreme patience and understanding.  

That's pretty much it.  Stack on and hodl!!!  : - )"

My question is, how can a Bitcoin ATM let someone buy without specifying a receiving address, or allow buying into an address that someone already controls. I assume it must be an inside job, and the owner of the machine has access to the temporary wallets it must create upon purchase. Could someone set up the machine to receive, then walk away as your victim is on the phone coming around the corner and then finish the session with my FIL inserting all that cash and getting a useless receipt.

Long story short, that card was compromised at some point and blocked by the bank. Her money was issued to a virtual debit card which cannot be used at a contactless ATM here in US because if you're using ATM's NFC here in US, they want you to use their bank's issued cards.  It also can't be transferred via MoneyGram/WU because of the war. 

We've tried to buy BTC recently and it seems places like Coinbase wants me to use a US issued card ( they keep requiring zipcode.)

As I see it, I have 2 options in front of me.

1. I tell her about the gains, and attempt to persuade her to pay the taxes out of our savings so as not to sell BTC to pay the taxes, incurring further taxes next year. But I fear she will want to use some of it to pay down our mortgage or equity loan, or use it for other material purposes. My intention is to keep working on it to give our kids a full ride through college.

2. I sell BTC, incur taxes next year, and keep the investments in the dark from her so it doesn't cause some B.S. argument or otherwise to unfold. I don't necessarily want to sell BTC to settle it knowing that we're nearing a halving...

Investors put something together against these crypto scams such as getting locked.
Liquidity.

And then any funds that are sent to any of these Addresses to any of these wallets that they have to return the funds.
If that token or coin is just sitting there. And the same with.
If they change to a different version that that doesn't matter if they give some kind of fake notice only on their website but they don't give any of their investors actual notices.
To each of their emails or their accounts.
That they. Have to return those funds.
Or upgrade them and migrate them.
Regardless of the age as long as they still have the tokens and funds.
They should be automatically migrated.
And not? The. Responsibility of the investor since the investor is not the one who is Upgrading the version of the coin and has invested in that company.
Period it's only fair we need to get these.

üéóDear friends, after a long run, we decide to open the test environment in late tomorrow, 26th Feb. It would be a test version serving test coins. The testing would be in around 2 weeks for ramping up and issue fixing.

After that, we would open the production environment.

Thanks for your support!

APK: [https://github.com/mobazha/mobazha/releases/download/v0.8.1-test/mobazhaTest.apk](https://github.com/mobazha/mobazha/releases/download/v0.8.1-test/mobazhaTest.apk)

Search Site: [https://console.mobazha.info](https://console.mobazha.info/)

We support BCH and LTC in this test version. You could get test coins from faucets.

BCH: [https://tbch.googol.cash/](https://tbch.googol.cash/)

LTC: [https://testnet-faucet.com/ltc-testnet/](https://testnet-faucet.com/ltc-testnet/)

Any issue or question, welcome to contact in the space, or file an issue in [https://github.com/mobazha/mobazha/issues](https://github.com/mobazha/mobazha/issues).

As it is a test version, we still have work to do:

1. Refresh the first page to apply the right search result for stores and goods
2. Notification system is still being worked on. It doesn't work yet in the test version.

Any other issue, please let us know.

For desktop and iOS version, due to work load, we would not release at this moment. We might try to relase iOS version in this first half year, due to Apple store review.

If you don't know how to get testcoins, you could share your BCH/LTC testnet app address. We could do help."

This was the first time when FTX publicly acknowledged the missing funds. According to the report, the exchange could only find $2.7 billion, with an account balance of $11.6 billion. These estimates are based on cryptocurrency prices from when the company filed for bankruptcy last November.

Under new CEO John Ray, FTX has been hard at work finding and protecting the billions of client dollars that have gone missing since filing for bankruptcy. Despite his best efforts, Ray warned that it is currently impossible to determine how much money customers will ultimately be able to return.

Does anyone know why there was no transaction fee for the USDC transfer?

3/3/23,Case #14755834,"Support,

All I want to do is move Ethereum from my web3 wallet to my main balance on ""Coinbase"" itself.¬†

I try to move Ethereum from the web3 wallet to the main balance using the Coinbase¬†smartphone application.¬†

The transaction fails and I cannot attempt it again because the Coinbase smartphone application immediately asks me to send pictures of my ID to restore the web3 wallet.

So, I cannot attempt the transaction again, as you suggest, because I am immediately prevented from attempting any more transactions.¬†

Even after my web3 wallet is recovered¬†to the phone, the same error repeats itself when I try to move my Ethereum.

The Coinbase smartphone application demands that I recover the web3 wallet and I have no other option.

The issue remains unresolved.¬†

I am using Coinbase on an Android smartphone, a Samsung Galaxy s21 FE running Android 13.

I have sent numerous screenshots already as attachments. The error is the same.

I cannot replicate¬†the problem because all I can do is try to recover my web3 wallet, which takes two days, and then try and fail again.

Please, please, please give me different advice next time.

Regards,

Case #14755834"
3/3/23,Something very Strange is happening at Coinbase,"I have been a long time Coinbase user and rarely run into problems.  However, something is changing.

I have always had a standard level of limits set-up on my account with full account validation confirmed.  However, the limits this week are changing wildly and without user activity.  For instance, Apple Pay purchasing has moved from $5,000 to $3,000 to $400.  

When contacted, Coinbase will say it is the bank.  However, this is where it gets interesting.  The bank I spoke to said they've received countless calls this week about this from Coinbase customers.  They are approving purchases--coinbase has some sort of bug or something.

Coinbase support won't actually address the problem--it is all very interesting and scary I suppose if you use Coinbase heavily.  Just wanted to share because something is going on and it is very odd within Coinbase itself."
3/3/23,Plaid not connecting accounts,"For the past few months I haven't been able to connect my bank. The bank will send me an email telling me it worked and then I get back to coinbase and get ""something went wrong"" can't add money to my coinbase card. Paying the money to add to that defeats the point of having it. 
 
Has anyone else had this problem? Every time I see an update to coinbase I hope it will fix the problem, hasn't."

I'm wondering if anyone knows if these exchanges offer any alternatives to Plaid/Trustly for bank deposits?

Additionally, I'm curious if there are any other cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the United States that offer alternative methods for bank deposits? I'm open to exploring other options if they exist.

Lastly, I'm wondering if there's a way to manually link your bank account with Coinbase without having to go through the Plaid requirement? I'm not comfortable with sharing my bank login credentials, but I still want to be able to make bank deposits.

If anyone has any insight or experience with these questions, I'd really appreciate any help or advice you can offer. Thanks in advance!"

3/3/23,Transaction,"
Guys,

I have been trying to receive BTC by sending my BTC adress (3MsRD6Feu57QEJsSDLahYDV3JnJTXP41A9) to my irl friend; he sent it 2 hours by also using Coinbase but I have not received it yet.

The customer service is super bad and the chat does not redirect me to a live agent; it keeps closing on me or telling me to go to the contact form and then the page stops working. Since I am from the Netherlands, I am not able to reach out to their customer service by phone now.

What is going on? 2 hours is way to long right? In order to receive BTC?

He had an e-mail from coinbase wich stated that he had to verify the transaction, he did so. After that it still shows the amount on his balance but when he tries to cash out or transfer again the balance is being adjusted by deducting the amount that he tried to send to me.

Could anyone please help us out here and tell me what is going on?"
