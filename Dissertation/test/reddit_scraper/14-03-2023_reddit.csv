13/3/23,"The US Government is about to gaslight the failure of banks as a failure of crypto. Dont be fooled - the bank failure has nothing to do with crypto, and everything to do with banks buying treasuries/MBS and regulatory failure","The US government is already trying to blame crypto as the cause for the banking failures - 3 banks which failed over the course of a last week. 

These are all the articles that are doing the round since yesterday's bailout: 

[Barney Frank sees crypto as a common element in bank failures](https://preview.redd.it/vz4hr73iphna1.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=aee433f2fd4f4e5410b74a7fa326be2939fdaf7a)

This sinister article above, where Barney Frank (the guy who established Dodd-Frank act) tried to pin all the blame on crypto. In reality, all the failures were due to these banks holding treasuries and not because of crypto. 

Banks are regulated and legally cannot  hold any crypto, nor do they hold any crypto. They have no losses from holding cryptos, nor any bad loans or investments in crypto companies. These banks have been shuttered because they ran up big losses on their treasury portfolios.

In reality, crypto has nothing to even do with these bank failures. None of the banks held cryptos in their balance sheet, they all held treasuries, and they mismanaged their risk and poor regulation allowed a run on these banks. They posted huge losses on their treasuries portfolios, owing to which these banks werent able to honor redemptions. 

Yet all the articles speak about crypto! Crypto is the biggest scapegoat right now, and the administration is trying its best to pin all the bank failures on crypto. 

Coming to these banks, SVB - silicon valley bank had major exposure to VC backed companies. They had little to do with crypto at all.

Silvergate and Signature bank were crypto friendly banks, but their asset liability mismatch has nothing to do with crypto. Infact many believe that Signature bank was on track to honor its redemptions but was force closed by the government, just so that they can pin all of it on crypto while at the same time off ramping one of the crypto-friendly banks.

# Yellen Admits Bank Failures Are Due To Loss In Value of Treasuries:

[In an interview yesterday. Secretary of Treasury admitted that the bank's problems were due to loss in market value of treasuries and MBS](https://preview.redd.it/4vunshvirhna1.png?width=464&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=231eaa09db91a3d9ed10fa2e0cfe446d3d36b425)

Yet the articles are just coming out where the headlines make it sound as if its all to do with crypto. 

The Fed almost never takes any responsibility for the failures they cause.  From their relentless QE/buying junk assets for a whole decade, to claiming inflation was transitory and allowing inflation to peak at 7%, to now unprecedented rate hikes causing damage to the economy, they have never taken responsibility for any of the major mistakes that have snowballed into economic crisis. 

And now they have a ready made scapegoat who they can pin all the blame on - crypto!"

One of the oldest and best pieces of advice this sub gives is to not share your seed.

Well, I was a stubborn person and went against this critical advice by sharing my fucking seed with my wife.

She didnt steal my crypto, if that is what you are thinking. She's actually a very sweet and kind and supportive wife who lets me spend many hours on crypto every day. 

The problem is that 9 months after sharing my seed, I became a father. My daughter just turned four yet already cost me more than $80,000. Diapers and daycare were insanely expensive! Daycare cost me over $2K per month.

I did some research and it is estimated that from the day a baby is born until the day they turn 18, a family will spend about $310,605 — or about $17,000 a year. And this estimation was made before inflation. It is much worse now.

* EOS - Once a top 9 at market cap of $8.3B in Jan 2018. Once said ""enormous upside *potential* in the future and has a place in every investor's portfolio"",  ""conduct millions of transactions per second"". Turn out to be a complete flop.
* ICON - The ""Korean Ethereum"".  Aimed to ""hyperconnect the world"", ""powered by Loopchain, which is a high-performance enterprise blockchain with smart contract features"". Once top 15, now well forgotten.
* BCH - Bitcoin Cash promoted by Bitcoin Jesus Roger Vers. Once a top 4! Not much thoughts these days.
* BTG - Bitcoin Gold, similar fate and even worse than BCH
* IOTA - Once a top 10, designed for ""Internet of Things"", ""potentially higher scalability over blockchain based distributed ledgers"".  IOTA has been the target of phishing, scamming, and hacking attempts with ton of down time. Now not much talks.
* NEM - Used to be a top 7. Can't even recall the last time I read something about this.
* QTUM - ditto
* LISK - ditto
* DASH - once said to be a rival of Monero. Pretty forgotten now.
* BitConnect - no further explation needed.
* NANO - once heavily shilled by this sub, ""fast, feeless and environment friendly"".

some users have not been able to get the conversion to work on the coinbase app but it seems to be working on the website.

13/3/23,Would you be trusting USDC more than USDT if it repegs today?,"USDC is currently trading at 0.99$ and is nearing a repeg if the SVB situation is handled soon enough. 

However, it still amazes me how weak the response to the depeg was overall, from the media and regulators who would usually seize the chance and start discussing how the stablecoin issuer (Circle) will be taken to court, from the market ( honestly I have expected a much bigger sellout due to this de-peg, but the markets didn't move much), and finally from social media, where people soon divided on whether or not to swap their USDC and started joking about how they expected this happening to USDT instead of USDC.

Basically everyone seems to not trust USDT (or at least that's what it looks like it on this sub), but still, this stable has ~73B$ MarketCap compared to USDC's ~40B$. While most people seems to trust it with their funds, most people seem to have a sum of their portfolio ready to short it at the least possible depeg. 

I know crypto doesn't usually make sense anyway, but what do you think about the stablecoin landscape in the near future? Do you think USDT will be the crowned king after it survived the SBV crash? Or is it doomed to be an ""IoU"" that might expire at any moment? And will you still trust your funds with USDC?"

The COVID situation was really bad here in the country and doctors and nurses were (and still are) having a bad time with monthly wages under 100 USD. Yes, under 100 USD.

To support Guaido, US Government with the support of AirTM (Which some of the creators are users here, I have chatted with one of them) approved the exchanged from USD propriety of the Venezuelan Government (frozen funds to Maduro) to USDC to send them to Venezuela using AirTM.

Guaido sent the list of the health workers to AirTM and they pre-opened an account for them.

Each doctor and nurse, got 300 USDC (100 USD per three months).

It worked fine and I personally know people that received the money (Remember I live here), it probably saved lives (I'm not exaggerating, 300 USDC is good money considering monthly minimum wage is 5 USD).

The crypto rollercoaster continues and we saw a lot of movement in prices today. Crypto started to pump after the speech from Biden and a lot of assets were liquidated (mostly shorts). In this post I'll give the most important liquidation statistics from the last 24h.

The stats in the past 24h **at the time of writing**:

\- In the past 24 hours, **$310.85M** of assets were liquidated.  
\- Liquidated longs and shorts: **$59.95M** were **longs (19.29%)** and **$250.90M** were **shorts (80.71%)**.  
\- **78.914**  traders were liquidated.  
\- Top 3 Liquidations: **$125.28M** of BTC, **$88.39M** of ETH and **$6.62M** of CFX.  
\- The largest single liquidation order happened on **Binance - ETHUSDT value $7.42M.**

13/3/23,"Barney Frank, Director of Signature Bank and former US House Rep claims that the bank was shut down by the US government just to send a message to crypto, despite being solvent.","Barney Frank, a director at Signature Bank which was shut down by the government over the weekend has just said that the bank was shut down to send a message to crypto, and not because they were facing any kind of insolvency. These are shocking revelations as it appears that the US government just killed a legal and solvent bank just because they can, just because didn't approve of pro-crypto stance of the bank. In the process, wiping out shareholders to zero. 

These are quotes from Frank, who also drafted the Dodd-Frank Act:

>**“I think part of what happened was that regulators wanted to send a very strong anti-crypto message,” said board member and former congressman Barney Frank.**  
>  
>For his part, Frank, who helped draft the landmark Dodd-Frank Act after the 2008 financial crisis, said there was “no real objective reason” that Signature had to be seized.  
>  
>“I think part of what happened was that regulators wanted to send a very strong anti-crypto message,” Frank said. “We became the poster boy because there was no insolvency based on the fundamentals.”  
>  
>[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/13/signature-bank-third-biggest-bank-failure-in-us-history.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/13/signature-bank-third-biggest-bank-failure-in-us-history.html)

This confirms many people's beliefs that the bank was shut down just because they had a pro-crypto stance, and were facilitating crypto exchanges and stablecoin liquidity using their Signet network, which allowed stablecoins like USDC to obtain banking system liquidity throughout the weekend when other banks were closed. The government's statement said there were ""systemic issues"" at Signature Bank, and was entirely vague. 

Compare the vague statement issued by NYDFS on closure of Signature Bank ([found here](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/reports_and_publications/press_releases/pr20230312)) versus the detailed order passed by California DFPI taking over Silicon Valley Bank ([found here](https://dfpi.ca.gov/2023/03/10/california-financial-regulator-takes-possession-of-silicon-valley-bank/)). In Silicon Valley Bank's case, California DFPI have specifically found that the bank is insolvent and passed a fact finding order, whereas in Signature bank, the NYDFS statement is totally value with no fact finding order. 

There was no liquidity issue at Signature bank, but the government used the window of opportunity that arose over the weekend from Silicon Valley Bank's failure, to kill off another bank SBNY which was pro-crypto. 

As the saying goes, ""Never let any crisis go to waste"" 

It now appears that the bank was killed just to shut down crypto access to banking. Shareholders in SBNY have been wiped out to zero as the FDIC took over the bank. The shares were trading at $70 per share at close of trading on friday. Not only the shareholders, even unsecured bond holders of the bank have been wiped out."

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the 2nd monthly report for the 2023 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, BUSD, DOGE, ADA, MATIC, DOT,** and **LTC.**

**SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 March Snapshot).**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for over 5 years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** ***(including why in the world I would include stablecoins)*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.*** ***Learn more about the new features in the 2023 Top Ten Experiment*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2023/)***.***
* **FEB Highlights:** \- **MATIC** wins February and takes the overall lead from **ADA.**  The 2023 portfolio is +34% so far this year.  DCA'ing once a year into Top Ten Cryptos for the last 6 years has produced much better returns than S&P 500.
* **New feature:** **AMKT** outperforms my Top Ten in Feb and is +43% vs. the Top Ten's +34% in this year’s friendly competition between The Top Ten Portfolio and [The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token](https://alongside.xyz/) (**AMKT**).  

## Month Two – Up +34%

The 2023 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, BUSD, DOGE, ADA, MATIC, DOT, LTC.**

February highlights for the 2023 Top Ten Portfolio:

* After an all-green [January](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1), a mixed month for the 2023 Top Ten
* **MATIC** (+15%) turns in the best performance of February and is in the overall lead
* All cryptos in positive territory for the year

## February Ranking and Dropouts

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks one month into the 2023 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/x8uugb7hfina1.png?width=328&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f2931b4ca2f37952725b8f58d8fa32629046c523

Not much movement so far during the first 60 days of 2023.

## February Winners and Losers

***February Winners*** –  **MATIC** followed up a 44% gain in January with a 15% increase this month.  A distant second place was **DOT**, up 6% in February.

***February Losers*** – **DOGE** lost -10% in this month, much wow. **XRP** and **ADA** both dropped -5% in February as well.

## Overall Update: MATIC overtakes ADA for the lead, all crypto in the green.

Every crypto in this year’s Experiment is in positive territory.

**MATIC** overtook **ADA** this month to take the overall lead, up +65% in two months.  The initial $100 invested in **MATIC** sixty days ago is worth $165 today. 

**DOT** is next, +51% since New Year’s Day.  

**DOGE** is turning in the worst non-stablecoin performance at this stage, but is still well in the green at +16% for the year.

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2023:

The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio gained $13 in February.  The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2023 is now worth **$1,342.** 

Here’s a visual summary of the progress so far:

## 2023 Top Ten Portfolio vs. The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT).

**New feature this year** – The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market***. Much has changed in the last 5 years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market instead of manually buying coins and tokens ([like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2023)).

This year’s friendly competition will be between The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio and [The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token](https://alongside.xyz/) (**AMKT**).  **AMKT** is an ERC-20 token that represents a cap weighted index of the Top 25 Cryptocurrencies (minus stablecoins) backed 1:1 by the underlying assets represented within the index.  Since the Top 25 represent approximately 97% of the value within crypto, **AMKT** should be an excellent proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market – exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start.

Here’s the question I’ll be tracking this year: ***would I have been better off with $1,000 of AMKT instead of going through the effort of creating a homemade $1,000 Top Ten Index Fund?***

On 1 January 2023, $1000 was equal to 17.15 AMKT.  Two months into the Experiment, here’s the **AMKT** snapshot:

**February Performances:**

* **The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio**: +1% 
* **AMKT**: +2%.

The February monthly victory goes to: **The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)**

**Overall since January 1st, 2023:** 

* **The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio:** current value $1,342 (+34%) 
* **AMKT:** current value $1,425 (+43%)

Overall lead: **The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)**

For the more visual, here’s the table I’ll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **AMKT** competition this year:

## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

So, where do we stand if we combine six years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* 2018 Top Ten Experiment: down -42% (total value $578)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-50): up +204% (total value $3,036)
* 2020 Top Ten Experiment: up +358% (total value $4,578) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* 2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +81% (total value $1,811)
* 2022 Top Ten Experiment: down -72% (total value $282) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1): up +34% (total value $1,342)

Taking the six portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $6,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$11,627.** 

**That’s up +94%** on the combined portfolios.  The peak  for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020 for those who do better with visuals:

https://preview.redd.it/v3mu6jqnfina1.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b6e23eff3e2d28bd006abb6544d4ee6cebca7ca4

In summary: ***That’s a +94% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for six straight years***.

## Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets:

https://preview.redd.it/2xwz86rofina1.png?width=538&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f2a091ef3c01a508d872d5735dca1824ebf09011

The S&P 500 is up +3% so far in 2023, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,030 had it been redirected to the S&P.  

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,480 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,580 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,220 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,050 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $830 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,030 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After six $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 my portfolio would be worth $7,190.**

That is up **+20%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+94%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

## Conclusion:

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, try to enjoy the ride. 

A reporting note: I’ll focus on 2023 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports per month.  February’s extended report covers the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio, which you can access [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-50).  You can check out the latest [2018 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-61), [2020 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-35), [2021 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-24), and [2022 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12) reports as well."
13/3/23,"An in-depth look analyzing whether Moons have any properties of a scam coin (as some naysayers have claimed), are too centralized, are at risk of rugpulls, etc... AKA the detailed case as to whether or not Moons are a ""shitcoin"" or too ""scammy"".","# Intro:

Any relatively new coin, introduced to the market, without too much history, with a low market cap, low liquidity, should be met with some scrutiny.

Especially in what they have to offer. Any new coin should be considered a shitcoin until proven otherwise.

Moons are a very different kind of coin. It's a social media token, meant for participation and content reward. It's not primarily meant to buy a cup of coffee, nor have any of the usual DeFi functions.

It's also build exclusively for Reddit, and for this sub.

&#x200B;

# What makes something a scam coin?

Something with the sole purpose of making money for a smaller group of people in a subversive manner, without providing any real solution or services, and at the expense of people investing in that coin, by misleading those investors.

&#x200B;

# What are the typical properties found in scam coins?

These aren't what makes a coin a scam, but usually scams will have several of these symptoms and red flags:

\-Shady team.

\-Aggressive marketing.

\-Marketing focusing on big returns.

\-Complete centralization.

\-Governance too centralized.

\-Focus on returns instead of tech.

\-Doesn't provide a solution, nor not much utility.

\-The proof is in the pudding. The mechanism and tokenomics will reveal if something is a scam.

&#x200B;

# 1- The team.

The team behind Moons have had more than 2 years of work (over 3 years if you count the pre-building). So we are getting a better idea of how they operate now.

The team of developers are the admins from Reddit, not the mods. Some of you may have interacted with them. But the mods here do assist them on the front end and in dealing with the users.

It's really Reddit that's behind Moons. They initiated the project. So Moons come from the very top of Reddit. You have a core developing team, backed by a major social media company, with a front end mod team, and also partnerships outside Reddit.

What have we learned in the last couple years? While initially they didn't communicate as much as we'd have wanted to, that has improved a little. There is still an issue of slow response between the mod team and admin team.

But the admins have shown to provide good development of their token and smart contract, and have been able to find a lot of solutions in scalability and in making Moons work. They've created a secure and functional wallet. The distributions since mainnet have all gone fairly smoothly.

&#x200B;

# 2- The marketing.

If you look at the marketing of Moons, it's very much focused on ""community contribution"" and ""ownership of a piece of a community"". It's very much focus on the social media functions of Moons, and has little to no mention of anything related to money, investment, or painting moons as an investment.

[https://np.reddit.com/community-points/](https://np.reddit.com/community-points/)

# 

# 3- Centralization of the token.

Since Moons are a social media token for a specific site, it's expected that it would be heavily centralized, if not completely.

Reddit created the token, and the admins have laid out the basic vision and core principles of Moons. But beyond those core principles, users are free to vote on any other changes they want about distributions, how moons work outside those core principles, and even vote on new features, and changes for the sub.

So they gave back a lot of the control back to the users and the sub.

The token itself runs on a decentralized network. It's an Ethereum token that runs on Arbitrum Nova. Once you get them, it's out of the hands of Reddit. However, the smart contract is still controlled by Reddit.

So you have some aspects that make it less centralized than expected, and Reddit willingly removing their centralized authority, but in the end it still remains centralized at its core, as you would expect for something designed for a private site.

&#x200B;

# 4- Centralization of the governance.

Is the governance also too centralized?  Are the people in charge in control of most of the governance? Is a small group in control of the governance?

Here's how the distribution works:

\-50% go to users. Who receive governance.

\-10% go to mods. Who also receive governance. And a discretionary portion of that 10% go back to the community in the form of rewards, prizes, etc...

\-40% go to Reddit. Those Moons don't participate in governance. A portion of it is what gets burned for things like the membership. And a portion can sometimes be returned to the community, like when they reimburse users for distribution errors.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4idw4ygb9ina1.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=def821371d5647ee9a1e3260bff78832453d78c8

The Reddit wallet doesn't participate in the governance. And a portion of the mod distribution goes back to the users.

So the majority of governance is in the hands of the users. And a little less than 10% is controlled by the mods.

So who actually holds the governance power? Here's a rough estimate based on latest numbers:

&#x200B;

[\*Numbers not exact, due to a lot of burned and lost moons to be estimated\*](https://preview.redd.it/m8zti12d9ina1.png?width=866&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c205c5d7bb321635b8e2c2914bdb1c4dc065cfc2)

I don't know that many coins where there's very little of the governance in the hands of the team, and over 90% going to users.

However, there is a caveat in that seemingly strong decentralization. Mods have a veto power on what proposals can be presented.

&#x200B;

# 5- Tech and solutions.

What solutions do moons provide?

They solve several problems for social media, like finding a way to reward content creators without relying on ads, provide engagement, create more participation, and attract more users.

Along with giving their users more voice, and a piece of the community.

It has also functioned as a token for many features like tipping, be the reward token for contests and games, buying special membership, purchasing banners and AMA, be the currency for the sub's merchandise, etc...

It has also expanded outside of the sub, and functioned as a the currency for subs paying Moons in exchange for services, and a sort of OnlyFans version with Moons.

&#x200B;

# 6- What is the mechanism of moons, and are there any signs of scam, rugpull, or bad tokenomics.

Moons are an Ethereum ERC-20 token on Abritrum Nova. They are run by an Ethereum smart contract, and work like your usual ERC-20 token.

They work as a social media reward token on Reddit, distributed for free for community participation. So while they have the function of an Ethereum token, they aren't primarily for buying a cup of coffee. Although, if a merchant wanted to accept Moons and sell you a cup of coffee for Moons, they could.

Moons are designed to be inflationary, and have no true supply cap. Moons will perpetually get re-introduced, but with smaller distributions.

This is because the focus is on utility. Admins want Moon distribution to continue in the future, to be able to function as intended, and not become too hard to earn.

**This is the opposite of the typical mechanism of a scam.**

There's also no cost to earning Moons. While you could buy them on exchanges, it's fairly easy to earn a lot of Moons for free.

**Typically, scams don't give things away for free.**

Moons are a governance token, and its functions can be decided by the community. And the majority of the community controls the governance.

**It's hard to control a scam, when the community has too much control.**

Could someone rugpull Moons?

Even if the mods got together to rug Moons through a proposal, they don't have sufficient voting power. Their only edge is they can veto proposals, but they can't force a proposal they put forward, that the community doesn't want.

Even many whales colluding can't control the governance.

But some big whales could manipulate the price.

It's getting a little harder now that there's growing liquidity, and it's now been added on two major exchanges with more volume.

Only Reddit can really rug Moons. While the Moons you own are yours, and Reddit can't touch them, the utility depends on Reddit. If they decide to discontinue the use of Moons or RCP, then the main utility of Moons would be gone.

You can still use them elsewhere, and build something with them and create new utility. But the original utility will no longer be there.

&#x200B;

# TL;DR:

No, they aren't a scam coin, and are missing too many key properties of a scam coin.

In fact, many of its feature are the very opposite of what scam and shitcoins normally do. But it's not immune to rugpulls.

The growing utility, and a focus on innovative social media solutions, is also moving them too far from the realm of traditional ""shitcoins"".

It's however a centralized coin at its core, as you would expect for a token meant to be used on a social media platform. But Reddit moves some of that centralization away from itself, and allow for users and communities to have a voice on their RCPs. The governance side, however, is decentralized (more so than most governance coins) , with some caveat on vetoed proposals, but is giving the average user significant power."

13/3/23,The attack on crypto failed!,"It seems like it was just yesterday, when all was well in the world of bankers and we were witnessing the biggest coordinated attack on crypto ever. 

CEO’s and managers of the banks were taking huge bonuses and laughing while they drive home in their Porsches.

“The attack on crypto is working they said, to their other billionaire friends. Soon crypto will collapse and everyone will move back to fiat”

Turns out, they were wrong and the opposite happened. All of the crypto FUD took our eyes off of what was actually happening at these banks. They were in trouble, big trouble.

The banks were failing fast due to the quick FED increases and bad investment decisions on the banks part. 

It only took one weekend for a 300 billion dollar bank to fail, two other banks failed as well. 

People started panicking. All
Of Reddit claimed things would get worse. Much worse!

The government came to the rescue once again. There was no way they were letting their billionaire buddies lose a bunch of their money. 

Biden said “Not on my watch!”

They decided to bail out these banks and provide unlimited liquidity to this fragile system. 

Solidifying that crypto is indeed the better option. 

Crypto might not have been backed one to one in the past, and still might not be, but neither are banks. 

The masses realized that crypto can actually be trusted, and banks can’t be. The attack on crypto failed and once again all was well in the world of crypto. Bitcoin moved 22% the day after the bail out was announced.

They attacked us, humiliated us, but we came back stronger. We always will come back stronger. Crypto is the future and banks are not.

Mass FOMO is coming, with the economy continuing to go to shit, the regulators constantly failing to do their job to protect us, and the banks showing their true colours. One of the biggest crypto bull runs in history is coming. 

Bitcoin will continue to be a safe haven for investor money and institutional money. 

We are not going anywhere!

All that during a weekend of fear where banks had closed anyway.","After the last weeks FUD and fear all around the banking sector, first with the fallout of Silvergate but in a better manner then the sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Both banks had a lot of exposure to Crypto and the contagion obviously spreads, one way was through USDC. A $40B stablecoin depegging and now re-pegging.

All of this had put uncertainty in the markets and people are trying to combat it, some by trying to withdraw their assets from exchanges as they could just as much collapse and other through depositing to exchanges to leave the market entirely. Both are transactions, so transactions are the way to combat this situation.

Here we can see the transactions going through the memory pools of Bitcoin, those have just hit an ATH which is even higher than the fallout during LUNA in May 2022 and the FTX collapse in November 2022. Showing how users are trying out everything to combat this crisis.

Once again here is the chart with the transactions at an high amount going from and to exchanges, right now we mostly have from exchanges showing how once again people have started to take self-custody in the eye of this crisis.

It is also important to note that all of this is happening during a weekend, where banks, which have caused this turmoil, are not even open but Bitcoin is operating at all-time highs.

13/3/23,The Sunk Cost Fallacy: Why sometimes you should sell it even if you lose money.,"Greetings from Portugal. 

The sunk cost fallacy is the human tendency to continue with a strategy, course, or method even tho it isn't working because of the amount of time and money they have already spent in it.

Sometimes you know you invested in a sh*tcoin that's not going to recover. But often people put more money into a deadcoin trying to recover, instead of selling at a loss.

We all saw this recently with Luna, for example.

In fact if you look at 'maxi' communities, 90% of them are just bagholders from the last bull runs who got married to their bags and didn't know how to take profits.

Please don't take this to mean that you shouldn't hold onto your cryptocurrency if you DYOR and you're sure about the long term value; rather, it means that if you find a better chance elsewhere, you should seize it rather than holding onto one that you no longer trust.

So be careful not to become overly attached to a project."

It can be quite emotional and extremely scary if you’re new in the space or are over leveraged. 

Anything can happen here, although I personally think the worst is over, things could go the other way as well. Nobody knows what the FED will say tomorrow. 

So let’s be honest with each other here, who panic sold in the last couple days, and did you FOMO back in?"

13/3/23,Brave enables converting cryptocurrencies to fiat within the browser,"The privacy-focused web browser Brave has announced a new feature that allows users to not only buy cryptocurrencies, but also sell them for fiat - including US dollars, euros, and British pounds - without leaving the integrated Brave Wallet.

Cryptocurrency storage services are developing rapidly, and the browser closely associated with the BAT token aims to facilitate the storage process with a new feature supported by the startup Ramp Network.

The creators announced the latest update via their social media profile on Twitter.

&#x200B;

>""Centralized exchanges mishandled customer funds. That's why offering a secure and easy-to-manage wallet to handle your assets is more important than ever.""

 https://twitter.com/brave/status/1634239435423268878?s=20 

Brave is an open-source internet browser with a built-in cryptographic wallet. Unlike other internet browsers, it blocks ads and tracking modules by default. The official wallet for the browser associated with the BAT token was originally a fork of MetaMask. However, as the project progressed, the development team decided that a higher level of security and privacy could only be achieved through an integrated cryptographic wallet built into the browser.

# The latest update to Brave enables crypto-to-fiat conversion 

According to the creators of the internet browser, users in some countries can now sell 38 cryptocurrencies by exchanging them directly for fiat. The list of cryptocurrencies includes Ethereum, Solana, and the project's native token, BAT.

>""While self-service has gained popularity over the last decade, centralized exchanges remain the most common way to store digital currencies and tokens. We expect changes to come through user experience innovations like the one we are announcing today.""

13/3/23,[Serious] SVB's failure is not the same as FTX and a bailout does not mean the printer goes brrr,"There are many SVB posts and comments going around today in this sub that are taking great liberties with what is actually going on with SVB's failure.

**SVB's failure is like FTX's failure**

Businesses fail, not all leaders are good leaders, but what happened with SVB is very different than FTX. SVB ended the year with $209 billion in assets and $175 billion in deposits. This is book value and SVB had large amounts of 10-year bonds that are paying less than 2% interest. Many of these assets are worth less than the book value, but the issue is liquidity. SVB is not liquid enough to withstand a bank run.

Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX made customers' money just disappear, there was blatant fraud. AlixPartners spent 2,545 hours in February trying to figure out where the money disappeared to. 

This is not to say that there was no fraud involved with SVB, but the SVB failure has very different fundamentals than FTX.

**The FDIC is making the money printer go brrrrrrr**

Yes, the FDIC technically has the ability to turn on the money printer, but that is not what is currently happening with SVB. The FDIC's plan is not to turn on the money printer Monday morning and make all \~$175 billion available for immediate withdrawal. There are thoughts that \~30% to 50% will be available for uninsured deposits at the beginning of business on Monday. There currently is an auction underway for SVB with hopes to be able to repay all deposits with the proceeds. 

There might be some government money used later in the process, but the money printer is not going brrrr right now and SVB's assets are being used to repay the debts.

13/3/23,I remember when a big talking point for Bitcoin and crypto at large was giving the consumer the ability to truly be their own bank,"Seeing all of this chaos with the Silicon Valley Bank just makes me feel like we still need to really help individuals understand why being your own bank matters so much. We shouldn't need to rely on the US Treasury or FDIC to insure our funds are safe. Obviously banks are unable to properly assess and manage risk in the ways they should to protect depositors funds. Despite crypto falling down this last weekend in the midst of all this news, long term I still believe that this strengthens the argument that individuals need more control over their own funds rather than trusting big or small banks with their money. It feels like we need to get back to some of the fundamental conversations that underscored the entire reasons behind why crypto was invented in the first place as that particular reason feels extremely relevant at this moment in time."

With a ever growing audience recently and new  investors that want to explore more about Moons and its potential, there is also an increase in investment, and for that to flourish we needed liquidity, which is luckily lately getting stronger every day.

Now, not everyone can afford to spend hours per day posting and commenting here in this sub. You know, life often has other plans. Work, family, hobbies and other things often can prevent many of us in investing our time and effort in getting Moons.

That made me think and I wanted to perform a simple but effective experiment.

# What would happen if you performed a regular monthly DCA with a start date of January 1st 2022 until March 1st 2023 into Moons with a budget of $100 per month?

Well, lets get the sheet rolling:

[DCA Date is on the 1st of every month \(except September, where I took the closing price from September 11th\)](https://preview.redd.it/baojyguj1kna1.png?width=430&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=20bc821d19c799be7e4e0fc822bb718531bc94f9)

The results? Well:

# TOTAL INVESTMENT (15 months): $1,500.00

# TOTAL MOONS COLLECTED: 19,877.10 MOONS

# TOTAL VALUE AS OF TODAY's ATH (March 13th): $6,022.76

# RETURNS: +301.51%

These results are quite remarkable if you consider that this investment strategy is performed in the middle of a Bear Market!

No doubt high interest rates are purging the system and crypto and speculative tech are the first to go.

However, isn't this also how the US government attacks organized crime and ""terrorist"" states?  Cut off the funding and the system withers.  No more registered crypto banks, then no more registered crypto companies, then no more mass adoption.

I've been trying to get past false dichotomies.  This doesn't have to be either an overlevereged system or a government plot, it could be both.  Maybe they're seizing this opportunity to do what they were planning to do anyway."
13/3/23,Have more than one cryto exchange account for backup,"In the crypto world, even a very sophiscated investor can fall into a fraud like ftx. For such situation, it is important to constantly look out for red flag and be ready for exit. That is why always have your backup ready in case you need  to exit.

As all of you know due to regulatory compliance, you need to submit your documentation for verification of your identity and that would usually take some time and more during peak  periods. Thus If you only have one cryto exchange account by the time you sense a problem and want to exit, it may be too late. Take me for example, I got a whatapps msg from my friend about CZ's tweet selling everything while I am on the subway commuting to work. I immediately do the transfer on the packed train with my mobile with people crowded around me during travelling peak hour. I was lucky that i had just created another crypto exchange account a few weeks ago before this as my friends reminded me about having a ready backup for fund deposit. 
Lucky for me I took my friend's advice that is why I can still afford my favourite brand of chunky peanut butter thickly spread every day for my breakfast now. And so with the USDC saga going on, it reminded me to pass this advice on so that some of you could be lucky like me to escape just in case."

13/3/23,"Many crypto investors lack basic street smartness. If some random person on a street approach you and make you great offer they probably have ""knife hidden behind their back"". The same in crypto, if something is too good to be true you are the prey.","Not failing for most crypto scams is not matter of being crypto educated, it is matter of using basic human logic and minimal social awareness + being  internet user for at least few months. It is scary most people are so gullible.  I am a bit curious how no one mugged or scammed them in  their real life, they must live in some utopian village when no one close the door. 

Average person should be smart enough to not believe randoms in the internet (come one, scammers in DMs ot fake e-mails exist since 1990's it is nothing new) and to now believe in too good to be true offers. How you can even life your life if you believe anyone like last fool, you shouldn't trust everyone. There are  maybe 10 people in the internet I trust and only cause I know them for veeery long time. If some account with 1 karma DM me on Reddit saying ""Hi"" or ""Hello"" I don't need to be Sherlock Holmes to know it is scam. Even if I wouldn't be in crypto it still would be a scam, no one real in the internet ever will message you like that.


Maybe it is me growing in city in europe, but come on, you should be able to be at least a bit street smart if you want to succeed in life. Investors  especially should be able to tell cheap tricks and see simple manipulation. If you would work on Wallstreet or just in average company you would get kicked after first day if you would believe in APY that is 30% a month. Even my grandma would be able to tell it is a scam. If you still need to ask ""Guys I found this new project they promise to make everyone millionaire"" lack of crypto knowledge is last of your problems, cause that mean you also have zero general economic and investing knowledge and are too trustworthy to be responsible for any money bigger than lunch money. At least where I live people on the street will try to scam you at least few times a month, charm of city with tourists... Everyone over age of 10 or 12 learn to auto assume anyone that approach you randomly  on the street want to sell you something not worth it or scam you, if nothing worse. Maybe it is a bit part of european culture, but I don't think anywhere in the world  people will chit-chat with you if they have no business in doing so.

If you don't think if something in crypto is a scam just convert it into non crypto situation. Imagine guy on street approach you and tell you can get you 10% profit on your money every month, would you believe him? What if he told you he will double your money, just gave them to him and tomorrow he will come back with double amount?
Of course you not trust him, you would either thought they deal drugs or want to scam you. No one is stupid enough to believe in this (if you would believe in offer like that anyway just stop investing for your own good and enjoy being poor, cause you will lose all your money sooner or later anyway). Then why you believe even more unsustainable profits in crypto? Money aren't free and no one will give you crazy APY just like that. If you someone does, they are predator and your are a prey, somehow this offer will backfire at you.

Only people you should trust are those you know. Don't assume random person that DM you or some new project is worth your trust. In crypto it is not trustworty until proven otherwise, it is untrustworty until hard facts will prove otherwise. Scammers and hackers are everywhere, don't make their job easier."

We as crypto and blockchain enthusiasts, do love to say how we want crypto to replace the current system. But ideally, we want it to happen in a more smooth fashion, and with less of a catastrophic implosion of the current system. 

People die during currency destruction, and sadly, the cracks happening this early into the rate hiking cycle (4.5%) are pretty concerning. The last CPI figures showed that we probably need to get near 6% to cross the threshold on inflation.  Obviously this is all just my own opinion and speculation, but dang, do yourself a favor and stack food, water, guns, ammo, Sats and Gold. Any hedge will do, because we could be going through a really tough period. See ya Tuesday!"

**Turns out if I had $100 invested in the coin at the time of shilling (so $1,400 total) it would have been worth $3,633 today. Almost 2.6 times the investment**

Recently, Euler Finance, a decentralized finance platform, suffered a massive flash loan attack leading to the theft of over $195 million worth of decentralized stablecoins and synthetic ERC-20 tokens. The attack exploited a vulnerability in the platform's code by utilizing a flash loan to borrow an immense amount of digital assets, causing the platform's liquidity pools to decrease significantly. By doing so, the attacker managed to manipulate the prices of certain assets in their favor, allowing them to swap tokens at a lower price and sell them at a higher one. Euler Finance has reassured its users that they will receive reimbursement for their lost funds, and they are currently working on improving their code to prevent future attacks. The severity of this breach serves as a reminder of the risks associated with decentralized finance platforms and the need for constant vigilance and security measures."

So the circulating supply is lower and even though its a little over ten years old i still think we're in the beginning of crypto so who knows how many more coins will be lost in the next 10 years.

People say not to look at the supply and market cap to determine the price in the future. If at this point BTC reached 1 trillion market cap it would be around 50k, and 10 trillion which who knows when it would be 500k?

So with that math and lets say BTC stayed the same price for all of 2023 and someone invested $50 a month = $600 end of year , that means that $600 maybe worth 12k someday when BTC is 500K right? or do you think it will be worth more because coins will be lost. What other factors would determine the investments value. Not everyone has 100's or 1000's of dollars to invest every month  so what would you tell someone who doesn't have much money to invest that there small investment are still worth it.

Lets say 500k BTC is 15-20 years away thats a long time to turn $600 into 12k many may not even see it as worth it."

>We are working hard to find an alternative provider to continue offering GBP deposits and withdrawals to our users. 

>We apologise for any inconvenience caused while we resolve this matter.  


This is quite annoying as I use Binance. Unfortunately no timelines given for when they expect to get a new partner, but looking at the way crypto and general market is we brits may be high and dry.  

More and more I think about moving everything over to kraken. This seems like a good excuse to consolidate all the shit I’ve collected and just get it gone."
13/3/23,Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade summary!,"LESS than a month until the SHANGHAI UPGRADE!  
  
In case you weren't aware, below are the list of changes included in the Shanghai Upgrade:  
  
EIP-3651: Warm COINBASE, reduce gas fees on COINBASE. Previously, Accessing COINBASE is overpriced because the address is initially cold under the access list framework introduced in EIP-2929. So, the first time we access accounts, it will cost 2600 gas, and for account storage, it will cost 2100 gas. However, if the state already accessed is now ""warm"", it can be reaccessed cheaply, i.e., around 100 gas. This will save around 2500 gas in case of account access.  
  
EIP-3855: PUSH0 instruction. Introduce a new instruction PUSH0, that pushes zero when called in the contract code. Right now, it is achieved by different means, costing additional gas and deployment time.  
  
EIP-3860: Limit and meter initcode. Will limit the max size of initcode to 49152. This will ensure fair gas calculation of initcode and simplify EVM engines to minimize failure risks.  
  
EIP-4895: Beacon Chain push withdrawals as operations. The most impactful EIP that was approved for the Shanghai hard fork  
  
EIP-6049: Deprecate SELFDESTRUCT. Meta EIP that doesn't require a node client upgrade. This EIP will deprecate the SELFDESTRUCT opcode by giving developers a warning. Later, EIP-4758 will completely deactivate it in the next Cancun hard fork.  
  
Key Takeaways:  
  
\- The Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade is a hard fork scheduled to occur in March 2023.  
  
\- Stakers and validators will be able to withdraw staked ETH from the Beacon Chain.  
  
\- Approximately 16 million staked ETH will be available for withdrawal.  
  
\- In addition to EIP-4895, there are several other EIPs in the Shanghai fork, most of which aim to lower gas costs for Ethereum developers.  
  
\- The withdrawal of staked ETH has been successfully simulated on the Zhejiang testnet."

13/3/23,Hackers steal around $200 million from crypto lender Euler Finance,
13/3/23,Over $500 million in crypto liquidated as the crypto market seems major gains across the entire sector,"Liquidations for BTC and ETH are sitting at $115  and $100 million respectively as the market continues to rocket upward benefitted by short liquidations from last week.

You can see more coin liquidations over at coinglass.com for real time stats to see what coins are crushing it as this pump continues.

BTC alone has has over 36% if total hedged (and unhedged) shorts liquidated in the last 24 hours adding to the speed of this price action.

News of the SVB bank collapsing and not gaining a bailout seems to have benefitted the crypto space and may explain some of the major losses earlier in the week this last month (banks and investors hedging against the bank and covering positions) https://www.barrons.com/articles/no-bailout-for-svb-heres-what-to-expect-d1a9ddc8

Further price action to the upside seems to be holding strong for the short term as most coins are nearing 15% or higher gains on the day, we may see a retest of some key levels in the coming week, but I suspect volatility will continue to stay fairly high. 

There are still many financial woes to work through with legacy banking that has further tied itself to the larger crypto market and those functions and decisions will make waves. (Especially the whales)

Overall I expect a short pullback at some point soon with a follow-up run to retesting early month highs."
13/3/23,Are we finally seeing a divergence between crypto and tech stocks?,"Most days, crypto follows very closely to the NASDAQ and tech stocks. As tech stocks rise, so does BTC, ETH and most cryptos. 

Today, we are seeing a bit of a divergence. SPY, and NASDAQ are flat to slightly negative, but BTC and ETH are both up close to 10%.

What this is telling me is that investors are still wary of the fallout from SVB, Signature, and Silvergate, and potential bank runs for other smaller banks. And this is even with the government stepping in and bailing out SVB!

I think people are really seeing the benefits of something like BTC and crypto in general, as it's one of the safest places you can put your money now. We used to think money in our checking account was safe. Guess not so much anymore.

Hopefully this will help spark the next bull run for crypto!"

13/3/23,Take a deep breath and think,"There is lots of disbelief about the state of the markets today, but my title says it all. Before you act emotionally and 🚀 💰 💵🥳 into a geostationary orbit - just stop and think.

- the bank business itself and investors get nothing
- has the macroeconomic outlook improved? No. It’s gotten worse as [Silvergate, SVB, and Signature have failed](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/12/signature-svb-silvergate-failures-effects-on-crypto-sector.html), and financing tech/crypto companies will be more challenging

- what happened to USDC? The stable coin de-pegged; what shouldn’t happen ended up happening

The markets don’t look as bad as anybody predicted but we’re not better off. Things have gotten considerably worse. Please temper your joy and don’t lose sight of the larger picture. I don’t think this will be a long lived rally, because there really isn’t anything to support it.

This part is financial advice: don’t FOMO/YOLO/etc. talk to a financial advisor about your risk tolerance and family about the need for invested money.

Edit: let’s not forget that many companies had more than $250,000 deposited and those billions aren’t FDIC insured. The de-pegging of USDC is very familiar considering Terra/Luna. What have you learned from Terra/Luna that you can apply to this situation?"

So I just saw a twee from CZ, shown below, which basically says Binance will convert $1billion BUSD in native assets, to include BNB, ETH and BNB.

In the comments I read many people rejoicing, and some comparing it to a *"" Industry recovery initiative in full force"".* On the flipside you have people saying ""*we are letting them getaway with selling their fake dollars before the rug pull and people applaud"".*

I personally this investment is what the market needs at the moment, and hopefully this could be a catalyst for something bigger for 2023 but at the same time I wonder if this is truly a bad thing?

>Given the changes in stable coins and banks, [#Binance](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Binance?src=hashtag_click)📷 will convert the remaining of the $1 billion Industry Recovery Initiative funds from BUSD to native crypto, including [#BTC](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BTC?src=hashtag_click)📷, [#BNB](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BNB?src=hashtag_click)📷 and ETH.

What are your thoughts on this? Is this good for crypto or does it invoke the opposite feeling for you?"
13/3/23,Monero,"Monero is a cryptocurrency that specialises in private and censorship-resistant transactions. Its various privacy-enhancing technologies help ensure the anonymity of its users. It is the only major cryptocurrency where every user is anonymous by default. The sender, receiver, and amount of every single transaction are hidden to all other participants on the network.

While cryptocurrencies are often touted as being anonymous, in reality most are only pseudonymous. With enough effort, a network observer would be able to trace an entity back to a real world person.

Monero is different. Its core development team’s hyper-focus on privacy means every transaction on Monero is untraceable, making it a truly fungible currency. Merchants and individuals accepting Monero do not need to worry about blacklisted or tainted coins. It achieves this increased level of privacy through three specific features: Ring Signatures, Confidential Addresses, and Ring Confidential Transactions.

**Pros:**

* **Scalability.** There is no limit to Monero’s blockchain. This scalability should prevent fees from skyrocketing as usage increases.
* **Privacy.** This is Monero’s main selling point. It offers users true anonymity by preventing others from seeing your balance. This is something that many other cryptocurrencies lack.
* **ASIC-resistant.** The majority of many types of cryptocurrencies are mined by purpose-built units known as ‘ASIC miners’. This makes them more centralised as the supply is controlled by those who possess ASIC miners. To prevent this, Monero mining can only be completed via CPUs and GPUs.
* **Fungibility.** For a currency to be fungible, it’s value can’t be influenced by its source or usage. As many cryptocurrencies can be blacklisted if, for example, they were stolen, they aren’t fungible. However, as Monero is untraceable, it is also truly fungible.

**Cons:**

* **Lack of Adoption.** Monero isn’t as widely adopted as other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which limits its use
* **Lack of wallets.** It’s more difficult to developers to work on Monero than for other cryptocurrencies. Therefore, there aren’t a lot of wallets that support Monero. 
* **Centralisation of miners.** In spite of the fact that Monero is ASIC resistant, it still hasn’t solved the problem of disproportionate control of cryptocurrencies. Three pools control over 40% of the hash rate.
* **Reputation.** The anonymity Monero offers has lead to its adoption by black markets and it is widely used on the dark web. This association may limit Monero’s widespread adoption.

**Wallets that support Monero:**

* Cake Wallet 
* Feather
* Monerujo

So if you're the kind of person that likes privacy, Monero is the coin for you!

13/3/23,Does the US prevent Banks from failing - cheap money incoming and crazy pump?,"Rumors and news indicate that several actions have been taken to prevent banks from failing.

That implies that banks have unrealized losses which WON'T turn into real losses dragging the financial system with them and creating a domino effect. **This is no different from new money coming almost for free to big players ----> crazy money will go into the stock market (and crypto?)** from banks investing again ...and the FED moderating the raise of interest, which means that inflation will stay longer than initially expected, but **I bet money flowing into BTC, the Halving in 1 year and FOMO combined will mean higher returns from BTC than the inflation to be.**

**will the almost collapse of a bank and the fear it produces initiate a crazy pump?**

13/3/23,You can earn BAT when not even using the Brave browser!,"So the Brave browser is what originally got me into crypto currency and it took me a while before I relised this small trick.

13/3/23,"Biden Speech Pushes Bitcoin Over $24,000 as Banks Halt Trading",
13/3/23,My Cheat Sheet,"My cheat sheet:

1. CPI is nearly impossible to generate for the 1st world, especially the us. They printed trillions, people didn't work, and had the most lopsided supply/demand move and the best they could get was 9% CPI. Technology and demographics make it impossible for CPI to be 2% long term. Not kind of impossible. Impossible.
2. Don't confuse asset inflation with CPI. Don't confuse CPI with debasement. Houses, while overvalued in my opinion (relative to rents), aren't in the bubble of 2008. Same with stocks.
3. Cope: It's easy to say bubble as a coping mechanism when you don't own the asset. I've seen this in real estate from 2016-2021, btc/eth for the past 5 years, and Tesla stock. Then, when where's there a big draw down, the outsiders say ""I TOLD YOU SO"". 
4. At this point, if I don't own btc or eth I'm short it. Although I own some alts, I use these because of their market cap. If you don't own nasdaq or real estate or the dow, you are effectively short them. Sitting in cash is being short. Whether you want to admit it or not.
5. Even if CPI was going to 5-6% naturally (due to real supply/demand), the government would simply change the formula. They cannot afford for CPI to be high.
6. The issue is debasement. More money supply with low rates. AKA paying more units for the same amount of stuff (aka bonds which we see are having issues).
7. Once technology reaches enough people, it's impossible to stop. It's like the printing press and social media. Look at China-they still can't kill crypto, and seem to be embracing it a bit via Hong Kong.
8. This time is different because people know. Reddit, twitter, etc, are enabling education-not the bs education we have been force fed, but the real facts.
9. Most people are ignorant. Ignorant doesn't mean stupid. It means unaware.  Most people will only buy when the price goes up.
10. Most people, myself included, want to feel smart. They want to trade. We see the stories of the Tesla call options, the 100x crypto trading, etc. To me the easiest trade is this: put yourself in a position where you can make more. Take the weekend job. Grind to get the promotion. Kiss ass. Whatever. Reduce expenses. Find someone that shares your vision. Are you willing to rent a studio? Willing to cook at home? Over the next 10 years, allocate, allocate, allocate."

We are writing to provide you with an update on Gemini’s banking partners in light of recent turmoil in the U.S. banking industry.We are deeply saddened to learn of the news about Signature Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, and Silvergate Bank. These banks were great partners for many years to nascent, emerging industries and helped them grow into important economic drivers of the U.S. economy.

13/3/23,I'm getting better at this,"I'm no longer an emotional slave to the market's volatility. I have restraint on the green days and/or weeks and zero fear on the red. I've been able to make aggressive purchases in the slumps and take my foot off the gas on the way up. I'm essentially doing the opposite of what I did when I entered the market.

I've also been disciplined withdrawing my crypto to cold storage. I never let my account balance on any exchange exceed more than I'm 100% comfortable losing. This means I end up transferring about once a month.

I've also developed peace with Bitcoin. It will end up doing what it's going to do, regardless of my opinion and online chatter. My bet is on Bitcoin going up forever but I'm diversified enough if an altcoin takes the reigns.

13/3/23,Could Reddit Community Points be More Valuable than Reddit Itself in the Event of an IPO?,"The recent pamping of the moons got me thinking about the potential value of Reddit Community Points. There are a ton of very popular subs, some that get significantly more traffic than /r/CryptoCurrency . If some of the major subs do issue tokens, like if /r/funny issues ""Laughs"" as a token or something, they could be even more valuable than moons. 

Moons right now have a cap around $30 million, which is no-where near what Reddit will IPO for, but what if the do spike up to around $10, and get a market cap of $1B +?

Reddit had about $350 million in revenue in 2021, meaning an IPO would likely be $10+ billion, but likely not too much more. With crypto market caps easily eclipsing that, and with potentially dozens of community tokens, is there a chance that the token ecosystem would be worth more than Reddit itself? How would the coins Reddit owns play into this?  We'll find out soon enough, but until then, it's hard to imagine a limit the value of these tokens in aggregate."

13/3/23,Opinions on Decentralization.,"Is it actually possible? 

Everyone thinks everyone's favourite project is decentralised. Others will work towards it. 
However, the definitions of real decentralisation depends on the person and the project it seems. 

From my very limited understanding. 

BTC is decentralised? It's the future? It's fair? 

I don't get it. There are  billions of people who's not even heard of bitcoin. Billions of people who's yet to purchase bitcoin.  However,  handful of people / coprations who owns so much of it that they are able to manipulate is price. Everyone here is instantly at a advantage Vs those who haven't gotten any or have access to getting any. 
No avarage person can mine it or contribute to it in a meaningful way. 

So is the network is decentralised, but the value is not? 
I'm not just talking about BTC you can put your own coin name if you wish. 

Is it that no crypto is really truly decentralised, but it's how far we can strive to achieve the main components of  decentralisation? 


Lastly, What's the point? 

I mean I personally don't have a saying in changing the colour of my bank notes. But I can get a team together work at it for few years and possibly change the colour. 

I don't have any saying on the BTC or ETH. 
But together we have? 

Just like we can sue a bank or take down a government or vote? 



Thanks in advance."
13/3/23,The start of a bull?,"How insane would it be...and here me out...if a historic bank run on a massive bank in the USA is the start of a bull run.

The variables that make me belive this are true are as follows.

The money printer was turned on during covid which caused unprecedented inflation. The solution was quantitive tightening via rate hikes from the federal reserve. The markets did not like this so everything started to go down.

The rate hikes climbed and up until last Friday there wasn't a black swan on the traditional markets yet...then BOOM, a major bank goes out. The fed and the treasury decide to make depositors whole, and usdc repegs to the dollar sometime last night.

This is where it's gets interesting. The fed might not be able to raise interest rates and more due to the reprocussions those rates are having WITH REGUALR BANKS.

The markets have been waiting for a pivot. I don't think they care if it's a voluntary pivot or a forced pivot.

BTC through this whole 3 days said ""call an ambulance! But not for me""

It up 10 percent since Friday during the biggest collapse in traditional finance since 2008.

Call me crazy but if everything goes well today we might be in the start of something big and bull shaped."

In my opinion, we should be seeing Bitcoin and the rest of the market run. People should be buying. This, what's happening now, is WHY we are here.

13/3/23,"Is the US government resorting to unconventional tactics to attack crypto? If not the government, someone big is playing at something.","Just six months ago, the world's biggest exchange, Binance, announced that they would stop supporting USDC. They would be removing trading for USDC pairs and instead supporting 'their' stablecoin BUSD.  This seemed weird at the time. Now, with the benefit of hindsight, seeing everything else play out, we have to know there was alot going on behind the scenes. Maybe most of us forgot about this, but it happened. And now it seems relevant.

A couple of months later, someone caused a 'bankrun' on FTX. People rushed to withdraw money from FTX, it didn't have enough to honour withdrawals and collapsed.  Obviously, had SBF not misappropriated customers money, FTX wouldn't have failed, so I'm not trying to lessen his responsibility . But ultimately, had the bank run not occurred, FTX would still be around and we'd never have known about all the crap that was going on there and with Alameda.

Then, someone caused a 'bankrun' on Binance. Withdrawals spiked significantly, and the CEO took to Twitter multiple times to try assure customers their funds were safe. Fortunately they handled withdrawals and the crisis seemed to pass.

A couple of days ago, someone caused a bankrun on Silicon Valley Bank. That bank was a major partner for crypto and that's now bust.

It follows Silvergate, another pro crypto bank going bust, that had been under pressure from Senators Warren, Kennedy and Marshall.

Now we hear that Signature Bank has collapsed.

In amongst all of this, BUSD has been killed by government pressure. Now Binance claim its not theirs - basically issued by Paxos nothing to do with them? $20b stablecoin destroyed. The stablecoin at the start of this sequence of events.

In Circle's latest transparancy report, they shouw their cash held at 7 banks. **3 of those** just happen to be the **3 banks that have collapsed** so far.  They show 42,335,734,074 of reserves to cover 42,288,053,870 of USDC. Thats like 1/10th of a percent buffer.

It can't be easy organizing a bank run, but 'someone' has now pulled that off three times.

The government is clearly going against crypto. The SEC's talk about securities and action against Kraken. New York's actions against KuCoin.

Could the government be this powerful 'someone' causing the bank runs? And what's next?"

13/3/23,POLL: What will happen to cryptocurrency companies with their banking now that the two most crypto friendly banks have gone under?,"The elephant in the room right now for US based crypto founders ""who do we bank with now?"" 

&#x200B;

SVB has been aquired by HSBC , a bank which has barred customers from interacting with cryptocurrencies in multiple ways such as using a credit card, and imposing limits for debit. This may change but for now these barriers were implemented February 2023. So what is going to happen? I do not see anyone discussing this. Even then, these limitations are for retail, I imagine businesses have even more restrictions.  


If you believe larger banks will step in, it is important to note that most of the large banks have recently 'derisked' their crytpocurrency exposure. Most crypto based companies cannot get traditional business credit, loans, etc from these banks as they do not meet the requirements. These include monthly or stable revenue. Most projects are building an MVP and looking to raise funding before or after, this often requires a business loan. Even companies that have raised money from VCs are often denied because traditional loans require monthly revenue. So what do you guys think is going to happen?

1. **Volatility** (25%): It measures the current value of BTC with averages from the last 30 and 90 days.
2. **Market momentum/volume** (25%): Trading volume and market momentum are compared with the previous 30 and 90 day averages and then combined.
3. **Social media** (15%): It checks the number of Twitter hashtags related to Bitcoin and its interaction rate.
4. **Bitcoin dominance** (10%). Measures BTC's dominance of the market.
5. **Google Trends** (10%): It also checks Google Trends data for Bitcoin search queries.
6. **Survey results** (15%). It was used a long time ago but it is currently paused.

As you can see it takes some interesting data into consideration. I am sure that if they added Reddit to it social media it would always be Extreme Greed.

13/3/23,"SVB Didn't fail because of crypto, nor the Fed.","Just read this article which is pretty interesting if you want to understand what caused SVB to fail.

http://www.investing.com/analysis/disastrous-risk-management-is-not-the-feds-fault-200636146

It looks like it wasnt crypto and it wasn't Fed policy. They simply didn't manage their interest rate risks on treasury holdings. When treasury yields rise prices fall. This caused the bank to need to realize losses on their Treasury portfolio when depositors withdrew their money which quickly made the bank insolvent. Had that just hedged interest rate risks it seems the bank probably wouldn't have failed."

Let us consider how they function. 

ZK works based on a system where a verifier who is known as the sequencer checks the data off-chain.

That can work great for some things. Certainly great for a transaction. Or something like a ID.

 But everything? 

Can it provide a truly private DeFi? Would it be decentralized, without a central point of failure? 

I think this is where it gets muddy. There is some excellent research and work getting done out there, and a lot of money getting thrown at it. I hope it evolves, I truly do. 

But I tend to think that we need more than one solution to the huge issue that is privacy in Web3. I can not see a world that adopts crypto without users having data controls."

Knowing beforehand that this is 99.99% a scam, I still wanna know what the procedure would be. I am aware that he is asking us to take a picture and upload somewhere as an NFT, and make it kind of like a unique virtual piece of art that only himself will own? Also, making this picture has a fee, how expensive is this?

Then, is there any secure way of proceeding with the transaction? Any softwares to make it safe? (i.e. Metamask i guess...) Sorry that I am a complete newbie on the crypto market, thank you so much in advance

Edit: SORRY, NFT not NHT...

Edit 2: I would just like to know the procedure, what steps would be taken for ""uploading"" the artworks to whatever place it is, and sell them, since the scammer didnt provide any link yet (that's what makes it weird, they usually give a fake URL to scam you)"

Ok, so I know this had been asked loads of times but I've read all those and I'm still not totally clear on the process, and I don't want to fuck it up, obviously.

I've already moved BTC and ETH so I understand how that works and I also understand that LRC is an ETH token. But do I have to specifically add LRC to my Trezor before sending it, as in activate it or something? Or I just send it in the exact same way as I would send ETH and then it will just show up as LRC?

I've got the basic Trezor, if that makes a difference, I forget what it's called.

It's just I can see the list of tokens on Trezor Suite but obviously LRC isn't specifically mentioned so I want to check if it has to show up before I can send to it. 

Oh and also, how come when you scan the ETH receiving address to Binance it offers you BNB network as well as ETH?  I did a trial send of 0.5 LRC via BNB because the fees were nothing, but I think it got lost. I just don't understand why receiving addresses trigger options for different networks, if only one network is valid? Thanks!"

13/3/23,A question about addresses and safety,"Let's say somebody will soon receive 10 BTC.  They intend to hold it for a very long time, as if it's their future retirement savings.

Once they receive the 10 BTC, should they keep it in the address they received it at, or should they split it up by sending it to separate addresses, like maybe 1 BTC each?

That's the question.

This is not me!  I wish!  This was just a hypothetical question somebody asked me, and I didn't have an answer so I figured I'd ask the experts here.

Before anybody asks about wallets, etc, assume they have a hardware wallet set up with a passphrase and have secured their seed.  This is strictly a question about storing Bitcoin at an address.

Obviously, you should use a new address for each transaction, but what's the best practice for when you receive a large amount of Bitcoin in a single transaction and intend to hold it for years?

**EDIT:**  I guess this isn't the place to ask technical questions.  Nobody seems to even read the question.

**I'm not asking about multiple seeds.**  A single seed has millions of addresses.  I figured you guys know that.  The question is, should it be sent to 1 address or split up into multiple addresses, considering that it'll sit there for decades.  What's the best practice?

**They already have a hardware wallet.**  So, saying ""Buy a hardware wallet"" shows you didn't read the question.  It looks like most folks are typing answers before even reading the question."
13/3/23,Are You Using Brave Browser Yet?,"I am a Brave user and have been for about 4 months now. I really wish I began using it earlier being it's an awesome crypto project (BAT) with an even better product (the browser itself). 

I think the idea of BAT could be scaled across a variety of platforms. I think we will see social platforms such as twitter begin to implement their own form of BAT where they pay users for viewing ads. Though, in the long run I think it would make sense for BAT to expand their offering to companies who would like to implement some form of reward to their users for viewing ads or essentially being the product.

For those who are unfamiliar with Brave, here are a few high level bullet points of why I believe it is better than any other browser out there today. 

&#x200B;

1. Privacy: Brave Browser is built with privacy in mind. It blocks ads and trackers, preventing websites from collecting your data without your consent. Say goodbye to targeted ads and hello to a more private browsing experience.
2. Speed: Brave Browser is incredibly fast, thanks to its ad-blocking technology. Pages load faster, allowing you to browse the web more efficiently.
3. Rewards: Brave Browser rewards users with its own cryptocurrency, called Basic Attention Token (BAT), for opting into ads. This means that you can earn cryptocurrency simply by browsing the web like you normally would.
4. Crypto Wallet: Brave Browser also has a built-in crypto wallet, making it easy to manage your cryptocurrency assets without having to switch between different apps.
5. Security: Brave Browser uses state-of-the-art security measures to protect you from phishing attempts, malware, and other threats.

&#x200B;

For people who aren't your everyday crypto people I understand they are useful when it comes to loans/DeFi, holding crypto in a card like CDC and knowing you have x amount (which brings up a question why not just swap to fiat), and pairs. 

And I understand outside of the USA they are stable to get around some tax systems which only tax you when you transfer into crypto or use it to buy a good or service. Some places it is easy to find stores that accept crypto. And so on. So I'm not saying there is NO use or no use unless you're a bit more advance compared to the normal crypto person.

I did this to remind you of the risks of providing liquidity, even if it is for a good cause. Remember to **always** do your calculations and **assess your risks when investing**. Providing liquidity is something you should do to *support a project*, not something you should do out of *desire for profit* and this calculation will demonstrate why:

Disclaimer: I picked 3-day intervals to compress the data. I did the full dataset of daily calculations and the results don't look much different. So just pick your closest entry date and it won't look much different.

\*\*\*\*PNL based purely on the number of ETH/Moons received when breaking the LP, not the combined $ value of the tokens received

&#x200B;

Now this certainly doesn't look too bad, doesn't it? Regardless of your entry date your losses through IL will mostly be offset by the generous APR and accrued trading fees.

However, this is based on current price movement and historical data of the last 16 days.

Considering all the ""Moons to 1$"" posts we have here, lets quickly do the maths on some estimated scenarios on how Impermanent losses would turn out, shall we?

|ETH Price|Moon Price|IL considering an entry today (03/13)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1500|0.25|\-0.00%|
|1500|0.50|\-5.83%|
|1500|1.00|\-20.7%|

|2000|0.50|\-2.09%|
|2000|1.00|\-13.55%|
|3000|0.25|\-5.61%|
|3000|0.50|\-0.00%|
|3000|1.00|\-5.83%|

\*Based on 1662$ (ETH) and 0.2750$ (Moon) as of the making of this post at 03/13

So, yeah. If you provide liquidity, you absolutely do not want moons to shoot to 1$ *right now.* But a considerable rise of both ETH and Moons in tandem looks pretty good with negligible Impermanent losses (considering the generous APR).

&#x200B;

TLDR:

Most Liquidity providers since the implementation of CCIP-051 should be *slightly* in profit (Although less than 1% total). Accrued trading fees from the liquidity pool currently make up around 30% of the total rewards of providing liquidity."
13/3/23,Binance launches its crypto card in Colombia,
13/3/23,Yubikey: Hardware Authentication,"**A Yubikey is** a hardware authentication device that makes two-factor authentication easier by plugging it into your laptop and tapping it. Yubikeys are a type of security key manufactured by Yubico.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rwldo37zrjna1.png?width=320&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ab8afdbefbef013c78c46b95d0ba30186ad6c53e

Yubikeys use U2F (Universal 2nd Factor), an open standard for two-factor authentication based on public-key cryptography.

With your Yubikey, you must first register it into your account to authenticate later.

1. First, you must authenticate using another method, like your email and password.
2. When you plug in your Yubikey and signal that you want to register a security key, the server you want to authenticate with sends a challenge and an AppID to the Yubikey.
3. When the Yubikey receives this information, you'll be prompted by the browser to tap the Yubikey to confirm the request.
4. Your Yubikey will generate a nonce and hash it together with the AppID and the secret key to create a private and public key.
5. The nonce and public key are sent back to the server to be stored so they can be used later when the user wants to authenticate.

## Authenticating with your Yubikey

1. The server remembers you had registered a Yubikey, so it generates a new challenge to send back along with the AppID and nonce created when you first registered your Yubikey.
2. The browser prompts you to tap the Yubikey, and the Yubikey will use the information received in step 1 to re-create the same key pair created when you registered your Yubikey.
3. If everything goes well, your Yubikey encrypts the challenge sent by the server with the private key and sends the challenge back.
4. The server decrypts the challenge using the public key it already has, and if the challenge matches the one the server sent, it means the user authentication was successful.

One of the advantages of using a Yubikey is that they protect against phishing attacks. Registering a new key to a server sends an AppID that could be the website URL you're trying to authenticate. Therefore, the credentials you create in a server are linked directly to a single website.

Yubikeys provide one-touch login without requiring a mobile phone to complete an authentication challenge.

*Example, let's set up a YubiKey to work with Facebook. Note that for Facebook, the YubiKey can only log you in if you're using the latest version of Chrome or Opera. The hardware keys will work with Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge on some services, but other services are more fickle—check the browser requirements for each of your most commonly used web services. For the ones that don't support your hardware key, you can use a 2FA code-generator app instead.*

*On the* *YubiKey setup page*\*, click on Facebook. Yubico will send you to a Facebook page called ""**What is a security key and how does it work?**"". To set up your YubiKey, Facebook directs you to\* *Security and Login Settings*\*. Since a YubiKey is one of the factors in a two-factor authentication process, if you don’t have 2FA set up yet, Facebook will guide you through setting that up first. This usually involves providing Facebook with a phone number to text you a one-time passcode. Once that’s set up, go back to the\* *Security and Login Settings page* *and look underneath where it says ""Setting up extra security."" Next to the menu item ""Use two-factor authentication,"" click Edit. Under ""Security Keys,"" you’ll find the option called ""Add Key.""*

*Now the moment of truth: the actual inserting of the key. Place your YubiKey into your USB port. Once plugged in, the key should show you a blinking light. If it’s not blinking, try plugging it into a different USB port, or flip it around—you may have inserted it upside-down. Once you see the blinking light, press the gold disk in the middle of the key. (If your model has a button, press the button instead.) With that, your hardware two-factor authentication key is activated. The next time you try to log in to Facebook, instead of using a six-digit passcode to verify your identity, you’ll be asked to insert your YubiKey and give it a touch.*

*If you ever forget your YubiKey at home, don't stress it. Facebook (or whatever service) will merely ask you to use another form of 2FA to log in, so you can go back to using your code-generating app as a fallback. If you ever lose your YubiKey entirely, you can go into your service's settings and remove your old YubiKey from your list of security keys.*

**What is Bisq?**

Bisq is a peer-to-peer trading network, not a website or ""app"" or other centralized service. It's software you run on your own hardware, which connects to other people running the Bisq software to facilitate trades. It's open-source and community-driven.

And you can trade bitcoin for fiat currencies with it!

The difference between Bisq and other so-called decentralized exchanges is as stark as the difference between owning your own home and renting someone else's—in the former case you have full control over the property, and in the latter you're always subject to the landlord's whims and demands (no matter how nice the landlord may seem to be).

With Bisq you're always the owner—not just owner of your bitcoin, but also owner of your data.

* Bisq does not hold any bitcoin. All bitcoin used for trading is held in **2-of-2 multisignature addresses** controlled solely by the trading peers themselves.
* Bisq does not hold any national currency. National currency is transferred directly from one trader to the other using traditional banking and payment services.
* All Bisq data is transferred over its own secure peer-to-peer network, which is built on top of the Tor network—no central servers. This means **there are no data honeypots**, rendering large-scale hacks of customer information databases impossible.
* Bisq does not know anything about traders who use its network, and no data is stored on who trades with whom.
* Bisq does not require registration, so your privacy is protected, and you can **begin trading instantly**.
* Bisq is code, not a company. It is an open-source project organized as a [decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)](https://bisq.wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) built on top of Bitcoin.

&#x200B;

**What are we looking for?**

We are looking for people to volunteer for completing trades in the markets that need it DEXs the most such as high inflation countries (Like Turkey and Lebanon), countries with a lot of currency exchange regulations (such as Venezuela and Argentina), and untapped markets where P2P is being led by Centralized institutions, like the case of Binance in Latin America.

Here's a link to our [wiki](https://bisq.wiki/Main_Page) in case you have any question of how it works, what to do, how to do it.

And here's a link to our [Matrix Chat](https://bisq.chat/) in case you would like to contact us directly, we will be happy to provide you with the help you need to open a trade in your local currency, or you could also contact me directly.

Crypto is still a baby, in the process of defining itself as an asset.  It looked like the verdict was in with the high correlation with the nasdaq, but this is different.

The estimated amount of cryptocurrency purchases in gaming industry right now is anticipated to boom at least 10 or 12 times in a decade. P2E(play to earn) was and I still think is expected to crush the traditional centralized gaming market too. *Its still relatively hard to make an assumption about how much of the money going into the skin trades and whatnot is cryptocurrency so I couldnt find a reliable gross estimate to the market.*

13/3/23,"Simon Dixon advocated to convert Celsius estate funds to BTC, now theyre stuck at Signature Bank","I know this probably isnt that big of a deal considering that the Fed has made it very clear that deposits will be returned to customers, but i thought this was a little bit humorous from a security perspective.

Ive followed the Celsius bankruptcy from the beginning (unfortunately because ive had to) and there was a point that Simon and creditors suggested converting customer money into bitcoin, which sounded crazy but there was alot of upside to be had and even if there was a dip customers could still receive their claims in crypto.

This idea was shot down by the judge saying that “crypto is incredibly volatile” and didnt trust the safety of such an idea with cash being much more accessible. Cue the irony as Celsius has now disclosed it held a portion of its assets at Signature Bank, which is now closed for business. They will be made whole, but are now navigating an already bleeding Chapter 11 less liquid than before. Comedy.

Crypto may be only thing that will make difference between being either economical slave or free person for most of us here.","Everything is getting worse since 1980's. Once upon a time you could have home, two cars, wife and 3 kids thanks to  one salary, not anymore. Today  many people barely are able to pay rent. And it won't be better, probably it will be much worse.

You should probably reread Year 1984 and rewatch  all those dystopian cyberpunk movies, cause that's exactly what will happen in during our lifetime. Maybe not on that scale yet, but definitely differences between rich and poor will only grow, middle class will dissapear and you either will be in top 2% maybe 3% of society, or barely surviving, starving, thirsty rest  of people.


Fossil fuels are close to and end, climate gets worse, we have less water, overpopulation, CBDCs, we are controlled everywhere, growing obesity,  inflation biggest in decades and US government print dollars like they would be toilet paper.  We had covid and war in ukraine that shown us how fast everything can went to shit. And it will be much more in next 20 years. People will lose jobs cause of AI, robots and chatbots, prices  of everything will skyrocket. Some foods will become luxury, like clothes or electronics. Average person will be nothing more than mindless, powerless slave of banks, governments and corporations working for inhumane salary. You will either be rich or live on scraps. Whole world will turn into third world.


Thankfully we are in crypto, we see those changes and we may be able to become part of top few % of society not bottom of it like most other people. It is about survival and comfortable life. I would even compare it to getting back to medieval states ( clergy, nobility, merchants and peasants). It will become harder and harder to get out of poverty and averageness in upcoming years, maybe even law will forbit it. We already see school system and many tax laws are based on keeping average person poor. Differences  education, living standard and right will become bigger and bigger.


Will be able to stop this? I would love to sell yes, but let's be realistic, better be prepared for the worst with crypto than get hit one day when it will be to late. Crypto today is for us about our economical freedom or buying a home / car one day. In 20 years our crypto may be only thing that will make difference between life and death. People in Syria, Venezuela, Afganistan or Ukraine already experienced that.  Most of us will unfortunately have to make simmilar choices on day, even without war happening. World (banks amd governments) prove  you don't need war inside country to destroy economy and make people starve on the streets."

13/3/23,"Follow-up - 6 Months after Cardano's Vasil update, TPS has increased 40%","[**Cardano's Vasil update**](https://emurgo.io/cardanos-major-network-update-what-is-the-vasil-hard-fork) brought along multiple improvements including:

* **CIP 31, 32, 33**: Which combined with allows scripts to use reference inputs so that you don't have to resubmit a smart contract every time you want to use it.
* **Diffusion Pipelining**: Which allowed for blocks to be submitted without full validation in 5s vs 20s normally, allowing for multiple blocks to propagate in parallel.

The Vasil upgrade took place around Epoch 365-366, and as more dApps started supporting reference scripts with Plutus v2, Cardano's throughput rose.

## Cardano Block TPS

Max TPS is calculated as:

    (transactions per block) * (block / 20 seconds) * (88 kBs max size / block size)

I'm happy to announce that 6 months after Cardano's Vasil update, you can see noticeable results on [cexplorer.io](https://cexplorer.io/tps):

**TPS has increased 40% from 5 TPS to a WHOPPING 7 TPS**.

Congratulations Cardano. You have done it!

We are proud of this underdog.

&#x200B;

[You can see a huge decrease around Epochs 310-320 when smart contracts were introduced](https://preview.redd.it/s8zb88yf5jna1.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=933ac3bb6fb757107567ae85804510d32fa0e8b0)

But seriously, it is a lot better than the embarrassingly-low 1-2 TPS they were seeing at the start of 2022 when swaps congested the network.

**So why is Cardano so slow even after Vasil?**

1. Cardano has always been slow. This is a noticeable improvement.
2. Not every contract has switched to Plutus v2, and non-contract transactions do not benefit from reference scripts.
3. [Blocks](https://cexplorer.io/block) are still being produced at an average of one per 20s, even with Diffusion Pipelining. That's because Block production is inconsistent with large gaps. This is partially because there are too few transactions on Cardano to need it.

## Issues with using TPS as a measurement

You might point out that TPS is a misleading metric due to larger transactions completely skewing the average, and you'd be mostly right. But we can still do fair comparisons.

It's not just an issue with Cardano, but with most blockchains. If everything were single-transfer transactions:

* Bitcoin's TPS would increase 4x from \~3-4 TPS to 12 TPS (for a Segwit P2WPKH Tx with a change output)
* Ethereum's would increase 5x from \~12 TPS to 59 TPS

So we can still do equivalent comparisons. On Cardano:

* **Single transfers** (1 input, 2 outputs): 0.250kb or **18 max TPS** (vs 59 TPS for Ethereum)
* **Swaps** (\~7 UTXOs across 2 separate transactions): 0.95 kBs or **5 TPS** (vs 9 TPS for Ethereum based on 120k gas)

To be fair, you can add additional Cardano native tokens to a transaction while barely decreasing TPS. But this is only useful for CEXs and DEXs that do large batch transactions. Normal users would not send different tokens in the same transaction.

And at some point, Cardano will introduce sharding with its Hydra update. But I wouldn't get your hopes up too much."
13/3/23,A Reminder... None of us Know Anything!,"Sooo guess the saying that none of us know shit about fuck is more accurate than any of us know because what the heck is going on!?! 

Who else was shitting bricks over the weekend thinking today was going to be a bloodbath!?! I know I was. Most veryone in this sub and ""experts"" were all telling us to buckle up for what was about to happen. I didn't know if I should sell and convert to Tether for stability but seeing as how USDC was supposed to be the ""safe"" option, I didn't. 

Thankfully I actually made a smart move for once and consolidated everything I own to Bitcoin as I thought that would be the least volatile... Good thing for that. 

Today against all odds BTC is up 19.5% today. Apparently banks collapsing is a catalyst for a lot of people that they can longer be trusted, especially if this whole collapse can bowl down to Signature Bank trying to capture a few extra % on returns.

Additionally, NFTBOOKS guarantees authors perpetual royalties on subsequent sales and borrowings. While the borrowing function guarantees readers cheaper books.

13/3/23,Cryptos Place in the Current Chaos,"Okay if you had bank runs on your bingo card for the year congrats to you because that was not something that I saw coming. That being said here we are and more importantly how is the industry going to handle this turn of events? Looking through Silicon Valley Bank and who is disrupted by what has gone on interestingly a majority of the companies that held money there appear to fall into the biotech realm or other cutting-edge sciences. 

&#x200B;

It seems that Circle, the issuer of USDC, was the one major player in the crypto space that held a ton of money there to the tune of $3.3 billion. Now if it had been normal rules/operations Circle would only roughly get back $250,000 of this since that is where the standard insurance stops and according to Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), most of their deposits were not insured past this point. For once though the Government and Fed seem to be thinking about what is best for everyone and have made it to where the money in the accounts will be accessible. 

&#x200B;

This has resulted in USDC being able to almost completely regain in peg since the money will be there for Circle. That is not to say that Circle is in the clear as they will have access to this money but I am not sure where exactly they will be putting it. One of the Four Big Banks like JP Morgan could make huge inroads in the industry if they work with Circle and take on this cash. 

&#x200B;

From the  2007-2008 banking crisis, Bitcoin emerged and has since changed all of our lives on this sub in one way or another. Since all the major banks that have interacted with crypto have now gone down it leads me to wonder what the industry will come up with to address this issue. At the end of the day, onboarding and offboarding funds are going to be critical things to figure out and while banks would have been an easy solution to this we are now seeing that that could be an issue moving forward. Central exchanges have also come under increased heat recently with Kracken receiving a fine a couple of weeks ago and now KuCoin under fire by the State of New York.

They had millions in profits exposed many unfamiliar people to NFTs and created plenty of confusion about what crypto and NFTs can be good for on the way to their imminent demise.  

The core of their trouble is the usual issue where people fall into thinking there is a market for things they would not buy themselves (e.g., NFT shoes).  

As we wait for the world to melt down from banking news, I thought a separate conversation about how this could have been done better/differently would help.  Crypto to promote health is still a good fundamental idea.  If you know of good projects still holding it together in this space please let us know.

I think many people have flawed conception of 'adoption'. Sadly, I don't think that crypto can replace fiat, at least not in our lifetime, similarly how electronic payments did not really replace cash transactions. I do think that these need to work hand-in-hand so that there is no prejudice towards the 'more knowledgable' in crypto.

For example, I don't think my computer free grandma would ever understand the concept of crypto, let alone use it. On the other hand, my girlfriend's grandma asked us to invest in it on her behalf, without any push from us (It really came out of the blue). However, I wanted to set her up with a wallet, but eventually we went with the CEX route, just because the entry is much simpler.

But it's not only about the elderly or the very young. My brother refuses the concept completely. My cousin can't speak English and localized cryptocurrencies aren't really a thing yet.

How do you understand adoption? What do you think are the biggest barriers? How would you teach your relatives to switch to crypto (Provided there's essential infrastructure)?"

Today, moons performed beyond expectations and brought an adrenaline rush again and again. When I woke up, it was trading at 25 cents. Right now, it’s valued at 27 cents. 

But why the rise? If you are baffled about its meteoric rise, the following developments may bring you up to speed:
- CCIP-051 pays extra moons to those who provide Moons/ETH liquidity on SushiSwap. Seems like many people are keen to benefit from the liquidity pool when the APR is still high
- [Banner advertising](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/banner_records/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) is a win-win situation as it not only draws attention to the advertisers, but also allows moons to be burned, which enhances the Moon ratio. Seems like there is a queue of advertisers who has already committed to renting the banner space.
- u/TheHawk2319 announced his intention to launch a project on Arbitrum Nova that allow people to pay in moons. He’s tight-lipped about the details but left a hint: “memeable”.

There were many speculations, like people saying “this is the first indicator to a decentralized economy”. I even saw that CZ blamed the government on targeting the banks. This statement is of course in huge interest to CZ. If the government was really targeting the banks, Binance would make huge profits. 
All this dynamic and tweets brought me to a realization.

Away from speculation, let’s face reality amid this beautiful Bitcoin jump.
Fact is, if the government did or did not purposely set up the bank failures, at the end of the day the banks still fucked up and The crypto market STILL pumped. 

This is a message and it holds information. The market only reacts to information. Today it told us that the general public is able to put itself in a position where it would consider crypto as an alternative to the current financial system. Otherwise the crypto market wouldn’t have pumped to the news of such a banking disaster, especially not THAT fast!

JPEGs also helps pump your crypto bags. It’s also a way to keep people in crypto and involved in web3. I think non fungible tokens play a big factor in transactions of your fav coins.

Some people might even comment and say that’s not what this coin is meant for. Well neither is all the other bs stuff people buy with their fiat, like shit coins. 

TLDR; The thing is. Grow up. Jpegs bring more people to the crypto space. There’s money to be made with many many things in this world and Jpegs just happen to be one of them."

13/3/23,With the potential failure of multiple regional banks across the US - How quickly do we expect the Treasury to use this as their moment to roll out the digital dollar?,"It seems to me this is all very purposeful by our government to continue down the path of resetting our monetary system and choking off crypto in one fell swoop. 2020 they print 1/3 of all cash supply in a single year and push cash to everyone. Banks get more deposits than they ever have in a single year and take that money and invest it into what has always been considered safe… treasury bonds.

 Then the FED begins to raise rates at a precipitous pace in a manner no one could’ve predicted which puts major pressure on the value of those bonds purchases by banks. 

THEN, those same banks are forced to sell at a loss in order to provide liquidity for their depositors at which point small business and large account holders make a run on the bank for fear of not being able to get their money out. The government swoops in, shuts down the banks, and assures the depositors they’ll be made whole but now the fear contagion is spreading and more banks look likely to go under.

 Can they guarantee the depositors of every bank across the country? I read something like 10-12 trillion in cash is stored at banks across our country. So what happens next? It seems to me this is the perfect storm for them to come up with a scenario in which they finally issue out the “digital dollar” and begin our transition off of USD. 

Makes me wonder how they will choose to allow crypto to co-exist as this transition begins to take place or if they’ll see it as a threat to the system and want to devalue its place in the world of money."

13/3/23,"Banks are bringing systemic risks to crypto, says Circle’s Disparte",
13/3/23,"To not be victim of failures of centralized bodies in Crypto, learn self-custody even if it feels uncomfortable in the beginning.","Most people start in Crypto with opening an account on one of the centralized exchanges (CEXs) and buying some coin with $100/$500/$1000. As new knowledge comes in from Reddit announcements, Tweets or shady YouTubers - they keep adding to their portfolio. Sometimes they FOMO into a new shit-coin or sometimes they take premature profit on a good coin. Every once in a while, there is a good trade (bought too low, sold very high) and that makes them crypto maximalists. Well, I digress. Let's come to the point.

Before I get to the point, please note there wasn't a catastrophic big failure in Crypto for a while since Mt. Gox until Terra debacle happened followed by mind-blowing failure of FTX and a series of major failures in 2022 (""Yield farming"" players). Of course, not counting millions of shady or even good projects failing every day, they don't matter in the grand scheme. 

So the point is, beyond the protocol and security risks, the asset management is a huge risk as well. It's clear now that nobody is too big to fail and in that environment, it's extremely important to learn how to manage your own assets and take control of it. For those who start in Crypto with opening an account on a centralized exchange, self-custody a big discomforting hurdle to cross. It takes some level of believing to add a web browser extension icon to your browser, set the seed phrase and put all your ""money"" in that piece of Software. The same applies to hardware wallets. Doing these things for the first few times is non-trivial and often discomforting, but, an important necessity in today's time. It's the best way you can be sure (well, most sure) to save your digital assets and not be victim of a failure of a centralized exchange or any centralized player in crypto. As they say, your keys, your money!

So learn self-custody, plenty of YouTube videos and online content are available. You will thank yourself in the long run for building that muscle. It's also fun. You can also go on Solana (or other cheap blockchains) and play with various protocols - transaction fees is too cheap to worry :)

This is of course a non-financial (operational) advice to those who live in the comfort zone of CEXs."

As a small team of developers, we've been hammering on this for a while now and we’re finally getting close to a full release. Starting today, we have officially launched live trading on our algorithmic trading platform in early access.

The application has been running in Open Beta for the last 4 months, but only in paper trading mode. We spent the last few months making sure that live trading works as it should. If everything goes according to plan during this early access prior, we're looking at a full release on April 17.

We named the application AESIR because we all appreciate Norse mythology and wanted to incorporate some of it into our application. We started working on AESIR in March 2021 and we wanted to build a tool that’s easy to user and to understand, but that also allows users to create complex trading strategies.

**How to Algo Trading Platforms Work?**

In order to understand why a tool like AESIR can help a trader find and execute better strategies, it’s good to have a top level understanding of how they work. Algo Trading Platforms work by allowing the user to create a series of rules, that the platform is going to evaluate and execute. For instance, these rules can be as simple as a weekly DCA:

 `Buy BTC, ETH, DOT and SOL EVERY 1 Week, With an Order Amount of 100 USDT`

The algorithm will then take these parameters and execute trading according to it. This is just a minimal example, you can create strategies that contain complex logic based on Volatility, Technical Indicators and other market tools —

Could also do something like this:

 `Buy ANY COIN on THIS EXCHANGE that GAINED more than 3% in the 2 MINUTES and the RSI is under 70`

This is where you start seeing how a trading algorithm can help over a manual trading strategy.

And this here is the leaderboard.

https://i.redd.it/9nwzmh519kna1.gif

That's it for now. Hope to be back on April 17 and announce that we've finally launched this thing! In the meantime, you can [join our subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/aesirofficial/) to find our more, or [create an account](https://app.aesircrypto.com/) and play around with AESIR in test mode.

An investment with a quick return and high profits.  Believing in this promise, at least 15 thousand people lost all the money they gave to a man who became known as the Sheik of Bitcoins.  According to the Federal Police, his company only served to disguise a financial pyramid scheme.  And also to afford a life of luxury: a mansion facing the sea, imported cars and even trips in a private plane.

 Police disclose 85 Bitcoin Sheik companies suspected of billionaire scams;  see names: (down 👇👇 down)

 Francisley Valdevino da Silva, 37, became known as the Sheik of Bitcoins because he offered high profits for anyone who invested in digital currencies in his companies.  But, according to the PF, the promise was just a lie to deceive people.

 “There is no record that amounts entered and trading, investment, cryptocurrency operations were carried out.  This reinforces evidence that confirms the practice of this fraud, that he did not invest the victims' money”, says police chief Filipe Hille Pace.

 Sheik of Bitcoins: who is suspected of leading billionaire fraud in Brazil and abroad

 The investigation began after the US Department of Homeland Security asked the Brazilian Federal Police about Francisley.  He is suspected of committing financial crimes on American soil and in countries in the Caribbean, Europe and Asia.  Since the beginning of this year, when investigations began, the PF discovered that Francisley also had victims in Brazil.  Last week, he was the target of an operation that carried out 20 search and seizure warrants at addresses linked to the Sheik of Bitcoins, in four states.

Sasha says she lost more than R$ 1.2 million

 On the list of people who claim to be victims are some celebrities, such as Xuxa Meneghel's daughter, Sasha, and her husband, singer João Figueiredo.  The couple filed a lawsuit against Francisley, claiming she lost more than £1.2 million.  For Sasha and João's lawyers, the investigator acted in bad faith.

 Conversations intercepted by the police show that Glaidson dos Santos intended to intimidate journalists and flee Brazil

 In last week's operation, federal police and Federal Revenue agents seized watches, jewelry, luxury cars and money in a mansion on the coast of Santa Catarina used by Francisley.  On the property, valued at BRL 63 million, wines costing more than BRL 5,000 a bottle were also seized.

 63 'gamer' chairs, 59 shoes, 85 wines, piano: see list of what PF seized in action against gang led by Sheik of Bitcoins

 The police say that Francisley moved, in Brazil alone, about R$ 4 billion, and more than R$ 300 million are retained on his platforms.  The businessman, who responds to the process in freedom, denies that he has carried out a coup.

 'Bitcoin Sheik' attributed scams to 'internal fraud' during live for customers

'Bitcoin Sheik' attributed scams to 'internal fraud' during live for customers

Francisley's operations resemble one of the biggest cryptocurrency scams ever recorded in Brazil.  The Fantástico showed, in August of last year, how Glaidson Acácio dos Santos, the Pharaoh of Bitcoins, acted.  The police discovered that he moved more than BRL 38 billion in financial pyramids using bitcoin, a digital currency.  He was arrested and denounced by the Public Ministry for money laundering, criminal association, ideological falsehood and use of false documents.

13/3/23,5 countries leading the blockchain adoption,"I won't spoil the list because I don't want people to comment without reading the article.

Talking about the Country that landed in 2nd place, we see that it's government is putting a tax on crypto, and it's a big one, so it will definitely not be in this list next year. This will put an end to the satus of crypto heaven, which makes me sad because I'm from the country

Other funny thing is that judging by this article and other news outlets, media judges a country on how well it's adapted to crypto by how much restriction/taxation there is. So an tax heaven country will always be high on the list, which in my opinion is wrong.

Interesting article nonetheless, talks about a lot of countries"

Three of the very few banks that help institutional companies into and out of crypto positions failed this weekend. FedNow (what is likely going to be the US Govt's new stable coin) is about to launch in the next 3 months.  Circle (USDC stablecoin), a likely direct competitor to FedNow, was depegged from the US dollar due to liquidity issues from have a large amount of reserves in SVB. While it's back to being pegged to the dollar, it certainly allows the government to point to the volatility of that stable coin as a reason for not allowing it and point all users to its FedNow system. This coupled with all the recent cross hairs on stablecoins from the SEC, can't help but think this move is to crush liquidity in the crypto development space as well as position FedNow as the centralized stablecoin as they roll out CBDCs."

You guys @ the shiba army have been clamoring for this forever and now that it has come live you guys aren't there yet. Just like you clamored for a swap the devs gave you the Shibaswap and you guys barely touched it complaining about fees. The the Shiboshis NFT came out and you guys again balked. Then the sale of plots for the Shib metavrse and same story.  So Shibarium has been talked and hyped up forever. It is here. Hey anon at the Shib Army. Are you participating?

I have to admit the site is pretty cool. If you hold Shib on any Ethereum wallet you are eligible to participate. Once in you can get some goerli eth via any faucet (once every 24 hrs). Then via the platform you can earn 10 Bones via the provided faucet on site (once every 24 hrs) so you can delegate to any of the validators helping this come true. This is where you are needed. I know for most of you this is only about number go up not about an eco system growing and becoming a legit respectable project.

Well, Shibarum is right about the corner. Like it or not Shiba Inu has delivered more in time than most project could veer hope for with a massive amount of followers so let's see how this pans out when this Layer 2 finally rolls out live in Alpha. One thing I did miss was the road map about it having ZK capabilities in the future but I assume this is the plan long term and to ultimately dispose of admin private keys and make this truly decentralized.

I get many of you didn't want Shibarium to stay on Ethereum and wanted to become its own block chain. Well guess what. You were wrong. Shiba Inu starting a layer 2 on Ethereum is is by far the smartest move the devs have made to date. It has save the doggy coin. The puppy is growing and it looks like it is here to stay.

So there it is. SHibarium Beta is live on goerli test net. Go check it out. Its pretty cool and will only get beteer. Its been live a day or two. What are you waiting for? Go support you favorite doggy project."

13/3/23,This is why I am now all in on bitcoin.,"Imagine starting a round of bank bail outs while inflation is still higher than the fed funds rate.

Over the next few months as contagion in the banking sector spreads and stocks start making new lows the fed will have no choice but to cut rates with inflation still well above the fed funds rate. 

This is going to be an inflationary recession with banks going under left and right. You cant keep interest rates at zero for a decade then raise them at the fastest pace on record and expect nothing bad to happen. Rates were kept lower for longer than they were prior to the 2008 crisis and raised faster than they were in 2006/2007 meaning this is going to be a far bigger problem than 2008.

We are about to experience a chaotic financial crisis that grips the entire world before inflation can be contained, and the response of bail outs and QE will end up causing runaway inflation.

Bitcoin was invented for two reasons, to protect against inflation and to protect against a repeat of 2008, well now we have both simultaneously.

I am all in."

If you manage to acquire a good understanding of key management, which you should care about acquiring, then you can boot Tails OS on a USB, run [electrum offline](https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coldstorage.html) and use a watch only wallet to broadcast transactions from an online device. It's essentially a cold wallet at zero cost but requires some technical knowledge.

Your cold wallet is your savings account. You can top up a hot wallet/lightning spending wallet (your checking account) as and when you need.

A lot of people who are new to bitcoin think taking self custody is complicated but it's not. Backing up 12 words (and maybe a passphrase for plausible deniability) should not be complicated for anyone who passed primary school. It's never been easier for us to truly ""own"" anything without counterparty risk. 

Adding a strong passphrase to your seed words is like a dual key setup if there's no single point of failure for your seed and pass phrase and they're stored separately. You could also consider steganography.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sbogb8bl7jna1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f71558accd6e8bceb6819777ac4749b82cf40ae1

**What is Bisq?**

Bisq is a peer-to-peer trading network, not a website or ""app"" or other centralized service. It's software you run on your own hardware, which connects to other people running the Bisq software to facilitate trades. It's open-source and community-driven.

And you can trade bitcoin for fiat currencies with it!

The difference between Bisq and other so-called decentralized exchanges is as stark as the difference between owning your own home and renting someone else's—in the former case you have full control over the property, and in the latter you're always subject to the landlord's whims and demands (no matter how nice the landlord may seem to be).

With Bisq you're always the owner—not just owner of your bitcoin, but also owner of your data.

* Bisq does not hold any bitcoin. All bitcoin used for trading is held in **2-of-2 multisignature addresses** controlled solely by the trading peers themselves.
* Bisq does not hold any national currency. National currency is transferred directly from one trader to the other using traditional banking and payment services.
* All Bisq data is transferred over its own secure peer-to-peer network, which is built on top of the Tor network—no central servers. This means **there are no data honeypots**, rendering large-scale hacks of customer information databases impossible.
* Bisq does not know anything about traders who use its network, and no data is stored on who trades with whom.
* Bisq does not require registration, so your privacy is protected, and you can **begin trading instantly**.
* Bisq is code, not a company. It is an open-source project organized as a [decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)](https://bisq.wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) built on top of Bitcoin.

&#x200B;

**What are we looking for?**

We are looking for people to volunteer for completing trades in the markets that need it DEXs the most such as high inflation countries (Like Turkey and Lebanon), countries with a lot of currency exchange regulations (such as Venezuela and Argentina), and untapped markets where P2P is being led by Centralized institutions, like the case of Binance in Latin America.

&#x200B;

Here's a link to our [wiki](https://bisq.wiki/Main_Page) in case you have any question of how it works, what to do, how to do it.

And here's a link to our [Matrix Chat](https://bisq.chat/) in case you would like to contact us directly, we will be happy to provide you with the help you need to open a trade in your local currency, or you could also contact me directly.

13/3/23,Circulating amount of BTC vs how much is owned,"Past few weeks I've been thinking about the finite circulation of BTC, the famous 21 million, and how relatively easy it seems to be to purchase 1 whole coin at any minute. I personally know people who hold 0.5 to 1 whole coin and we know there are whales with thousands of BTCs. But how much are these on individual wallets confirmed and how much BTW is ""owned"" by people who have their coins on an exchange? 

My thinking is that there might be a very different amount of BTCs owned by people who actually just have some numbers listed under their Coinbase, Binance, whatnot wallets and what is the actual amount of BTC in circulation. 

I don't know if this has been discussed before or if it is known already but for example, for the speed in which BTC is traded globally on thousands of platforms, there has to be technological shortcuts taken when it comes to trading coins internally in an exchange. For example, exchange might have 2000 BTC in their wallet but they can schematically let people exchange 20 000 BTC worth on their platform since they trust not even 2000 would be withdrawn in BTC at once.  

I haven't yet tried to research this more but.. this is just a hunch. That the ""crypto bubble"" isn't limited to the FIAT value of BTC but the actual amount of BTC which has been such a holy thing and a strong speaking point to support its integrity. 

And if not. At least this'd make a good conspiracy theory."

13/3/23,In a world where Bitcoin is the currency. How do companies hide how much Coins they have?,"Not being a skeptic or anything. Just want to learn. 

Can companies hide how much capital they have from their competitors? Is that even needed. 

Just curious. Thanks in advance."
13/3/23,How immutable is the Bitcoin blockchain history?,"Our network is way too secure, and it is very hard to tell if it is even possible to attack the network with a 51% attack, with there being made zero attempts to double spend since its inception, unless we count hard forks.

We often tout the longest chain to be the real bitcoin, but one of the fundamental principles of bitcoin is that confirmed blocks should be set in stone and transactions be immutable.

That means if someone made a concentrated effort to make a reorg attack and they were successful in turning their reorg into the longest chain, accepting that chain as real would go against the core fundamentals of bitcoin.

Demanding that the longest chain is real is not reasonable at all. Would it not be obvious to other nodes that you are working against the interest of the network if you propagate competing blocks way later than what is a reasonable time for you to notice the new block and start mining on this one?

Should there be introduced a further discouragement to attempt reorg attacks?

Would it be possible for nodes to signal a competing chain is lagging too much behind the newest block, and mark them as a potential 51% attack?

Bitcoin might feel perfect today, but I think taking precautions to protect against future adversity would be diligent, even if it might be unnecessary."
13/3/23,Best Bitcoin payment card and setup?,"I'm looking to use Bitcoin for both personal and business use. I am considering trying to use Bitcoin for making my normal purchases instead of using traditional bank accounts - I suppose you could say I'm quite pessimistic about the future of the economy.

What are your thoughts on using Bitcoin payment cards? What do you all use and recommend?

I have been using Coinbase and Binance (US), and I just installed Electrum. I'm not a complete newb, but I'm not super knowledgeable or experienced with this either.

**Edit:** I just found this article -  [Signature Bank is closed by regulators, the third US bank failure in a week (msn.com)](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/signature-bank-is-closed-by-regulators-the-third-us-bank-failure-in-a-week/ar-AA18xoL9) \- Signature Bank was one of the banks that supported US and Bitcoin exchanging. This quote from the article, ""With both crypto banks gone, it may be harder to get back into dollars,"" is concerning. 

Any work arounds in the event it becomes too difficult or impossible to exchange Bitcoin for USD and vice versa? What impact will this have on payment cards?"

13/3/23,"Bitcoin a Store of Value, but are Stable Coins the holdup?","Form its inception many in our community have argued that Bitcoin would be a ""Store of Value"" and an ""Inflationary Hedge"".

However, with the current state of the Economy (take your pick), this has yet to prove true.  I have been trying to mull over why this has been the case.  One theory that I keep returning to is; 

**What effects have Stable Coins had on Bitcoin,  and what would things be like if they no longer existed?**

I was not actively into BTC during the ""really early days"" of its inception, I can remember back to a day when only 1 Stable Coin existed... Tether.  I can remember tracking how many new Tethers were being created daily and then hourly.  In those days many in my immediate circle saw Tether as a complete scam.  The idea that a company could just create this ""shit token"" that was a digital dollar and use it to buy up BTC.  Then later as the years passed and we entered the next 4 year bear cycle I can remember us debating about when we would finally see news break that Tether was infact a huge embezzlement scheme.

Fast forward to March of 2023.  There are currently more then 200 different stable coins.  The top 5 have a Market Cap of over 100 Billion dollars combined.  Tether being at #1 with a Market Cap of just over 73 Billion.

However, as I am writing this post, in the last week we have seen 3 crypto friendly banks now fail due to poor investment strategies (not crypto).  We have been witness to yet another “stable coin” de-peg from the dollar (USDC), and countless other issues in the last few months alone, that frankly we are all tired of hearing about..

To the point:

So this has me wondering are Fiat Based Stable Coins the reason Bitcoin has been underperforming as a true store of value and the inflation hedge we as a community believe it to be?

If we were to hypothetically imagine a world without Tether, USDC and other Stables;  How much of that +100 Billion in Market Cap would instead be in BTC?  

Would BTC then essentially become the dominant Hedge?

What would it’s valuation be then?!

In my humble opinion all Stable Coins have done is erode away the very reason BTC exists.  By recreating centralized based digital fiat currencies we have essentially created a “Hedge” that works against BTC.  These “Stable” coins take Marketcap away from BTC and may even be the very reason why it’s price action is still so volatile.  This Volatility is why BTC is viewed as a “risk on asset” instead of a stable store of value.

But alas I am just a lonely pleb.  What do I know."

13/3/23,How blockchain-based assets are improving the transparency and accessibility of real estate investments,"With the advent of blockchain technology, real estate investments are becoming more accessible and transparent than ever before. Real estate platforms integrating blockchain technology offer a new level of security and transparency, enabling users to participate in the real estate market without traditional barriers to entry. 

I believe that blockchain-based assets are improving the accessibility and transparency of real estate investments. Are here are some platforms that exemplify just this:

Firstly, blockchain-based platforms use distributed ledgers in order to create tamper-proof and transparent records of real estate transactions. This makes it easier to track details like ownership, transfers and other details, improving transparency. For example, **Propy** is a blockchain-based platform which enables users to purchase real estate assets globally using cryptocurrency. They use smart contracts to automate the transaction process, reducing the need for intermediaries and making the process more transparent.

Secondly, blockchain-based platforms are improving accessibility of real estate investments by lowering the barriers to entry. Traditional real estate investments most often require large sums of money to invest which make it difficult for everyday or small investors to participate. However, blockchain based platforms are changing this by introducing fractional ownership of real estate assets wherein investors can buy and sell fractional ownership of properties. For example, **RealT** is a blockchain-based platform that enables fractional ownership of rental properties in the United States, making real estate investments accessible to a wider audience.  
**Landshare** is another platform that is working towards bringing bringing real estate to the blockchain. They allow users to invest in tokenized real estate assets for as little as $50 and benefit from property appreciation and monthly rental income. 

As blockchain-based real estate platforms continue to grow and evolve, we can expect to see more investors participating in the real estate market and more opportunities for everyone to benefit.

13/3/23,The Banking Crisis Is Not Crypto’s Fault,
13/3/23,Several large transactions worth over $350 million were spotted on the ETH network,"You've probably noticed that Crypto whales were on the move over the weekend as several large transactions worth over $350 million were spotted on the ETH network.  


I read about it and find out that the first one was seen by blockchain-tracking service Whale Alert, a deep-pocketed Ethereum holder who moved 120,874 ETH worth over $177.17 million from an unknown wallet to another unknown wallet.  


Another Ethereum whale relocated 96,638 ETH worth over $141.81 million between two unidentified wallets about 45 minutes later.  


A mere moments later, a third whale sent 26,636 ETH worth more than $39 million to crypto exchange Coinbase, where the crypto could potentially be sold on the open market.  


Whale Alert also spotted a number of big altcoin transactions over the weekend, including the transfer of crypto assets to borrowing and lending protocol Aave and stablecoin-focused project Frax.  


After all of this going on I must definitely check my portfolio manager on Flynt Finance.

13/3/23,Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade list of EIPs and short summaries!,"LESS than a month until the SHANGHAI UPGRADE!  
  
In case you weren't aware, below are the list of changes included in the Shanghai Upgrade:  
  
EIP-3651: Warm COINBASE, reduce gas fees on COINBASE. Previously, Accessing COINBASE is overpriced because the address is initially cold under the access list framework introduced in EIP-2929. So, the first time we access accounts, it will cost 2600 gas, and for account storage, it will cost 2100 gas. However, if the state already accessed is now ""warm"", it can be reaccessed cheaply, i.e., around 100 gas. This will save around 2500 gas in case of account access.  
  
EIP-3855: PUSH0 instruction. Introduce a new instruction PUSH0, that pushes zero when called in the contract code. Right now, it is achieved by different means, costing additional gas and deployment time.  
  
EIP-3860: Limit and meter initcode. Will limit the max size of initcode to 49152. This will ensure fair gas calculation of initcode and simplify EVM engines to minimize failure risks.  
  
EIP-4895: Beacon Chain push withdrawals as operations. The most impactful EIP that was approved for the Shanghai hard fork  
  
EIP-6049: Deprecate SELFDESTRUCT. Meta EIP that doesn't require a node client upgrade. This EIP will deprecate the SELFDESTRUCT opcode by giving developers a warning. Later, EIP-4758 will completely deactivate it in the next Cancun hard fork.  
  
Key Takeaways:  
  
\- The Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade is a hard fork scheduled to occur in March 2023.  
  
\- Stakers and validators will be able to withdraw staked ETH from the Beacon Chain.  
  
\- Approximately 16 million staked ETH will be available for withdrawal.  
  
\- In addition to EIP-4895, there are several other EIPs in the Shanghai fork, most of which aim to lower gas costs for Ethereum developers.  
  
\- The withdrawal of staked ETH has been successfully simulated on the Zhejiang testnet."

1. Posting About Other Coins
2. Posting About Other Chains

I get the above two reasons for post removal but guess the posts that have been removed.

1.  **Voyager: US government appeals approval of Voyager sale to Binance. US** | Reason: Mentioning Another chain
2.  **Vitalik Buterin 'Endorsed' NFT Collection Pumps on OpenSea** | Reason: Mentioning Another Chain | Vitalik Buterin is another chain guy?
3.  **Bitcoin Proponents Slam Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman After Venmo Payment Issue** | Reason: Another Coin | This I understand

So, what constitutes an acceptable post over here? Please help me out. I am keen to be active here but don't know how to.

I have some questions, couldn't find answer in search bar, so I decided to make this post,

&#x200B;

Few years ago I opted to receive Donuts on XDAI, and I still use that wallet, how to opt it back to ETH and what is procedure for gas fees? I don't have much DONUTs, maybe 15$ worth of, but since I hold them, I would like to have them on ETH mainnet, so I need some guide, because like I said, I couldnt find any.

Also, I see there is Donut count next to a name, how does that work? Are those on ETH mainnet?

&#x200B;

13/3/23,"Coinbase took nearly $2,000 to convert 22 staked eth (cbETH) into BTC?","So this happened last night, customer support was basically worthless, so I'm coming here hoping that maybe what happened is normal.   


It's pretty simple to layout:  


The prices as of this trade last night were - cbETH/ETH2: $1,611 & BTC: $22,250   


\- sold 22.22 ETH2 for 21.59 cbETH (haircut of 3% - fair enough)

\- converted 21.59 cbETH (worth $34,781) into 1.48 BTC (worth $32,930) using convert

\- immediately sent all the BTC off the exchange which was the whole point

It wasn't until I was inputting the trades into my finances excel sheet that I noticed the discrepancy.  


Additional notes: I signed up for coinbase one free trial to make this trade to get 10k USD worth of no fee trading. Perhaps the fee for the remaining $24,781 might account for part of the nearly $2,000 missing dollars (1% of $24,781 would be $247)? Perhaps the $34,781 market sell on cbETH which has a low daily volume of only $7M/day caused me to eat through too many buy orders (supposedly convert has no market orderbook because coinbase settles it themselves)?  


Any insights on things I may be missing would be greatly appreciated."
13/3/23,Have there been any updates on when staked Ethereum will be unlocked?,"It's a rather long story, but I basically don't really trust Coinbase anymore and plan to move my holdings to an external wallet. Unfortunately I have ETH2 staked and it's locked, and I don't want to exchange it for cbETH and trigger taxable events and risk losing anything in the process.

Have there been any updates on when it will be unlocked for transfers? I remember when I first staked my ETH on Coinbase, they had claimed it would only be locked until the merger, so I'm really confused why/how they are still continuing to lock it all up now that the merger is completed."

13/3/23,Identity Management in Blockchain Technology,"Identity management is a complex process involving the identification, authentication, and authorization of individuals to access systems, networks, and applications. Fraud, identity theft, and data breaches are less likely to happen when strong digital identity solutions are in place. Some notable examples of blockchain identity management products are:

Ore Network (ORE ID) is a cross-chain open source identity and account protocol. Users will easily be able to control their identity, assets, and rights across various on-chain and off-chain applications with a single universal account. The pioneer product, ORE ID, is a single sign-on identification platform that works cross-chain.  With ORE ID, users of your web or mobile app can easily create an on-chain account upon first sign-in. Their private key is encrypted with a PIN of their choosing and stored for them, so your users never have to remember their blockchain accounts or keys.  ORE ID removes the friction between your app and your future users.

Nexera ID is a digital wallet designed to securely store your digital assets and identity. Set up rules for actions in the wallet, as well as for recovery. Multi-factor security and zero-knowledge proofs protect your wallet and your privacy. The versatility of the Identity products brings the best of Web2 and Web3 all in one platform. Nexera ID is also multi-factor secured, Verifiable credentials act both as your identity and your social security, with your information never stored anywhere.

VerusID is the first decentralized and self-sovereign identity of its kind. A VerusID is a friendly name blockchain address that can hold and stake funds. It is future proof and packed with advanced capabilities. In the permissionless Verus protocol, anyone can create a VerusID.

Layer One X- is not really an identity management system, but it allows an individual to interact between different blockchains built on two different consensus mechanisms with two different standards through the L1X system, dApps can also build on the L1X chain and leverage its features. The L1X chain provides all four important features of blockchain tech which are interoperability, decentralization, scalability, and security. The system also has a single identity recognized by any chain, meaning you can hold tokens, NFTs, and any tokenized data in one wallet, and any chain interoperable with L1X will recognize your identity.

Blockchain-based identity management solutions are gaining popularity as they offer more secure and reliable alternatives to traditional identity management methods. Ore Network, Nexera ID, VerusID, and Layer One X are some notable examples of blockchain-based identity management products that provide advanced and secure identity solutions. As the industry continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see what other innovations emerge.
