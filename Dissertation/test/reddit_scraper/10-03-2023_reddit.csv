As prices begun to fall this morning many who believed the market could only go up from here are coming to the hard realization that we seem to be in some sort of global recession.

Mike (a self proclaimed crypto bro):

>I didn't know the whole economy thing was doing really bad. I bough bitcoin and it's been going up and everything looked green but now it started falling and I had already taken out all these loans which I have to pay interest on and I'm not sure what to do. I tried taking my lime green Lambo back to the dealership but they wont take it, they kept saying something about personal responsibility whatever that means.

&#x200B;

Wendy's on of the most popular places for these crypto bros to work at has also announced that they are hiring capacity, no more jobs for crypto bros.

Luckily for Mike and others like him McDonald's has announced that they are willing to help.

McDonald's corporate:

>We will hire anybody as long as you are willing to work for minimum wage with no overtime and no complaining or looking at charts.

9/3/23,"Trading is very hard, most traders lose money and even a hamster can outperform most professional traders. Don't do it unless you are 100% sure what you are doing.","Trading is incredibly hard, yes you can use TA etc. but at the end of the day you'll need a lot of luck to perform very well in day trading. There was a Hamster couple of years ago who outperformed professional traders I kid you not. Here's a snippet from a BBC article:

""Mr Goxx, the crypto-trading hamster beating human investors.

Like many people, Mr Goxx is dabbling in cryptocurrency, hoping to strike it rich.

**He's notable for two reasons: first, he is making money, with his lifetime career performance up about 20% - beating many professional traders and funds.**

Second, Mr Goxx is a hamster.

The business-minded rodent has a trading office attached to his regular cage. Every day, when he enters the office, a live stream starts on Twitch, and **his Twitter account** lets followers know: Mr Goxx has started a trading session. By running in his ""intention wheel"", he selects which cryptocurrency he'd like to trade, as the wheel spins through the different options. His office floor has two tunnels nearby: one for buy, one for sell.

Every time he runs through a tunnel, the electronics wired to his office complete a trade according to Mr Goxx's desires.""

9/3/23,"DON'T USE Binance Visa's card, they don't protect you.","I've learned the hard way, so I'm reporting here so that you can't make the same mistake.

I've been using credit cards like forever. In the past September I made a purchase in a German Marketplace for a professional equipment (valued a little over 1000€), like I've done many times in the past.

The marketplace has a seller/buyers protection just like ebay or Paypal. Since this was 2nd hand professional equipment I was speaking with the seller about it, and we also spoke about other stuff in normal conversation, everything looked good.

I decided to purchase the item from him, but he managed to forge a link into the paying system that looked exactly the same as the system the marketplace uses.

So as you expect, I paid, he received the money, and after than he disappeared, never replied anymore, obviously sent no item, no tracking number, no nothing. 20-30min after I made the purchase, I receive an email from the marketplace, informing me that the person I was dealing has been blocked for the said practices.

So there you have it, I was scammed for phishing I guess... Thankfully I paid using Visa that has mechanisms to protect the buyer, and surely, they will reverse or chargeback this payment.

So right after I detected the fraud (only like 30min after the payment was made), I contacted Binance support... Good luck with that... they only replied next day lol.

Anyway, I explained the situation, sent all the proofs of conversation, payment, and email I got from the marketplace, I have every proof of the purchase, and obviously the seller completely disappeared, so they have nothing from their end.

They said they were going to check it out for me... Hey made me fill a bunch of forms (made on google docs) that looked pretty amateur, and told me to way 28 days....

I waited 28 days, then they ask me to wait another 4 or 5 weeks.

By December I call them back to give me updates, and they simply ask me what happened, and made me tell all the story again, give all the evidence, etc etc... So in the 3 months they did absolutely nothing, to the point that asking me the same things they asked in the day I was scammed.

All the forms, all the documents, everything was just for show, to make you feel that they were doing something. They did not...

I've complained quite a bit, and they passed me to a ""supervisor"", who knows, by now everything seems fake for me, just fake strategy to make you feel they are doing something.

Today is March and I had enough, they say they can't do much, and that I have to talk to authorities and the marketplace, when it's clear on VISA's own website that it's supposed to offer protection to online e-commerce  
[https://www.visa.co.uk/pay-with-visa/protection-benefits.html](https://www.visa.co.uk/pay-with-visa/protection-benefits.html)

There you go, don't use your Binance's card for online shopping as they don't honour the protections they claim.

Today I'm working with my lawyer to go against Binance.

**TLDR. Used Binance's card to buy a product in e-commerce, got scammed with proof, and Binance didn't do anything to offer protection (that all visa's are supposed to have) and looks like they were doing some fake stuff behind the scenes to make it look like they were doing something for me.**"

9/3/23,Today I've received my BAT rewards and I'm amazed.,"Not many hours ago I was here in this sub behaving like a full crypto Karen bashing BAT and Brave for the ridiculous rewards I got the previous months. As I commented in a post yesterday, I was lucky if I received more than 0.5 BAT after a month of hours and hours browsing and surfing on Brave. 


Brave is my main browser and I can easily say I use it for at 4 - 6 hours a day because of work. My latest BAT rewards were exactly 0.3200002 BAT.


Then, an hour ago or so, Uphold sent me an email saying that my BAT rewards for the previous month had been credited. I opened the message and almost lost my breath. It stated the following:


*""You received 1.060000000000011136 BAT from Brave Software International.""*


I couldn't believe my eyes. I rushed to Uphold to check my balance and there is was. Is the tide finally turning? The good old days are coming back? BAT to the moon?



**TL;DR: Fortune favors the Brave, never give up your dreams, mind your words and lets goooooo.**"
9/3/23,Why i am investing on ADA in this bear market.,"I am fully aware that Cardano is one of the most divisive coins in this sub, and that this post will either be buried with dislikes or completely ignored but I think this post can show a different way of investing. Firstly, it is important to say that I only invest in the long term, I believe that the market is much more predictable when predicting a larger time frame.

My investment journey started in stocks in 2019 and my only pick was AMD, I went against trend of investing in ETF's, and thought it would be more efficient and would give more returns to identify a good company than playing safe with the boring SP500, with long-term-potential, luckily amd was one of those companies. 

Then I joined Crypto in 2021 I followed the same approach, which led me to invest most of my money in BTC and ETH, but as much as I think these currencies are excellent investments, I wanted to find my optimal investment, minimizing the risks to invest in altcoins and looking to outperform BTC/ETH i found ADA. This was the factors I looked for:

Leadership

There are no metrics to measure leadership, there are no statistics that say how good a leader is, and in the Crypto world where currencies are supposed to be decentralized there shouldn't even be a leader right?  After all, cryptocurrencies are not private companies managed by an individual or group so it shouldn't apply. But let me make a point, a leader is not an owner or a dictador, a leader is the one who inspires and sets the path, a leader doesn't even have to be popular, fair, or good, but he has to have the ability to influence, a good leader, even if he is not present, can guide us forward and we have no better example of this than Satoshi Nakamoto. 

Lisa Su was the main reason I invested in AMD and Charles Hoskinson is the reason I choose the Cardano network, I know what you're thinking, ""Charles is a charlatan, a prick, scummy..."" I heard this too a million times and I'm the first to admit that Charles is never going to be unanimous, he's always going to be a divisive figure, and the reason is that a lot of what Charles says is controversial, and that's not a bad thing, matters worth talking about will always offend or hurt someone, the truth can be hard and raw, and when the people who you bother the most are people with power, you can be sure you will be an enemy, and this is reflected in the media coverage, public opinion, and even here in this sub. 
This is why i did my due diligence, decided i needed more than a headline or quote to form my opinion of him, and to my astonishment i was amazed at his coherence, eloquence and competence not only technically but in dealing with difficult problems. But my objective here is not to say what you should think of it, but to emphasize the importance of listening and analyzing the leaders of the projects you like, because no project survives without strong leadership, think of Elon Musk, Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, have you seen the hate they carry, how divisive they are? But they still manage to create some of the most successful companies in the world, there is no reason to believe that Crypto is different, business is made of people and crypto is people.

Strategy

how many monopolies have failed due to poor planning? Or due to sudden growths that were not sustainable? Blockbuster, Nokia, Kodak and many other companies were not ready for a world in constant evolution, we have examples of more recent companies that are doing everything in their power to adapt to changes in the market that they failed to foresee, Zoom, Netflix, Gopro for example, grew abruptly during the pandemic only to be pulled back to reality. These are not the kind of companies you want to invest in for the long term, and again crypto is no different. Perhaps BTC does not need to adapt, but we have seen how difficult it has been for ETH to adapt to the chaotic world of cryptocurrencies, (I am not attacking Ethereum) as I even think that Ethereum is one of the few coins with a clear and well defined vision, but this is another point that made me choose Cardano, the Roadmap is clear and adjustable, there are 5 phases taking place simultaneously to create what I believe to be the objective of a layer 1 a decentralized, autonomous and sustainable blockchain. I have not found any project with such solid foundations and prepared to adapt to the market while prioritizing governance and the democratic process, not even Charles himself can decide anything by himself, of course if we look at metrics we see more developed projects, with better numbers, but the security of having solid fundamentals is something non-negotiable in my opinion, this are systems that will interact with entire financial markets, we need guarantees that the blockchain is not only prepared for anything but will not be corrupted or manipulated by people or groups bad intentions. 

X Factor

I know it's weird to talk about an x ​​factor in this context but think with me... why are people obsessed with Apple products? When you imagine an expensive watch, do you remember Rolex? When it comes to photo editing, do you remember Adobe photoshop? Probably yes. We human beings are emotional beings, and not recognizing this is just lack of rationality, if brands or even products can awaken feelings and sensations and this leads people to buy or use, how would this be different in Crypto? Many projects have unique characteristics, but few have the X factor. 
It is undeniable that BTC transmits security in the chaotic world that are alternative investments, the fact that we do not know who created Bitcoin was a great impetus to make BTC the people's currency , a symbol of resistance, the first crypto, the ""grandfather"" and depending on who you ask, a cult. This is the real reason why no coin is going to replace BTC, emotion. ETH has its X-factor, Vitalik and his vision, the first smart-contracts blockchain, it's hard to imagine a future where ETH is not here. This brings me to Cardano, where a strong community has come together with a focus on democracy and decentralization and freedom, even if it means falling behind AKA (turtle ap roach) how much will these foundations and Predictability be worth in the future? Cardano is often called a cult, and in part those who say it are not wrong, but devaluing the importance of community and sentiment is. 

These were the factors I used to invest in the markets and pick winning projects, both in stocks and crypto. I'm not saying to think like me, but to use critical thinking to identify the best investments, we often end up clinging to metrics that tell us little about the future, people control the market, numbers are just a reflection of that.

I know it was a long post, so thanks for reading until the end. Good investments."

9/3/23,"Friendly Reminder of The Math of Gains And Losses: After a 69%, You Would Need 222.58% Gain To Even","A lot of people doesn't know or forgets (I include myself) the importance of knowing about The Math of Gains And Loses.

We use to think that when an investment drops 50%, we would need just 50% up to get even but that is incorrect. We would need 100% gain to make even.

In this table you can see how much you would need to get even depending on the % loss:

|Initial balance|Percentage loss|Balance after loss|Need percentage gain to restore loss|Ending balance after gain|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|$1,000|\-5%|$950|5.26%|$1,000|
|$1,000|\-10%|$900|11.11%|$1,000|
|$1,000|\-15%|$850|17.65%|$1,000|
|$1,000|\-20%|$800|25.00%|$1,000|
|$1,000|\-25%|$750|33.33%|$1,000|
|$1,000|\-30%|$700|42.86%|$1,000|

You can easily calculate it with this formula:

    Needed % gain to restore loss = [1 / (1 - % Loss)] - 1

For example, the needed gain to restore a 10% loss can be expressed as:

     [1 / (1 - .10)] - 1 = .1111 or 11.11% 

I know that you are going to hate me for messing up the party but I had to bring some perspective to you.

I hope it helps you to have more perspective about gains and losses and see why it is important to DCA down or even sell projects that you don't have faith in.

Thanks for reading my post and I hope you learned something and enjoyed it.

See you!"
9/3/23,"Silvergate Bank is not a failure of crypto, it’s a classic run on the bank fuelled by short sellers and politicians pandering to their lobbyists. Sealed by a political decision to not bail out a crypto-friendly bank","Silvergate bank is winding up, and lots of people are calling it a failure of crypto and doing victory laps. Nothing could be further from the truth

The reason Silvergate bank failed was a duration mismatch between its assets and liabilities :- customers deposited money in Silvergate, which Silvergate then used to buy long dated treasuries and municipal bonds which have very low default risk but the bond price are sensitive to interest rates. Meanwhile, last year was one of the worst years on record for bonds, due to Fed rate hiking cycle. Coupled with implosion in crypto markets (Genesis, FTX etc) meant there were huge redemptions of USD at Silvergate. However, since the bonds have faced a big drawdown, they had to constantly sell their assets to fund withdrawals. Now we know that Silvergate had to realize over $700m in losses by selling their bond holdings to fund withdrawals 

Since FTX in November, Silvergate has been one of the most shorted stock - lots of prominent short sellers had made Silvergate their target. Politicians like Elizabeth Warren added fuel by singling out Silvergate. Warren aided short sellers by writing letters and putting political pressure on FDIC and FHLB to squeeze Silvergate out. All of this added more fuel to the bank run

There is nothing illegal in a federal chartered bank obtaining advances from other banking agencies to manage their liquidity situation. Yet these were used to put political pressure and create outrage (because crypto bad), and eventually shut down access to FHLB because other agencies don’t want to help out a bank if it looks like the government and government mouthpieces are against the idea. 

Given that all banks run fractional banking, no other bank would have been able to withstand a bank run. All banks run asset liability mismatch and if there are huge withdrawals, they would have to sell their bonds at marked down prices and book losses. However, they usually get bailed out by Fed and other agencies by offering them a liquidity supply line or advancing loans. In worst case scenario, the failing bank gets merged into a larger bank. [There have been more than 12 bank failures in the last 5 years](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/resolutions/bank-failures/failed-bank-list/) where the failing bank was merged into a larger bank. In Silvergate’s situation, they had borrowed liquidity from FHLB but this pipeline was shut down after political pressure was put on the agencies. In the end, FDIC arrived at the scene to seal the bank’s fate 


Tl Dr: this is just another episode in the ongoing unbank crypto operation, which is being dubbed as “Operation Chokepoint 2.0”. Silvergate could have easily been bailed out if Fed and the government deemed it necessary - like they bailed out dozens of other banks in the last decade or so. Post GFC 2008, they even bailed out corrupt banks after fraudulent actions by bank executives. The bailout at that time was magnitudes bigger than what Silvergate required. 
We will remember this the next time the financial system blows up and a corrupt bank has to get bailed out"

This is some kind of surprise considering the nature of the government (they like to have control of everything) but well, I suppose they had to be less ambitious and not take everything for them.

In this case, it is the tax on large financial transactions (IGTF) is a tax that you have to pay if you move money at it is set by 2% also if you pay in USD cash you have to add 3% more tax, if you pay or transfer crypto you avoid that 5%.

9/3/23,Anyone else super excited about the big drops?,"Quick preamble - I've been really busy at work the past couple days and haven't kept up with the charts like I normally would.

Through a combination of catching up today and CoinGecko notifications, I've now seen the huge drop in my portfolio and I could not be happier. Seriously. If anything I want to see it drop another 10-15%.

See for me I missed a serious opportunity just after Christmas. I had money from a birthday, the holidays and decent work bonus ready to invest and I held on for particular price points. I reckon I got within 5% of those, didn't buy like a fool then the January rally started. Proper toe punt to the plums.

I was grumpy for a spell but then latched on to the narrative that there's 'always' one last big drop before the bull starts and we hadn't had it yet. I started to believe and so I stopped my manual DCAs (I have auto ones too) through the rally period and built up a stack of fiat. Yes it may not ever have gone back down but that's the risk I took.

So where I'm at right now - I'm buzzing. I'll probably wait a little while longer to see how dippy the dip gets but I am going to town with this money I've saved. A combination of chunky BTC/ETH buys and averaging down a few key alts. It's going to be glorious.

Anyone else is a similar boat and lapping up the red like a hungry hungry crypto hippo?"

Wallets apps are just Blockchain Viewers/Interactors that with your seed phrase opens a window to look/interact into/with the blockchain and see/move cryptocurrencies related to that wallet in the Blockchain. This is why it is so important to know that you only need to protect your seed phrase.

If whatever wallet you use is deleted, you just need to find another wallet app that supports the blockchain networks of your cryptos and reload your seed phrase to be able to see and operate with them. There is no need to feel tied to a wallet app.

I hope you learned something new or remember how crypto works in the end."
9/3/23,Top 1%?,"So I’ve often seen articles about what it takes to be in the top 1% for bitcoin. According to several searches, that amount is around 0.28 bitcoin, although it’s impossible to actually pinpoint. That said, does anyone know what the approximate threshold is to enter the top 1% is for other coins or projects? Would love to hear what it takes to be in the top 1% for some of the other popular alts. 

Might be easier to target top 1% levels for smaller coins or projects. Could also provide motivation for those who are still stacking in the crypto winter.

Cheers!"
9/3/23,I'm bullish for all risk on assets including crypto. Here's why.,"Originally wrote this as a comment but thought it would make a good r/cc post on its own.

 I've been in the financial markets since 2007. When they bottomed in 2009 I thought no way is this the bottom. Everyone was talking about a double dip recession. Economic numbers were at their worst. How could this be the bottom? That's when I learned that financial markets for risk on assets tend to bottom when things are at their worst BUT the rate at which things are getting bad is slowing.

I think that's where we are now.

Everyone is expecting a recession. Markets don't price in what is happening right now if it's known ahead of time. Markets price in what is known when it's known, not when it happens.

https://www.conference-board.org/research/economy-strategy-finance-charts/CoW-Recession-Probability

Right now the expectation is for a recession, if a recession doesn't happen that's what will be the surprise. Markets aren't going to be caught off guard by a recession.

Core CPI is ugly. But the rate at which it's increasing has been decreasing for the last 4 months.

If we look at fed funds futures we can see the market is currently expecting further rate hikes the rest of that year. But the rate at which interest rates are expected to rise are also slowing down. Markets are pricing in modest rate hikes, not the jumbo ones we saw last year.

War has already broken out in Europe but now global markets have become pretty accustomed to the war. As long as the war stays contained with direct conflict between Russia and Ukraine it is hard for me too see it having too much impact for global risk on assets. Now if another country were to get involved with direct fighting then I think all bets are off. But right now a war in Europe is the status quo.

US dollar index is high but until the US dollar isn't the world's reserve currency and US treasuries aren't where the world goes when they are risk averse this is always going to be the case that the dollar is high when there's global economic uncertainty. We'll also see USD generally rise when the Fed is hiking interest rates and fall when the fed is loosening. Since the Fed is expected to raise interest rates over the next year I would expect the dollar to rise with it. I don't see a reason why it would correlate with risk on assets.

tldr: In summary I'm bullish. Why? Peak global uncertainty is behind us and we may not have seen the worst but we're now at the point where things getting worse is not as bad each time a new number comes out. We're near the top of the 'bad' curve. We might not be at the point yet where it has turned over but that upwards curve is flattening. It's here when historically markets tend to bottom. If new events occur that make either one of these statements not true I might turn bearish but right now I'm seeing what makes me bullish."
9/3/23,"""Do you accept crypto?""","The growth of crypto takes an effort from the crypto community? How can you help? Start asking about it in everyday activities. When you buy a coffee...ask ""Do you accept crypto?"" When you go to the grocery store...ask ""Do you accept crypto?"" When you go to a restaurant...ask ""Do you accept crypto?""

What exactly does this achieve? First, you might get the opportunity to actually use crypto! (Exciting, right!?) Ignore the people that say you should never use crypto, help support the ecosystem and just refill what you spent. 

Worst case scenario is they say, ""No, we don't"". It still plants a seed in their head that crypto is becoming normalized. Maybe that worker will go do a bit of research into crypto after and buy a small stack. Maybe that business owner does some research on how to accept it in the future.

Gemini is collapsing before our eyes. JPMorgan is axing crypto exchanges like they’re going out of fashion. 

And today, Silvergate Bank, a Californian company that mainly dealt with crypto, has announced its shutting down operations. 

Of course, this is all happening in the midst of a bear market. But even still, the sentiment isn’t good. 

We could very easily see Bitcoin sub $15k and Eth $1k again.

9/3/23,Have you earned money using Technical Analysis?,"I've seen some videos that teach technical analysis, there are obviously thousands of courses and books out there about this. Basically many patters are drawn on the charts, it feels like people make up lines and triangles to predict where the price will bounce and how the market will behave. From a sensible perspective, that does not make sense at all, does it?

People always say that no one can time the market. However, there are many people still believing that with a couple of lines and patterns you can make tons of money as a side hustle. In conclusion, this feels like astrology; very unrelated events used to predict a future no one else can.

What has changed since you have been in the crypto space and what value do these changes add to your life? 

This doesn’t necessarily need to be about financials. 

Example:

Maybe learning about blockchain technology allowed you to get a job in a different field and this allows you to spend more time with your family?

9/3/23,Dogecoin founder has Declined Elon Musk’s offer to build Twitter 2.0,"Elon Musk's recent announcement about a decentralized social media platform based on blockchain technology, dubbed Twitter 2.0 has garnered mixed reactions. 

The funny thing is that Billy Markus, one of the co-founders of Dogecoin, has declined Musk's offer to collaborate on the project.

Markus, who has been critical of Musk's influence on DOGE's price volatility, tweeted that he was not interested in working with Musk or anyone else on the venture.

Even though people gave him a heck of a time for not joining Elons hand, he still decided that doge is better off elon. What shocked me the most was that he sold his entire bag back in 2015 by stating he was struggling financially.

No skin in the game no interest in the field I guess."
9/3/23,Coinbase has dropped direct deposit support for most credit unions.,"This leaves you with two options:

* Sign up for a big bank (or one of the few supported credit unions, but none in my city appear to be supported for example, and traveling to another town to deposit money is an inconvenience)

* Accept credit / debit card fees of 10% for small purchases (like buying $10 USDC to use with the Coinbase Card, which I used to do all the time) or ~4% for larger purchases.

Basically there are now very few fiat penalty-free onramps for Coinbase which don't require you to keep your fiat in a big bank. Bit contrary to the anti-big-bank crypto ethos, isn't it?

*EDIT*: Also wanted to add that it's not just Plaid (which posted ""[Now supporting Auth for every bank and credit union in the US](https://plaid.com/blog/new-auth/)"" in 2019). Coinbase's manual verification also failed with my credit union."

9/3/23,Crypto Taxes – FAQs 2023,"Gearing up for the 2023 US Tax Season? We've put together an FAQ list with answers to the top questions we've been receiving about crypto taxes - including FTX losses.  

## Crypto Taxes – FAQs

### Is crypto taxable?

Yes, purchasing crypto with fiat or holding crypto is not taxable, but selling, trading or spending your crypto is taxable, as well as any income earned from the crypto such as staking. If you are a US taxpayer, you should report your crypto gains, losses and income in your yearly tax return.

### I made money in crypto, do I have to pay crypto taxes?

Yes, every US taxpayer is required to pay taxes on any income or gains from the sale or exchange of cryptocurrency. While you may not receive a tax form from the exchanges, you should report all trades and income in your yearly tax return and pay any tax due by the applicable due dates.

### I lost money, should I file crypto taxes?

Yes, it is important to report any gains and losses from cryptocurrency transactions on your tax return. Even if you lost money and owe no tax, you should file as you can use these losses to offset other gains in the current or future years.

### I had funds in a bankrupt exchange, can I get tax relief? 

If you managed to sell or trade the coins, you must report any gain or loss no different than any other gains or losses from trading. If you still own the coins but are currently unable to access them due the bankruptcy proceedings, such as the case of FTX, you are [**not currently allowed**](https://news.bloombergtax.com/tax-insights-and-commentary/ftx-collapse-proves-the-playground-for-grownups-needs-rules) to write them off based on the current tax law. 

Furthermore, FTX customers with funds on the exchange have not lost all the funds, as they are considered creditors in the bankruptcy case. It is expected that customers will recover some amount, however, the amount of the recovery after other creditors are paid remains unknown. For this reason, taxpayers have not realized a total loss yet and the amount of the loss will remain unknown until the bankruptcy proceedings are finalized, which could take over a year.

9/3/23,New attack on poorly generated nonces shows wallets already drained by hackers,"One of the most important rules of crypto transactions that are based on the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (BTC, ETH, lots of others) is that the nonce, a one-time random value that is included in the calculation of the signature, must be kept secret and it must be randomly generated.  If you accidentally reuse the same nonce twice, you might as well have posted your private key to Twitter because it can be easily extracted by [combining the two signatures](https://ishaana.com/blog/nonce_reuse/).  It also happens if you use a predictable nonce, like a sequence of increasing numbers.

This has been known for a long time, but it conflicts with the popular intuition that people (and developers) have about nonces, which is that they normally have to be different but it isn't important that they be random or secret.

This brings us to the newest version of this attack, called [Polynonce](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/305.pdf), just released this week.  The authors were able to show that you can do this key recovery attack not just against nonces that are repeated, or follow a simple pattern, but any nonces that are polynomially related to each other!  This is a huge deal because one of the most common random number generators, if you aren't especially careful about the security of your code, is called a Linear Congruential Generator.  As the name suggests, the outputs are linearly related.

They tested their attack against the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains and found almost 1000 wallets that were vulnerable to private key recovery.  Fortunately, they were all actually the more dangerous and well-known form of nonce reuse, and not the new polynomially related nonces.  They discovered that all of these wallets were [already drained by hackers](https://research.kudelskisecurity.com/2023/03/06/polynonce-a-tale-of-a-novel-ecdsa-attack-and-bitcoin-tears/) and they did some interesting analysis of where the funds ended up.

The takeaway, for me, is that generally the wallet software people are using seems to be pretty good, but also that malicious hackers are pretty sophisticated in their methods to be able to take advantage of a relatively obscure attack.  Makes sense when there is potentially a lot of money at stake, but cool to see some analysis of things like this."

9/3/23,Does Ethereum have any serious competition? Is there a token/network that could replace Ethereum one day?,"Hi. I'm wondering if there is any serious competition to Ethereum, especially after Ethereum has upgraded to Ethereum 2.0 and proof of stake. From my understanding, Ethereum right now is the king of Dapps and has a nice, and growing ecosystem.  With proof of stake implemented last year, transactions are faster as well.  

I was reading some posts in Reddit from the Ethereum subreddits where the consensus is that it's very hard for the competition to push over Ethereum now.  But those are Ethereum subreddits so I think the comments are biased.

Does Ethereum have any serious competition? Or is the competition so far behind Ethereum, that it's unlikely that the competition will gain any real traction to replace Ethereum?"

I've gathered some data from Nasdaq and did some rookie charts for you fine folk.

# On that day, there were only 300 transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain

It is insane to think on how early those people were. **Yesterday's number of transaction was 975x higher**. If you look at the chart, it does put things in perspective:

Interesting to see that the number of unique addresses used correlates quite well with the number of transactions, at least visually.

# TL;DR

Check the title of each section.

With that being said I'm not sure where else would be a better place to ask this, so, what's stopping YOU from buying moons, are there any glaring problems or negatives you see on chain or feel that's stopping you?

9/3/23,$312M worth of Crypto assets were liquidated in the last 24 hours! Of which 93.6% being Longs worth $292M,"
The last hours we saw a huge drop in price with Bitcoin going from $22K to nearly $20K. This will ofcourse result in alot of liquidated Longs. 

**Here is a short summary of the past 24 hours:** 

• In the last 24 hours about $312M Dollars worth of assets were liquidated.

• The liquidated Shorts and Longs of being: $292M were Longs (93,6%) and $20M were Shorts (6,4%).

• About 101.540 traders were liquidated!

• Top 4 largest assets liquidated: 

$115M of BTC, $73M of ETH, $7M of LTC and $6M of SOL.

• The most unlucky whale that got liquidated has been liquidated on Bitmex with BTC-XBTUSD with a value of $9.49M Dollars. 

The liquidations will likely go higher with more volatility or a even larger drop. It is unknown if it will drop even further in this unstable market.

Personally I try will not come close to using leverages in this extremely volatile market. 

**Don't invest more than you can afford and be careful out there!**

9/3/23,How do you decide that your holding will beat the competitors?,"When you look at the posts on this sub about what people are holding, you see a lot of L1 projects. I won't give any examples but we know what they are. The last bull run had a lot of them pump. In 2017/2018 a lot of utility tokens were in fashion and this time it's L1 projects.

Now the holders of these tokens must have reasons for believing that their particular token will win out. They will win against the multitude of competitors and maybe even have a chance against Ethereum.

How did you decide that your chosen project will win? What made you take that risk?

For me there is only one metric and that is adoption. If they project is not getting big time adoption and is not working as it should be then forget it. Most of us here are not qualified to judge a project on technicals like the architecture of the software or the competence of its team. ""Partnerships"" are also irrelevant without real use. If Amazon, VW or whatever isn't actually using your project.

To buy into most L1s thinking they will win is a gamble. Buy them all or buy particular ones being sure that you know what you are doing.

Knowing Silvergate used to partner with nearly all of the major exchanges I decided to look for a connection, and found reports from January [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ArkhamIntel/status/1611273268010586112) that Huobi banked with Silvergate and might have had trouble accessing their reserves.

Around the same time Justin Sun founder of Tron - sent $100M in stablecoins from Binance to Huobi.

Then 13 days later Huobi announced that Justin Sun would be leading the exchange. [Source](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/01/19/huobi-confirming-justin-sun-as-leader-takes-aim-at-rat-trading/)

>“Under the leadership of Justin Sun, it can be said that Huobi has embarked on the path to rebirth,” the blog post said.

Could the complete failure of Silvergate reveal deeper damages at Huobi? That's not clear, but if you have crypto at Huobi you should be taking it off the exchange. The cratering token could signal much larger problems for the exchange that we're not yet aware of.

Edit: Seriously get your crypto off Huobi, It's could be very real that they are dumping their exchange token to cover user funds or trying to cash out. Alex Mashinsky dumped a ton of CEL prior to Celsius declaring bankruptcy.

Edit2: Justin Sun's Tron is now experiencing moves. Down 10% over the hour while the rest of the market is stable on the hour. The market is either anticipating something bad happening behind Justin Sun's ventures is responding to something bad happening."

Like everyone, I've made some dumb mistakes in this space. I made one recently and this drop has reminded me of the importance of patience in this game.

A couple of months ago I bought a fairly large (for me) bag of Matic. As luck would have it, I bought right before the little run it had the past few months. I almost immediately made 20%, decided it was a fluke and sold. The price then continued to climb, and I patiently waited for a dip. I waited and waited but the dip never came. Finally there was a small dip and I jumped back in. Here is where I made a big mistake.

As basic as it is, my strategy has always been too only by when the Bitcoin fear and greed index is at fear or extreme fear. The index was still at neutral but I felt like I had waited ages for a dip. So I bit the bullet and bought another bag. And of course, I'm down quite a bit now. Had I just waited, and stuck with my strategy, I'd be in a much better position right now. But I let FOMO get the best of me.

Moral of the story, crypto is wild... Months feel like years in this space. But you should NEVER chase pumps or FOMO in. If you stick to buying when there's blood in the streets, you'll likely come out the better side of things.

This is starting to look like the end.  Crypto’s reaction to Silvergate wasn’t nearly as volatile as Terra or FTX.   The asset class is settling in regards to industry-specific news.

The bigger impact this week was from J-Pows comments on higher terminal rates, showing how closely crypto is still correlated to equity markets.

We’re definitely moving into the period of regulation.  While bullshit and fucked up, its unfortunately necessary for widespread adoption.  Today 2-3% of the world and ~20% of the US have adopted crypto;  in order for this number to increase we need regulation.  We’re past the early adopters and now into the beginning of the bell curve.  

IMO, this is great for the next bullrun.  Recession conditions aside, if regulations are in place for the next bullrun, what does that mean?  Large bank adoption.   What does that mean?  Boomer money.  Institutional money.   It will most likely be the last crazy bullrun in crypto history.  And I can’t wait.

It’s ok to not have a huge bag of crypto (…yet). Just remember that you have more time. I’ve been seeing a lot of we are still early posts and it is *so* true. We are still *very* early. Some of the most life-changing cryptos probably haven’t even been invented yet. We are in the very beginnings of something that will be commonplace for our children and grandchildren. Its just amazing that you are here and get to be alive in a time where we get to witness the birth and development of such an amazing, profound technology. Sure, maybe we weren’t early enough to become millionaires by buying a few dollars worth of Bitcoin back in the day. But there will be other opportunities and just being in this space makes it more likely that you may eventually profit from one such opportunity. 

It's also awesome that you’re here in this sub. You are part of a community of people with one common interest, cryptocurrency and its many facets. That’s amazing. When I was young, communities like this just didn’t exist. If your friends or family didn’t like what you liked, you were often alone. I often felt like this growing up because I always liked things that not many others seemed to like. Now, I can talk and interact with people who all share the same interest as me, the potential of an amazing new technology. And you can too! Even if you don’t make a thousand Moons a month like others users do, you are still part of this (albeit sometimes dysfunctional) family. A family that can share knowledge and mistakes with each other, so all can learn. I just think this family needs to start being a little more positive and kinder with their upvotes. But nonetheless, we are a community of enthusiasts and what we are passionate about is and will change the lives of so many people and that is a glorious thing, so don’t forget it! Keep reading and learning, keep posting, you are part of some big!

Now for some advice. The easiest trap to fall into when someone gives you hope of a new opportunity to become rich is to FOMO into things without thinking. Remember to always do your homework about projects before you invest money into them. Don’t let the fear of missing out on an opportunity, make you jump into something blindly. And the most important rules: you need to prioritize and only invest what you can lose. When buying crypto, pretend you are buying something at a shop with a no return policy. That’s it, that money is gone. If you’re ok with that money being completely gone then ok, but if not, then you shouldn’t be investing, even if you truly believe ‘this is the one that’s gonna make me rich’. Make sure your priority is your IRL life and health. I myself have been guilty of over extending myself and I can say it is rarely worth it. You just need to make a sacrifice later, which will cause disappointment. Make sure you always put yourself first. Make sure you have enough for your essentials before you even start thinking about spending on crypto. 



Some other pieces advice for crypto beginners (and honestly, experts alike, but I’m guessing experts will find this obvious) that I have been able to gather and have made a difference to me are:

1) Don't try to time the market. It's very hard to predict when the best time to buy or sell crypto is because there are so many factors involved. So, just remember, [DCA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp) is the way! But don't feel bad if you need to take a month off. Like I said above, prioritize your life first and foremost. 

2) Don't panic sell. When prices drop sharply, many people tend to sell their coins at a loss, hoping to avoid further losses. This creates more downward pressure on the market and makes it harder for prices to recover. Instead of panic selling, try to stay calm and rational. Look at the bigger picture and the long-term potential of your investments. If you believe in the fundamentals of your coins, don't let short-term fluctuations scare you away. 

3) On the flip side, it’s ok to take profit from your gains. Opposite of what I said above, when prices rise rapidly, many people tend to cling to their coins indefinitely, hoping for even higher returns. This creates more upward pressure on the market and makes it more prone to corrections or crashes. Just take some profit when you reach your target price or when you see signs of overvaluation. Then, you can reinvest your profits into other coins or diversify into other assets. 

4) Remember that not every crypto influencer has your best interest at heart. I have seen whole posts about this and it is solid advice. Remember the ‘Appeal to Authority’ logical fallacy. Just because someone in a position of authority says something is true, does not automatically make it true. There are many people online who claim to be experts or advisors on crypto investing but may have ulterior motives such as pumping their own projects or getting paid by sponsors. Be careful who you trust and follow online. Always do your own due diligence before taking any action based on someone else's recommendation.

5) And of course, ‘not your keys, not your crypto’. Don’t trust anyone with your money. As we have seen many times before, these people don’t care about us, the little guy. So don’t let the likes of SBF play with your money and lose it. Get a hardware wallet and keep your crypto as safe as you can.



So, just remember that it is ok if you aren’t a crypto whale, fish are important to the ecosystem too! Being here, in this sub and this space is amazing in and of itself. Remember that you’re early, but always be cautious; don’t FOMO into projects and prioritize your actual life and well-being. And another important point to make, is to always enjoy yourself, even when the charts are showing nothing but red. We are seeing the evolution of an amazing technology. Enjoy learning, enjoy sharing, enjoy crypto and bring that enthusiasm to this sub. If you’re enthusiastic and keep learning and sharing…the moons will come. 

Thanks for reading! I hope I brought even a little hope to some of the people (like myself) that can’t/haven’t invested large amounts into crypto, or are just discovering this space. There is room for everyone to benefit from this technology if they do it wisely and responsibly. You don’t need to have a lot of money to be a part of the crypto revolution; you just need to be open-minded and optimistic about the future!"
9/3/23,How have your cryptocurrency experiences changed you as a person?,"While the ""this is a casino"" sentiment is still going strong, day by day the number of cryptocurrency users in the world increases, and I feel we're slowly seeing more and more investors alongside the gamblers. Maybe it's just a symptom of the current bear market?  

Cryptocurrency as a whole is in a unique place of it's life cycle right now. With Bitcoin having been around for over 10 years now (getting real close to 15) most people will have vastly different experiences and stories to share.

When did you first find out about cryptocurrency? When did you first purchase some, and how was the experience? 

Perhaps you were introduced with Dogecoin 10 years ago and are still trying to access the coins you have somewhere. Maybe you were a true crypto-OG but couldn't find the energy to restart after Mt Gox. You might have even struck gold and just hang around as you're not sure what to do with your newfound financial freedom.

I'm interested to hear everyone's stories, and see what things we can learn from others' successes and mistakes. What kind of highs and lows have you been through? Mistakes you've made? And how have these experiences changed your sentiments and behaviour over time? Not just in crypto but in your day to day life as well."
8/3/23,Most wouldn’t hold Bitcoin after it past $10,"There’s this rosy picture of Bitcoin and becoming a millionaire today if we had invested in it 10 years ago. 

The truth of the matter is, most of us (including myself) would not have held Bitcoin if it had hit $10. And for the most patient of us, maybe $100. 

You would have to be a lunatic to continue holding a coin that had 10x’ed or 100x’ed. 

Put it into perspective and imagine Cardano or Matic shot up to $5 and then $10 this year. How many of us would continue holding it? How many would sell it to recoup losses in the past year? Now imagine it just kept going up. It went to $50.. $75… hit $100? That would be life changing money for the few thousand dollar investments that you had. 

If you invested $10k in Cardano today and it shot up to $100, you’d have $2.85 million. No way in hell would a reasonable person continuing holding it for it to maybe go to $150? It’s more likely than not that it comes back down. 

Cardano is just an example, but pick your favorite coin. If it shot up 10x, most of us would sell. 

So it’s fun to imagine how we would hold Bitcoin for 10 years as it shot from sub $1 to $69k. But it’s not realistic. Only those who forgot their secret phrase, lost their hardware or forgot they ever purchased bitcoin would hold it as it went up 69,000%. 

We would more likely take out the money, like any sane person would do, and reinvest it elsewhere or go buy a nice house.

That’s just my two sats."

9/3/23,Crypto Wallets Are Not What You Think!,"Do you actually know how your crypto wallet works?

This is a quick guide on how crypto wallets work. If you’re new to the space, this can be very helpful as this information can be overwhelming.

There are lots of wallets that can be used, and this can often be confusing.

Some examples are:

**Litewallet, Electrum, Metamask or Ledger.**

All of these wallets have one thing in common. They are **not** actual wallets and they do not store your crypto.

Your “wallet” is just an application that allows you to interact with your crypto. Your crypto is stored on the blockchain, **not in your wallet!**

Its very important that you remember to **write down and store your seed phrase in a safe place**, where nobody can find it. If you lose access to your crypto wallet, **your crypto is not gone**. It’s very easy to recover as long as you have your seed phrase. You simply enter your seed phrase into another compatible wallet, and your crypto will be there!

**Warning!**

The same goes for somebody who finds your seed phrase. If they enter it into a wallet, they now have access to your crypto. **KEEP IT HIDDEN.**

There are multiple types of wallets out there and this can get confusing as well. Cold storage is considered the safest and is recommended for storing large amounts of crypto for long periods of time.

* **Exchange Wallet** \- This wallet belongs to the exchange and is technically a hot wallet. The crypto in this wallet belongs to the exchange. You do not have access to your private keys. It is very important to remove your crypto from the exchange wallet as soon as you buy it.
* **Hot Wallet** \- This wallet has internet connectivity and in theory is vulnerable to malware attacks.
* **Cold Wallet** \- This wallet is not connected to the internet and is very secure.
* **Hardware Wallet** \- A device that stores your seed phrases and are more secure than a hot wallet.
* **Paper Wallet** \- This is a physically printed QR coded wallet.
* **Desktop Wallet** \- These are software base wallets you can install on your computer. These are very safe, and often used as cold wallets after a clean install of the OS.
* **Mobile Wallet** \- These are smart phone apps. Not as secure as cold storage, and potentially vulnerable to malware attacks.
* **Web Wallet** \- These are browser based wallets that hold your private keys. These are also vulnerable to various attacks.

The wallet you decide to go with will be a personal decision and different for everybody based on their needs. The most important thing to remember is:

**NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR COINS!!**"
9/3/23,The Federal Reserve is launching a crypto-investigative taskforce.,
9/3/23,A Horse and Sushiswap... Who else remembers this crazy story from last year?,"Yesterday I was reminded of a wild time last year that some of us may have forgotten about or never heard of if you are new to this space. It has to do with Sushiswap and a horse.... 

A lot of us might use Sushiswap but lately has been getting momentum here for it's moon liquidity. Anyway, there was a comment that someone made that brought back memories from last year like a flood. Who here remembers the reaaon that the price tanked for Sushiswap last year? 

For those who dont know or remember, it has to do with the CEO Jared Grey... First reason the price tanked was it was believe that Grey was responsible for a heist of 70 percent of the funds from an earlier crypto project, ALQO. They say that in 2019, he covered this theft up by swapping the currency from one blockchain to another, then rebranding it under EONS. ALQO was accused of being a scam and if nothing else, it’s clear that the outcome of this crypto experiment led to some bitter grudges among those involved.   

Here's where the story took a **weird** twist.... 

Twitter user @jcryptooooo asked, “Is this the same dude that fingered a horse?” Crypto shitposters immediately took the story and ran with it, creating a parallel narrative that Grey had molested an animal. These rumors immediately caused the price to tank rapidly. In Twitter DMs with Rolling Stone, Grey vehemently denies the allegations of animal abuse. “Are you asking me if I ever had sex with a horse or violated one?” he says. “No, the answer is no. I think it was mostly a troll that somehow gained traction.” 

Rolling Stone reached @jcryptooooo for comment and confirmed that they had planned to sow chaos from the start. “I was just scrolling through Twitter doing my usual,” they say. “I’ve probably got a higher number of people that have me blocked than I do followers, as I like to call out a lot of the nonsense/bullshit posting I read on crypto Twitter.” He was inspired to revive an old gag. “Back when I was younger, me and some mates used to joke around when talking about people, ’Oh yeah, is that the same bloke that wanked off/fingered [insert animal]?’ they explain.

So long story short.... no he did not finger a horse but the internet didn't care. Internet once again proves that rumors spread faster than facts."
9/3/23,It feels like two different inputs keep on affecting me,"On the one hand today was a bad day for crypto. (FED, Silvergate…) And the markets dropped quite a lot. Now the first type of input I get is „It will reach a lower low!“

On the other hand I have some thoughts I'd like to share and I genuinly care about your reactions.


First, it is quite unrealistic to believe that the markets will drop when everyone believes it may drop. Otherwise the majority would always be correct when the market pumps/dips.

Second, Bitcoins halving is going to be in 2024 (somewhere between February and April if I remember correctly). And if we look in the past, Btc always pumped months before the halving. So why should it be different now.

Just trying to present a new perspective. No financial advice. 

Besides all that I keep on DCAing and invest every week.

Surely there is no certainty. Just had this thought. 

What do you guys believe will happen in the next 3-5 Months?"
9/3/23,"Touch Grass, Be respectful, Have Fun","I could not have imagined becoming a moderator and embedding myself deeply into a community. But I have. Nothing is more rewarding than keeping a community engaged and watching everyone enjoy themselves especially through a bear market. The following are three things I've learned.

# Touch Grass

It's easy to get so far down the rabbit hole of crypto that we get stuck there. All we can think about is what we do in the online world. We start becoming removed. So get out there and touch some grass. Go for a bike ride. Go to the gym. Walk your dog. Anything to get your mind off things.

This holds true both for mods and other community members. But especially for mods because we can often be the target of community members who become upset for one reason or another. Maybe close DMs from time to time?. Also, exercise helps alot. Stop being a couch potato 😂

# Be respectful

Sometimes people can be disrespectful especially when voicing their opinion. Keep in mind, no matter how good your points are, people won't listen to you if they don't like you. Be respectful.

# Have Fun

I had a lot of fun connecting with community members, sharing ideas, our favorite foods, favorite projects, and so much more. So just have fun.

What are some things you've learned?"
9/3/23,Crypto.com Struggles to Maintain Fiat On-Ramps in the Face of Crypto Banking Crisis,
9/3/23,"I have to make a post about how ridiculous it is to call Bitcoin a scam. It's almost an oxymoron, when there is so much corruption in the financial world, so many scams. But the one thing that's decentralized and works to remove that corruption, is what people want to call a scam.....","You can make the argument that maybe Bitcoin isn't for you, maybe it has its issues.

But at the end of the day, it's a tool. It's a decentralized ledger, that removes authority and control. You can participate in transactions on that ledger, or not.

It doesn't promise riches. It's just runs an algorithm. An algorithm that works on removing some of the key element commonly found in scams.

&#x200B;

First, where is the idea of Bitcoin being a scam usually coming from?

1- It's volatile.

When you see people get rich quickly, or quickly lose money. It does make it a bit scary. But an investment with a high volatility index doesn't mean it's a scam.

2- It sounds like pixie dust.

It's hard for people to think something is real when it's digital, or when they can't see it.

Much less when blockchain is not something simple to understand

3- It has no intrinsic value.

This I will address at the end. But something that sounds like it has no intrinsic value, doesn't draw much trust, and is vulnerable for a greater fool market. 

4- It's for hackers. 

A lot of people still think Bitcoin is something run by hackers, and hackers are gonna steal their money.

5- It has no use.

There are people who don't know what Bitcoin does. Aren't aware that many people and companies around the world are actually using and benefiting from its features. Much less understand  blockchain and what it provides, in terms of security, decentralization, efficiency, and switching the world from corruptible to trustless. 

6- I have to sell it for more money to someone else to make money.

That's pretty much how business and capitalism works.

If I buy a stock, I have to eventually find someone who is gonna pay me more than what I paid for, in order to make money. 

Especially as stock that pays little to no dividends. That's the only way I can make money.

Same with cryptos that pay little to no staking rewards. 

But the thing with crypto, is you still get value and benefit from the tech. There is an entire service you can enjoy with the blockchain. Providing you security and decentralization. Giving you full control and absolute ownership. And you can enjoy increasingly more features like smart contracts. 

&#x200B;

# The Ponzi scheme

People like to call Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme, but does it fit the definition in any way?

A Ponzi scheme is named after Charles Ponzi.

It's an investment run by a centralized entity that promises big returns (the investment doesn't even need to exist), but the person running the Ponzi is diverting new investor's money, and using it to distribute it to older investors, disguised as interest or returns.

Something that would be very hard to do with blockchain, because of the transparency of the chain.

If you want to see that Bitcoin isn't a Ponzi, all you have to do is look at a block explorer, and you'll see the proof is in the pudding. 

Nowhere in Bitcoin's white paper does it promise big returns. Much less is Bitcoin centralized with a Charles Ponzi running it. Much less is money taken from new wallets. 

I sold Bitcoin several times at a loss, I'm still waiting for my Ponzi paycheck for being one of the earlier investors and selling it to new people. 

At the end of the day, you can see it directly on block explorer, on-chain, and on exchanges, that when you buy Bitcoin, you buy it directly from a seller who's a trader like you. At the price you and the seller both want.

You are trading it in a traditional market, in the same way you trade stock. At the price you decide, and the price individuals in the market are willing to sell.

It's dictated by supply and demand. 

Same when you sell it, you sell it directly to individuals on the market, at the market price. And there's not a Ponzi payday you receive. 

# 

# The greater fool theory.

Typically, when people call Bitcoin a pyramid scheme or a Ponzi scheme, they are really talking about the greater fool theory. They just didn't know the difference.

This is a situation in trading, where an investment may be overvalued, not have the fundamentals anymore, not have justifiable intrinsic value, or become too speculative.

In that case, you buy it over-valued or purely out of speculation, hoping to sell it to a greater fool at a higher price.

It's a vague theory, but can be applied to Bitcoin if you don't think it has any value.

In any investment, or in capitalism in general, in most transaction there is always gonna be someone who doesn't see value. 

&#x200B;

# How does the greater fool theory apply to Bitcoin?

The implication here for Bitcoin, is that it has no value other than speculation.

Completely ignoring the side that offers a technological solution, providing utility, problem solving, and something that has intertwined value with other markets, where it's not only exchangeable for dollars, but it has exchangeable value in a wide variety of goods around the world, exchangeable value with properties, other currencies, and other cryptocurrencies.

But the greater fool theory for Bitcoin is coming more from the idea that Bitcoin has zero intrinsic value.

&#x200B;

# Does Bitcoin have no intrinsic value?

If technology provides a solution and solves a problem, it's hard not to have no intrinsic value.

It may be mainly digital, but doe software not have value? One of the ways we solve problems is with software. And what really has value in this world? Anything that solves problems. 

If Bitcoin was just like some monkey NFT, or some monopoly money, with no tech or services, it would have little to no value behind it.

But you do have a service. You do have blockchain, which is a network of computers around the world, providing a service to verify your transaction, and let you know how much funds you have, functioning like a bank. But more importantly, providing security, and providing you a decentralized service.

Do security services have not have any value? Does banking not have any value? Does a payment network like Visa not have any value?

If you think they don't, then Bitcoin will not have any value to you either. 

But there is more to Bitcoin's intrinsic value.

There's huge farms of machines behind it, and a whole world of mining that supports that system. A system that has an economy of its own. With costs to provide their service, and value that is intrinsically put in what they mine.

So before anyone enjoys any of the service and technology of Bitcoin, there is already an economy intertwined with the world economy, and intrinsic value already built in the foundation of mining the coin. 

The whole mining mechanism was actually a very clever system.

&#x200B;

# Conclusion

Ultimately, value and whether something is a scam or not, comes down to where the trust is

In every scam, there is either a company, government, individuals, who create a scheme where they take money from people subversively. By corrupting something. Something you have to place your trust in.

Where there is control and centralization, there is opportunity for corruption.

That's why all the scams in this space, from Bitconnect to FTX, involved centralization. 

That's why the financial system in general, has been so corrupted, and so full of scams.

Scams aren't a thing exclusive to crypto. It's even bigger in traditional finance. 

Bitcoin has been created as the tech solution to this corruption, removing the element of needing to have to trust someone. The key element in a scam is always having to put your trust in the wrong thing. In decentralized cryptos, that element is reduced, and in a strong decentralization it can be completely removed."

# JUNE 2, 2022: 6 MONTHS AFTER THE LCX EXCHANGE HACK

[LCX is a Swiss German Crypto Exchange that services high net worth accounts](https://preview.redd.it/rdiduqz4rpma1.png?width=827&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=526e0dea488dc0789074c3de2f4a4c91fc72f356)

LCX's attorneys acknowledged this latest court petition was a last-ditch effort. The public consider NFTs a scam. Why would a panel of judges think any different? It's 2022, and rulings still arrive via fax machine.

But they've exhausted every option. They're desperate to serve a hacker with a court order. It's the only way they can set their plan in motion. That's how the NFT idea emerged.

Line by line, the ruling read:

>*The courts cannot be blind to changes and advancements in technology. No longer do we live in a world where communications are conducted solely by mail carried by fast sailing clipper or steam ships. No longer must process be mailed to a defendant's door when he can receive a complete & legal notice at an electronic terminal inside his very office, even when that door be steel & bolted shut. The Court of the Southern District of New York rules in favor of the petitioner for use of a non-fungible service token to function as technology-assisted service of process.*

LCX's counsel, Holland & Knight, celebrated. Their blockchain investigator didn't. In his opinion, the plan had no chance of success. They would airdrop an NFT to John Doe's known wallet addresses. He then had to interact with the NFT in a certain manner. Failing any of that, this was a waste of time.

[First time an NFT used as to deliver a legally binding court order](https://preview.redd.it/k7pqxrbumoma1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e63e95e564973ecddb61268df9cf04c239b117ca)

**IT TAKES ONE TO KNOW ONE**

The attorneys preferred a personal approach. Their thesis was that the blockchain is big, but NFTs are small. If they draw him in, he may commit a mistake. By controlling the environment, they narrow the range of outcomes. It was their job to predict those possible outcomes, and devise a trap for each one.

Counsel believed their competitive advantage was an ability to think like scammers. Now they had a court order and a real shot at securing lost funds.

They took a few days to write the NFT.

This still begs the question: ***How does convincing a hacker into viewing an NFT recover any money?***

* US court order
* a duly recognized US authorized authority
* by majority vote of its Board of Managers

Basically, for any reason.

Back then, the sentiment is that we aren't early anymore in the cryptospace, although great gains should still be possible.

Almost 2 years have passed, the boring crabbing bear market takes its tolls.

Many people left the cryptospace and some who stayed try to encourage each other.

One of the ""encouragements"" is the slogan **We're still early**.

**Are we still early**

I think not.

**So are we late then**

No, not either!

**We're somewhere between**

So no more big gains??!

**No, quite the opposite! More and more adoption is coming, once mass adoption comes, anyone who still is on crypto can be happy and be rewarded for their endurance and patience**"

This legislation is expected to be proposed today 3/9/23.   The Biden Administration believes the change will generate $24 billion for the federal government.  

This legislation will still be a ways off from becoming a reality.  It will need to pass the House Of Representatives and then pass a Senate vote before being signed into law by the president.

8/3/23,What do you see happiif the US keeps escalating it's attack on crypto?,"So obviously nobody can shut down a network like Bitcoin. But it's clear the US sees crypto as a threat to me. The way they have been slowly ramping up their attacks.

Perfect example is how they don't call Bitcoin a security because they could never make that case but they are apparently going to try to make selling the equipment to mine Bitcoin a security. 

Obviously various other cryptos could be label a security and they could limit access to the US requiring a VPN to use their networks possibly. 

So while I'll definitely agree the US can't kill crypto, what I believe they can do and are trying to do is kill its price. If they kill its price they are basically limiting the people who will buy and use it to a small fraction of the population. 

I know there's tons of people here who are in it for the tech or Bitcoin maxies who think Bitcoin will replace fiat. But the truth is at this point the vast majority of people in the crypto space are simply looking at crypto as an investment to be later sold back to fiat hopefully at a gain. 

So if the US successfully dropped Bitcoin back to say $1k lots of investors would not be looking to invest for a long time this could really hurt adoption and possibly relegate crypto to a fringe investment. 

I believe the US is more than happy to leave it as a fringe investment as long as they don't see something like Bitcoin as a threat to the dollar.

**Grayscale**

What is it?

\-$14 billion in assets under management owned by Silvergate Bank

\-They basically sell Funds that invest in crypto and converts into a ETF(the reason for the lawsuit)

\-Shares of their GBTC trade at a 42% discount to actual BTC price, but if able to convert to a ETF would track the BTC price more closely, because right now you cant cash the shares for BTC.

&#x200B;

**The primary issue**

\-Lawsuit against SEC has been going on since June of 2022

\-they want to convert their largest bitcoin investment into an exchange traded fund(ETF)

\-They are challenging a previous SEC ruling

\-Seeking to differentiate between the spot market and futures market for bitcoin

\-The SEC claims that these funds can’t protect the public from fraud and manipulative acts and practices

\-The SEC’s view is that the market could be manipulated

\-SEC continues to site its mandate to protect investors in the U.S.

&#x200B;

**Side issues**

\-FTX is suing Grayscale because they feel if grayscale had reduced its fees its shares world be worth 90% more than current value. They claim they can unlock $9 billion or more for shareholders and a quarter billion for the company.

\-Other companies that have been rejected for the same issue Grayscale has: “Fidelity, SkyBridge Capital, and Valkyrie Investments Inc. More recently, in January 2023, the SEC denied a spot ETF application by Ark Invest and 21Shares”

\-Silvergate has decided to liquidate the bank and fully repay any deposits. They have discontinued the Silvergate Exchange

&#x200B;

Summary

\-We see a win for the SEC(more price tanking), or we get spot BTC ETF's(and the people rejoice)

&nbsp;

Now WoolyPooly has their defense which is basically that they distributed those amounts to the wrong wallet by mistake and are going to send it to the correct miners in the coming days/weeks/months.

Personally I'm not taking a definitive stance on either side as it requires a lot of investigation to sort out if they really have a legitimate excuse, but if you have mined with WoolyPooly in the past or are still currently mining with them you may want to check your records and make sure you are not owed anything."

8/3/23,"Bullish case for CBDCs, not what you think.","First and foremost, I firmly believe that BTC is here to stay no matter what happens. It is indestructible, immune to inflation, and will gradually gain widespread adoption over time. 

Now, onto the title. We are all aware that governments worldwide are experimenting with CBDCs, which may be disheartening for crypto enthusiasts like us. However, I see a silver lining in this in the long run. 

In my opinion, central banks are stuck between a rock and a hard place. If they do nothing in terms of digital currencies, they risk losing control. But if they create their own CBDCs, they hope to maintain control and continue to lead people like sheep. I foresee two potential scenarios that are likely to play out over time: 

1) Central banks continue printing fiat and do not create CBDCs, causing the population to gradually wake up to the devaluation of their currency and turn to crypto/BTC for a solution, leading to increased adoption. 

2) Central banks create CBDCs and force/give the option to use them over physical fiat, exposing more people to digital currencies and ultimately driving them to learn about the true value of decentralization and immutability of BTC, which will speed up adoption. We have seen this in Nigeria, where the government limited cash withdrawals to $40/day to encourage the use of the new eNaira, [but it backfired](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/03/06/nigerians-rejection-of-their-cbdc-is-a-cautionary-tale-for-other-countries/), causing people to turn to BTC and other cryptocurrencies, driving the price of BTC in Nigeria to over $38k (true price being only $23k). 

So, in either case, central banks will lose unless they shut down the internet, and if they shut down the internet then they lose control completely by waking everyone up instantaneously. The only way for them to manage this balance is by adopting crypto themselves and becoming leaders in innovation. Decentralized crypto adoption will continue to thrive! In any case, stay safe and keep accumulating."

&#x200B;

Recently, as covered by **penguinz0** latest video, Dr Disrespect's game called Dead Drop has made headlines as a focal point of the gameplay is a play to earn model. As a quick recap, the game will be a free to play extract-type first person shooter (similar to Escape from Tarkov). Basically, when you drop into the game you would find NFTs throughout the map and if you extract with those items you can then sell them on the blockchain.

Which brings us to why the entire core idea of  Dead Drop and every single play to earn model game for that matter has and will continue to have a glaring issue at least for the foreseeable future. As soon as a play to earn model is implemented in a game, it is very difficult to prevent a dedicated size of the player base to **cheat** and ultimately exploit every single nook and cranny of your videogame.

&#x200B;

If you're passionate about a project if you enjoy the gameplay, hey more power to you, but to ignore the reality of the situation especially to those who consider these types of projects an ""investment opportunity"" is truly a slippery slope.  No human could design an anti-cheat strong enough to combat the absurd lengths people will go to to cheat in play to earn games."

https://preview.redd.it/kxze7fuhvoma1.jpg?width=2268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=38a35924d3ce38c97efee49796c9d8b40801c102

No KYC, no identifying yourself, no obligations. You just send them digital assets, they give you cash. Also works for buying.

I understood that this is due to the government (and thus the banks in the country) not allowing transfers to foreign companies and this is how people got around it. Within the country, nobody cares or regulates these physical exchanges, nobody pays tax on crypto transactions, and it's all part of a beautiful peer-to-peer ecosystem, as initially intended.

After this experience, I started noticing that this is a trend everywhere throughout the city! Here is another one, in the city center:

All jokes aside, I really loved the concept. The fact that you can walk in with cash and simply receive crypto on a fresh wallet is something we can only dream of in most first world countries. 

It gave me vibes of how it might have felt for people who mined Bitcoin anonymously in 2011-2013, without wallets associated with their legal identity.

During a bear market in the cryptocurrency world, where prices are generally falling or stagnant, there are a few things you can consider doing:

Hold: One strategy is to simply hold onto your existing cryptocurrency investments and wait for the market to recover. Historically, cryptocurrencies have experienced boom and bust cycles, so it's possible that prices may recover in the future. However, it's important to remember that there's no guarantee of future price increases.

Dollar-cost averaging: Consider using a dollar-cost averaging strategy, which involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the current price of the cryptocurrency. This can help you avoid buying in at the peak of a market and can also help smooth out volatility in the short term.

Diversify: Consider diversifying your cryptocurrency portfolio by investing in different types of cryptocurrencies or in other asset classes such as stocks, bonds, or real estate. Diversification can help spread risk and potentially improve returns over the long term.

Research: Use the bear market as an opportunity to do research and analysis on different cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects. This can help you identify potential investment opportunities when the market eventually recovers.

Set stop-loss orders: If you are actively trading cryptocurrencies, consider setting stop-loss orders to limit your losses in case the market continues to decline. Stop-loss orders automatically trigger a sale when the price falls below a certain level, helping to minimize potential losses.

Now, where do we start!? I'm definitely Hodling and DCAing.

2. **File On Time:** If you can't pay your crypto taxes in full, don't panic! It's still essential to file your tax return on time or request an extension. Failing to do so can result in significant IRS tax penalties.
3. **IRS Payment Plans:** Can't pay your taxes in full? No problem! The IRS offers payment plans to help you pay your tax debt over time. Get in touch with our tax attorneys to learn more about your options.
4. **Don't Trust Crypto 1099s:** If you trade cryptocurrency, don't blindly trust your tax forms from exchanges. It's always better to double-check and ensure everything is correct to avoid mistakes. Many times the inofrmation on crypto 1099s is a small piece of your overall tax return.
5. **Ask a Pro:** If you're unsure how to report income or deductions, seek professional advice. Legal analysis is often required for crypto tax, and it's crucial to get it right to avoid penalties or audits.

By following these steps, you can confidently navigate the world of crypto taxes!

Although they were enthusiastic about it during the last bull run, they ultimately ended up losing money because they stick for too long. One friend in particular said something that made me feel extremely optimistic about cryptocurrency: ""**Crypto? Isn't it already dead? Get out of there.**"" The others seemed to have lost interest altogether.

Now, you may wonder why this made me bullish. It indicates that the cycle continues. After the 2017-2018 bull run, people were saying the same things. Most of them forgot about it until 2020, called it a ponzi. Even though the past does not necessarily predict the future, it tends to repeat itself in some ways.

Knowing that people who joined the last bull run have forgotten about its existence now excites me because they need to calm down, forget about it, and then, when the new bull run arrives, get excited again. This happened to me, and it will happen to them. The only difference is that this time, I will stick around! Remember, you are here during the bear market. If a bull market happens, you are guaranteed to make a profit\*.

This is not just some self-help motivational talk. It is a reality. Last time, I missed out, but I am not making the same mistake twice. I just wanted to see of anyone else related to my feeling or I'm just full of hopium

9/3/23,What are you going to do with your Nexo?,"I think it’s a shame they are leaving the US.  Have always been crap with communication and responses at times but overall a great experience.  It had so many great features allowing its users to survive or trade without selling.  The free transfers and low or no interest loans available definitely helped with the sleep factor. 

The utility of the token offset any price movements usually.  Nexo is an established business and if it survives this bear after all these other exchanges go down will only add value and potentially be a great one to hodl.   Of course I have been wrong before.  

Just looking for some opinions and thoughts on Nexo.   On that note, any suggestions on anywhere to fill the gap on buying abs selling?  Please don’t say Coinbase.  They will just eventually put me ‘under review’ and never respond to me again.

9/3/23,Dumbest thing I could possibly do.,"About 2 months ago I had a deposit of $7000 put into my bank account.
Not sure from who or where it came from but it’s been in there since and I have not touched it. With every check I try and not to go below $7000.
But recently I’ve been having tempting thoughts and I’m more than sane enough to realize this is a dumbass thought. 
I’ve been thinking of dropping that entire 7k into Chainlink. No I’m not shilling. But I love this project and it’s been pretty solid. I figured if I drop that much during this current dip I can probably make some money if it goes back up, I’d sell all of it, and put it back into my account and I’ll keep the profit to re-invest. Obviously I shouldn’t put my eggs in one basket and who knows if the bank will end up taking the money back either later today, tomorrow, a week from now? But scared money don’t make no money right? 
I just want to hear all your thoughts? What would you do if you were in my shoes?

Over time, only utilities NFT will become more popular and have higher price. Public will distance itself from creators or platform full of useless Jpeg NFT and guess which platform are the one that popularise or full of these in the first place with millions and millions of hashtags and tweets? 


Also will by using creator from another platform even help the original platform grow? No. Once a platform admit it's own users are of lower quality, and with millions of artist but none have the quality to match creator from other platform, it will create a massive outflow.

9/3/23,The Russian cryptocurrency market is asking Putin for help," 

The Russian Association of Crypto-economics, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain, an organization representing the Russian cryptocurrency and blockchain market, has appealed to President Vladimir Putin for help in creating regulations for the industry. Experts are concerned that the Russian Federation may lag behind other countries in this matter.

# The Russian cryptocurrency market is asking Putin for help 

The Russian Association of Crypto-economics, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain is asking Russian President Vladimir Putin for help. This concerns the support of the cryptocurrency community in shaping national regulatory frameworks for new technologies.

In a letter to the Russian head of state, members of the organization warn that the government's approach to regulating the digital asset market creates ""serious risks"" associated with delaying the economy in the field of ""new financial technologies.""

The association argues that the current state policy does not allow Russian companies to take advantage of the potential of new financial instruments. Furthermore, it forces them to move to other jurisdictions. This results in direct financial losses for the state treasury.

This ""exceptionally conservative and prohibitive approach"" may cause Russia's ""digital economy"" to slow down. This in turn will ""deprive the country of the opportunity to become a leader in the implementation of digital payment and accounting systems.""

In the letter sent to the president, they also reminded him of the meeting with IT associations that took place in 2019. At that time, discussions were held on new regulations. Although regulatory sandboxes were planned, these ideas were not implemented. Proposed changes to the Russian law on ""Digital Financial Assets"" also make it difficult to implement innovative solutions on the market.

But what exactly are the Russian experts demanding? They are asking the president to convene a meeting devoted to all the issues mentioned. They also suggest the formation of a working group that would prepare a pilot project for the introduction of digital financial technologies into the domestic market.  
 

# Will blockchain participate in the concert of superpowers? 

Russians may need blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and CBDCs to circumvent the sanctions imposed on their country by the West. After Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, trade with Russia has become difficult, which will eventually have a negative impact on the country's economy.

However, Russia and China are working to build an Eastern geopolitical and economic bloc that could compete with the US and its allies. An important element of the project is a blockchain-based response to SWIFT."

They were affected by the collapse of FTX and generally the crypto bear  market. They were a main bank to many crypto exchanges and entities. 
Now you have SVB (Silicon Valley bank) having to raise capital to continue operations. Supposedly they have a very limited exposure to crypto and the problem is actually two fold. Less venture capital flowing into the banks coupled with cash burn from businesses that aren’t profitable. It’s incredible that these banks are starting to faulter with interest rates so high. They obviously have the wrong kind of deposits and the ones they have are very depleted. We’ll probably see other banks having to raise capital or go down. Crypto markets are going negative"

The amount of recovered BTC (worth roughly $3 billion) expected to begin making its way back to Mt. Gox creditors this Friday, nearly a decade after the now-defunct crypto exchange — which was one of the earliest on the market — was hacked and drained of 850,000 BTC in 2014. Market onlookers are waiting to see if the large repayments will impact BTC’s price, especially if creditors choose to liquidate, adding sell pressure across the market.

This got me thinking though, we are tied to solidity mainly from Ethereum. 

What does Solidity not do well? 

I've seen a few projects pushing the idea that solidity leaves room for errors in smart contracts that leads to scams/stolen funds. Like giving complete access to your wallet with just connecting to a site. Aka all the NFT scams that are posted once a week in this reddit.

The biggest thing though (as a programmer not involved in crypto) why don't we have a cryptocurrency based in python/java/rust? Can't we add libraries to existing languages to accomplish this? I would think this would lead to more widespread dapps being written."
9/3/23,Does Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) Work?,"We have a lot of discussion here on whether DCA works.  

As we start to recover from the Crypto Winter of 2022 let's take a look using an example of DCA if you had been completely clueless about crypto and started buying at the exact all-time high of Bitcoin on November 10, 2021, at a price of **$69,044.77**.

*DCA*

If you had bought **$10** a day (the price of a typical lunch in the US) from November 10, 2021 until today, March 9, 2023, here are the stats:

&#x200B;

1. You would have spent a total of **$4,850**.  
2. You would now own **0.18767 BTC** with a value of **$4,070**.  
3. Your total profit-loss would be **-15.99%** with fiat loss of **-$775** USD.

&#x200B;

*Lump Sum*

If you had just FOMO'ed $4,850 on November 10,2021, here are the stats:

&#x200B;

1. You would have spent a total of **$4,850**.
2. You would now own **0.07223 BTC** with a value of **$1,570**.
3. Your total profit-loss would be **-67.66%** with a fiat value of **-$3,280** USD.

*Conclusion*

As you can see DCA works.  It particularly works with Bitcoin.

Not only that, but with a PNL of -15.99%, your ROI on just DCAing Bitcoin is better than most people who started investing in various Alts and moonshots in 2021 who are down -90%+.  You did all this with absolutely no stress, no constant chart watching, and no worries of VC rug pulls, bridge hacks, bad tokenomics, changing narratives, or other risks associated with investing in the flavor of the month Alt coins."

""To the Algorand community,

We are writing with the latest updates we have available regarding the security breach impacting users of MyAlgo, a third-party wallet created by Rand Labs. 

First and foremost, we understand this is a truly difficult time for the community, in which real people and projects have been impacted. Those affected are our community members and builders and we can only imagine the pain this has caused. Any type of security breach in our industry tests our resilience, but we believe we will move forward together as a community.

In the wake of the breach, we have engaged Halborn, a best-in-class blockchain security firm, to help investigate and combat this hack on behalf of those impacted. We have also engaged Chainalysis to help trace compromised wallet transfers and freeze funds if they are deposited in an exchange that integrates with and acts upon Chainalysis data.

Investigations are ongoing with relevant law enforcement agencies in an attempt to recover the stolen funds from privately owned wallets across the following exchanges and partners: Changenow, Kucoin, and Circle, all of whom are aware of attacker wallet addresses. If you’ve been impacted, we encourage you to reach out to your local law enforcement authorities, if you have not already.

If you are still holding assets in a MyAlgo Wallet, you should immediately withdraw funds to, or rekey to, newly created accounts outside of MyAlgo, or to a hardware wallet. Below, you can find tutorials below on how to rekey to other wallets, and [here](https://info.algorand.foundation/e3t/Ctc/UC+113/d33Vc-04/VX2V5j6V1CS1W1Y15K02gf7RtW2F3lfm4XVH1rN5j5FQw3lLBGV1-WJV7CgXwjW5Z9Hmb6gh6BsVL5_k72bPftrW7-NZ7b1ffz--W7r_m9F3KhydMW58Rhmy328fWyW8qc7Cd4kcbHHW4PSBYT8Gf7VkW6BXlkK42hpSpW9fGQTW4GshhcVSkLPG5BmKL_W2Hc1PK7xnFlbW75bfdN3ck34ZW1kspXP3k4GL3W2WS_9s4t8CSDW1dSSRP74Pj1zW4wZZHm1SMxP7W49sxWb18Lz_rW8mTw1z7zJFmjW34SyxV5P0qnHW6lYl4m5WJjw7W3h09bt8gL4yDW6BS9rt4N1JtnVgZbNq7bP0-nV-CWMX1srByP38RJ1) you can find more detailed information on wallet security best practices. 

As we have previously stated–and remains true–the Algorand protocol has not been compromised.

We will continue to share further updates with the community as they become available, and will continue to provide technical expertise and support to all parties involved. We are here with you.

I started with Binance, but they forbid trading derivatives in my country (not their fault, we could say, but I registered to the international branch and never asked to be tranferred to the local one). Then I moved to PrimeXBT, but their tools are just simply awful. Then I've reading about Bybit, but everything I find out about them is incredibly sketchy (I've found more complaints than advantages). Then I thought, well, since this is crypto, maybe I could move to a decentralized exchange like DYDX... but either I don't understand what decentralized is or they are definitely not decentralized (so zero advantages there). Then I thought about using a trading terminal... but then I remembered the supposed 3Commas API key leaks.

So, I guess my question is: is there any place where you can just trade derivatives with proper tools without having to worry about sketchy tangential issues or do I need to move outside the crypto space to do so?

[by proper tools I mean: pre-programmed conditional orders with the reduce-only possibility, simultaneous opposite-side trades, quick in-chart modification of parameters, several criteria for conditional orders, etc]"

\-

In the bear market, many less solid projects with worse fundamentals can lose much of their funding and incentives for developers to continue working.

This causes the development of these projects to decrease a lot. And there are those where theirs ‘building’ even stops altogether — regardless of market capitalization.

On the other hand, there are those projects whose development remains solid and strong, regardless of short and medium term price volatility.

The ‘building’ and constant work to improve a cryptocurrency can be a great indication of strong fundamentals and a solid project.

## Counterpoints about building

Even so, like any market indicator, this feature should never be considered in isolation to make important decisions. Context and other data are vitally important.

Some counterpoints that can be observed:

* **New (fresh) projects** can have a lot of development activity, just because they are in their initial phase. The older and more active a project is, the better.
* **More consolidated** projects may have low development activity, just because a lot has already been done for a long time.

That said, we can still find good opportunities when looking at activity and engagement in cryptocurrency ‘building’ — and, considering such a saturated market, this can be a great filter.

## Top 20 crypto projects with the most activity in the last 03 months

I collected the number of 'commits' made in some projects, according to the [CryptoMiso.com](https://www.cryptomiso.com/months_3.html) website and got the 20 cryptocurrencies (or tokens) with the most activity in the last three months.

For this report, I filtered out projects with less than 1,000 'watchers' and very recent ones, as my goal is to find solidity and good opportunities.

https://preview.redd.it/kon0xv5psrma1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=76036f3e8493cb65943919c169bc3a3311ee5e5a

In order, we have:

* **Internet Computer** · ICP - 1,331
* **Mina** · MINA - 943
* **Solana** · SOL - 632
* **Mask Network** · MASK - 612
* **PancakeSwap** · CAKE - 414
* **eCash** · XEC - 375
* **SushiSwap** · SUSHI - 336
* **Chainlink** · LINK - 328
* **Cosmos** · ATOM - 320
* **NEAR Protocol** · NEAR - 247
* **Bitcoin** · BTC - 234
* **Chia Network** · XCH - 234
* **Status** · SNT - 221
* **Storj** · STORJ - 218
* **Polkadot** · DOT - 195
* **Lisk** · LSK - 182
* **Ethereum** · ETH - 167
* **Nano** · XNO - 157
* **Trust Wallet Token** · TWT - 152
* **TRON** · TRX - 148

## n#C/MCap — what is it and what does it indicate?

Knowing how to identify the projects that continue to work and build is very important, but for those who are looking for good investment opportunities, we can further refine our analysis by weighting the number of 'commits' with the current market capitalization.

Again, this indicator should not be considered in isolation to make important decisions. It's just… **An indicator**. Which can help.

To do this, we then divide the number of 'commits' in the last three months by the respective current 'market cap' (MAR 09, 2023) and multiply the result by 1,000,000 for better visualization.

* **Storj** · STORJ - 4.33
* **Mask Network** · MASK - 2.82
* **Status** · SNT - 2.37
* **Mina** · MINA - 1.54

I see that bitcoin price barely reacts to CPI, mostly 500$ or less change on CPI announcements, which is not much, it's just a normal day in crypto. And this change usually reverses in a few days.

9/3/23,[SERIOUS] Do you hold Algo? Check your wallet ASAP!," The Algorand blockchain has been gaining popularity among cryptocurrency enthusiasts because of its high throughput and scalability. However, recent reports suggest that the blockchain is experiencing an issue due to a third-party wallet provider, MyAlgo, that has suffered an exploit, resulting in the loss of Algos from users' wallets.

Hundreds users have reported waking up to find their Algos missing from their wallets. This has raised concerns about the security of the Algorand blockchain (which itself has proven not have have any issue) and the use of third-party wallet provider, MyAlgo.

Fortunately, there are measures that users can take to protect their Algos. One such measure is the Rekey process. Rekeying involves changing the account's private key, which ensures that any transaction requires a new signature to be authorized. This process effectively blocks any unauthorized access to the account.

To rekey an Algorand account, users need to generate a new account address and transfer the signature of their transactions to this new wallet. This can be done through the two other Algorand wallets (Pera and Defly) and also using a Ledger! 

Another option for users is to use a hardware wallet like Ledger to store their Algos. Hardware wallets are known for their superior security features, making them a safe option for users.

Lastly, users can create a new wallet and transfer their Algos to the new wallet. This option is recommended for users who suspect that their old wallet has been compromised and are not part-taking in Governance.

In conclusion, the recent MyAlgo exploit has highlighted the importance of security measures in the cryptocurrency space. Algorand users who have been affected should take immediate action to protect their assets by either rekeying their account, using a hardware wallet, or creating a new wallet. As always, it is crucial to exercise caution when using third-party wallet providers and only use reputable providers with a track record of security."

The only thing to do is make choices, and you make choices based on what makes sense at the time.   If you suddenly feel like day trading, you don't need to plan that unless you have a strict jerking off schedule, which you would have to plan the time and day you want to start trading, and you don't need s plan to hold.

One was before the bearish sentiment on Wednesday. Anyway Kraken support wrote me that my second payment is on hold. Apparently if they receive 2 payments with exact amount within 72 hours then they automatically assume it might be bank error of sending twice and hold the second payment for 2 more working days before they release in your account. So now I am waiting but since i buy the first dip i see may be the delay works out in my favor as market seems its going south.

Anyway I am making this post so that peple are aware of this issue. Kraken support kindly also told me the solution to not fall in this issue. The trick is to change the amount by slight amount like 1 more or less. So I should have sent 999 the second time and the amount would have been immediately deposited. Hope this info helps someone in future . Sometimes your fund stuck for 2 extra days could be expensive."

So 12ish hours later another person made a post following up saying he actually guessed a wallet, and got in. But it was a 12 word deed phrase. 

He said there was no money on the wallet, but what the heck. This is terrifying, if you read the comments of the follow up post it wouldn’t take a brain surgeon to know how concerned everyone was. 

Now yes of course he was provided with 24 words, and he got lucky. But what if this happened to any of us. If we don’t own a ledger, our assets with a 12 word seed phrase is so guessable. Of course this is all a very low chance. But even if one wallet a day gets compromised because someone guessed it. 

And even worse, what if the next latest and greatest scam is using the fasted computers we have, and having it guess wallets thousands of times a day. 

It’s terrifying, and it’s a very possible thing to happen, and what if 500 million more people get into Crypto next bull run. 

There’s gotta be 1 of those people who make a software to log into wallets by guessing the seed phrase."

Sure some of these altcoins might promise insane gains, but let's be real, it's usually just a trap. I'll stick with my slow and steady Bitcoin growth, thank you very much.

So I start searching for some data about how much does billionaires and millionaires waste, since they will never regulate them

their yachts:

""It has been estimated a superyacht with permanent crew, helicopter pad, submarines and pools emits about **7,020 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year**, more than 1,500 times higher than a typical family car ""

"" The yacht owned by Roman Abramovich, the billionaire who built a fortune off of trading gas and oil, for example, was responsible for 22,440 metric tons of carbon emissions that year "" His yacht alone made  5610 more emission that the AVG person does in a year

To give you an idea the AVG person:

 The average carbon footprint for a person in the United States is **16 tons**, one of the highest rates in the world. Globally, the average carbon footprint is closer to **4 tons**. 

What about the Jets

 ""And a recent report by Yard, a UK-based sustainability marketing agency, analyzed flight data of the celebrities with the worst private jet emissions. Taylor Swift topped the list at more than 170 flights since January, totaling up to 15.9 days in the air, and 8,293.54 metric tons of CO2 emissions—that’s equivalent to all the emissions from the energy used by over 1,000 homes in the U.S. for a year.""

This are just two examples only, it's much worse than that

&#x200B;

"" Global electricity generation for the crypto-assets with the largest market capitalizations resulted in a combined 140 ± 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year (Mt CO2/y), or about 0.3% of global annual greenhouse gas emissions ""

9/3/23,What is the Price Potential of Moons and Why?,"Firstly, let's quickly go over what the Moon Token is for those who may not be familiar. The Moon Token is a cryptocurrency that was created specifically for the Reddit community. It is used as a reward for contributing to the community in the form of quality posts and comments. Users who receive Moon Tokens can then use them to tip other users, donate to charity, or even trade them on various exchanges.

Now, onto the price potential. At the time of writing this post, the Moon Token is trading at around $0.21 but the scope for growth is massive and always improving. 

 Growing Community: The /r/CryptoCurrency subreddit has over 3 million members, and this number is growing every day. As more people become interested in cryptocurrency and join the subreddit, the demand for Moon Tokens will increase.

 Increased Adoption: As the Moon Token gains more recognition and acceptance, we may start to see it being used on other platforms and websites. This will increase its adoption rate and demand, leading to a rise in price. We've already seen it with advertisers even with Kraken recently. This also may in turn prove its usecase and encourage Kraken to list it in the near future. 

 Unique Use Case: The Moon Token is the first cryptocurrency created specifically for a Reddit community. This uniqueness makes it stand out from other cryptocurrencies, which could attract more investors and speculators.

 Limited Supply: There are only 250 million Moon Tokens in circulation, and this number will not increase. As demand for the token grows, the limited supply will create scarcity, driving up the price.

Pedicting the price of any coin is never a sure thing so I won't bother. However, considering the factors mentioned above, I believe that the Moon Token has a lot of potential for growth. We all want that $1 so to the Moon."

AI generated art has seem some criticism (***let me be clear that I agree that people really hate on AI generated art, especially because it is often connected to NFTs)***, but overall people are really excited and supportive of AI companies, like ""OpenAI.""

But who is making the money in AI? It's mega corporations. Meanwhile in crypto it was the average person who mostly benefited.

I just find it so ironic. Those in crypto are accused of grift, calling crypto Ponzi schemes, etc. The mere mention of your interest in crypto can get you attacked online, with accusations of running scams, hating the environment, and even sacrificing children the Satan (maybe I exaggerated there).

But even as AI causes big corporate money to flow, excluding the average person from profiting, as is traditionally the case, that's fine.

I will be so excited the moment that some web3 operation comes out with something comparable to GPT, and uses crypto to manage its governance and pay for its fees."

9/3/23,The Future of Crypto: Predictions for 2023,"Hey everyone,

As we kick off another exciting year in the world of cryptocurrency, I thought it would be fun to make some predictions for what's to come in 2023. Here are a few of my top picks:

&#x200B;

* **Mainstream adoption:** With more and more people getting interested in cryptocurrency, we can expect to see a surge in mainstream adoption in the next few years. From major corporations to everyday consumers, crypto is poised to become a staple in our digital economy.

&#x200B;

* **Increased regulation:** As the crypto market grows, we can also expect to see more regulation and oversight from governments around the world. This will likely be a double-edged sword, providing greater stability and security but also potentially limiting the freedom and decentralization that makes crypto so unique.

&#x200B;

* **The rise of DeFi:** Decentralized finance (DeFi) has been a major buzzword in the crypto community for a few years now, and I predict it will only continue to grow in popularity and functionality. With DeFi platforms offering everything from lending to trading to insurance, it's clear that the future of finance is decentralized.

&#x200B;

* **NFTs go mainstream:** Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have already made a splash in the art world, but I predict we'll see them become even more widespread in 2023. From virtual real estate to collectibles to in-game items, NFTs have the potential to revolutionize the way we think about ownership and value in the digital realm.

&#x200B;

* **New innovations and technologies:** Finally, I predict we'll see a host of new innovations and technologies emerge in the crypto space in the next few years. Whether it's faster and more efficient blockchain protocols, new types of consensus algorithms, or entirely new use cases for crypto, the possibilities are endless.

&#x200B;

* **Last but not the least, moons hit $10:** Yes, it will happen folks, we're all gonna be millionaires this year :D

Of course, these are just a few of my personal predictions - I'd love to hear what you all think the future holds for cryptocurrency in 2023 and beyond. Let's keep pushing forward and embracing the potential of this exciting new technology *(and reddit moons :)!*"

Several very credible right-wing media outlets have confirmed that Donald Trump will be releasing ""MAGA"" coins to fund his 2024 campaign.

""I can tell you this"" Donald said in an interview, ""It's going to be euuuuge. The world has never seen a coin like ours. Our coin is going to be the biggest, the bestest, and the most shiniest coin of all the coins out there.

""The American people are tired of being scammed by losers like Sam Bankrupt-Fried and that guy in CHI-NA. My coins will be in American vaults only. Look at my vault, it has millions of coins, more coins than Scrooge McDuck even.""

This comes as a pleasant surprise to many red-blooded Americans. ""Users will now be able to be scammed domestically with good old American made rugpulls, rather than lose their money overseas""

""Let me tell you. Our new freedom tokens (NFTs) were a huge success. You'll never hear CNN talk about it, but they were.""

When asked what his thoughts on cryptocurrency were, he still reiterated his stance that crypto is a scam and asked us why we were even discussing crypto when the subject was about shiny coins.

After a bit of research I managed to find their Telegram group - I faked a few platitudes for their cause and managed to get into their ""Ethereum Fud: Leadership Generals"" group chat.

Over the past week they've been running a FUD campaign against ETH by creating a fictitious crisis by the name of ""Silvergate"" - they've managed to dump ETH 10% but Moons are still up 20%...So they're going to be stepping up their efforts.

They're going to be faking an announcement that the SEC declared ETH a security. Please be prepared for a crash, if these Fudders are able to implement the same level of fear in the market as they did creating a fictitious ""Silvergate"" crisis. They could hit ETH with a 1, 2 and we could be looking at the Sub $1K prices that this team is currently aiming for.

There plot has already spread to Twitter, and from a pure engagement standpoint it looks like they have more power and influence then we initially thought - especially considering they were able to invent a crisis that has almost all Crypto assets struggling.

9/3/23,10k ETH bounty for wallet recovery,"Hi all, I've got a story to share.


In Jan of 2021, the bulls in the market were just gearing up for the run with most of my friends already having built positions in the market over the prior months. It was late Jan and ETH had already risen around 100% just this month alone. I saw my friends' net worth rise from just hundreds of millions to quite a few billions which seemed nuts for just sitting at home and lurking around reddit. My agitation was growing every passing day and I couldn't resist the FOMO.

I finally decided to pull the trigger on 27th of Jan and signed up with Bitfinex since most of my friends had recommended it. I went all in and bought 25k ETH and was feeling more glorious than ever before after random billionaires were talking about who could've possibly made this purchase. I bought them at an average price of $1609.27 and was pretty thrilled about the future.

Like I had learned from this sub, self-custody is king and I wanted to be the king. I set up a new ether wallet, wrote down my seed phrase on a piece of paper and sent ETH to this new wallet. It was almost an hour but my ETH was nowhere to be seen. I was in the toilet the whole time refreshing my wallet every few seconds. Almost 87 mins later, my ETH was finally here. I finally shat in peace while looking at the charts.

A few months down, ETH had 3xed in value and I was ecstatic beyond what I can express. Then came May where all my friends started taking profits and selling most of their holdings. The price kept dropping so fast that I couldn't hold my nerve when it almost fell through $2k. I decided to exit from my investment before I was in the red.

I went and grabbed the piece of paper on which I wrote my seed-phrase. The paper was intact but the 3rd and 9th word had smudged because I wrote this with an ink pen and had folded that paper before I hid it. I can clearly see that the 3rd word starts with an i but I've no recollection what this could possibly be. From its length, it looked like a 5-letter word but it could've been 4 too. About the 9th word, I had no clue. I tried out various possibilities I could think of but nothing worked as I slipped into insanity.

I then reached out to a few of my friends explaining the situation and asking for help. I got redirected to a few wallet recovery services that I immediately reached out to. I hired the one with the best track record even though their fees were 1.5x the average ask but I didn't wanna take any chances. It was all of my inheritance after all. They've been running over a thousand scripts since then but haven't been able to unlock my wallet yet while I've already spent over $2 mn.

I came across [this](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/11lvr29/100_in_eth_if_you_guess_the_order_of_my_seed/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) post yesterday by u/timelesssmidgen experimenting with the resilience of BIP39. That post made me cry so much that I had to take some amphetamines to calm myself down. I finally mustered the courage to write this down with hopes that a few more people trying to crack my seed would slimly improve my chances of getting access to my wallet if not more.

I don't wanna leave any stones unturned so here are the details:

Wallet address - 0x8c11bda622E6780ff36E5b4d887db5d186367df9v

12-word seed phrase in the correct order - modify off i*** size divide clean off assault ***** magnet glory embody

You can check this on Etherscan [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8c11bda622E6780ff36E5b4d887db5d186367df9).

If any of you are able to gain access to the wallet, I'm willing to pay about 10k ETH from the recovered funds. Please dm me if you've cracked it so that we could then discuss further details. I shall also share evidence of my ownership of this wallet at this stage so we could split the funds.

I've almost lost hopes of ever seeing my funds again so I'm at least hoping this will get me some moons if not my ETH. I want to be a whale again by the next run up.

Edit - thanks to the couple people who reached out to me instantly after I posted this. However, it'd be helpful if you message me only after you gain access to the wallet address I've posted. I've already hired a wallet recovery service and don't wish to spend more. Thanks again!"

This is some kind of surprise considering the nature of the government (they like to have control of everything) but well, I suppose they had to be less ambitious and not take everything for them.

In this case, it is the tax on large financial transactions (IGTF) is a tax that you have to pay if you move money at it is set by 2% also if you pay in USD cash you have to add 3% more tax, if you pay or transfer crypto you avoid that 5%.

Of course, this only affects ""legal"" transactions done and reported to the SENIAT (like IRS) for off the record and P2P this doesn't apply.

The fund has purchased claims against the now-defunct cryptocurrency trading platform and will receive an early payout in September, constituting 90% of the total collectible amount, with approximately 70% of it being in Bitcoin and 30% in cash. The decision to hold on to the recovered Bitcoins is significant since the bankruptcy trustee is expected to repay the creditors with Bitcoin as well. However, UBS strategists have stated that the upcoming Mt. Gox bankruptcy repayments are unlikely to impact the price of Bitcoin. The deadline for rehabilitation creditors to register their payment preferences has been postponed to March 10, giving more time for the creditors to complete the process. The Mt. Gox rehabilitation plan has been under development for several years now, and the bankruptcy proceedings may continue for some time.

9/3/23,How money is(n't) created in Canada,"A recent post [""How money is created in Canada""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/11luk8c/how_money_is_created_in_canadawhat_a_ponzi/)... which needs more detail than a small screenshot and a terse comment can provide. 

The Bank of Canada functions similarly to the Fed (a clearinghouse, but with quasi-political mandates stapled to it)... but unlike the Fed, the BoC is unusually clearer in their language (Probably a result of not being the perceived CEO of the global reserve currency). 

In Canada ""reserves"" are called ""settlement balances"". Per the BoC's communications - [COVID QE response communication)](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2020/08/our-covid-19-response-large-scale-asset-purchases/):

>Our economy depends on credit. When the financial system is working, households and businesses have access to credit. For example, people might take out a mortgage to buy a house or use a line of credit to pay for their child’s braces. And companies may need money to expand and create jobs, so they might borrow from investors through financial markets.

This is also true of USD globally. It's mostly credit. 

So, when the Fed issues ""reserves"" as part of QE, it's often labelled as ""money printing"", but when Canada issues ""reserves"" under a QE program? Well: 

>How are we paying for these assets(QE)? **There is a common misconception that we are just printing money, but this isn’t the case.** We pay for these purchases with settlement balances (reserves). In effect, settlement balances act like loans from financial institutions to us. When we buy assets, we borrow from financial institutions by crediting them with a deposit of settlement balances in the accounts they have at the Bank of Canada. 

Canada is clear that their reserve issuance isn't money printing. What actually takes place, is that commercial banks/primary dealers buy the assets *first* (sometimes utilizing pre-existing ""settlement balances"", but mostly via wholesale market funding).

This wholesale market is broadly dollar based (USD) and is often called the eurodollar or shadow banking system... in reality, it's just a network of interconnected global banks and bank-like institutions. 

Canadian dollar supply relies on the ability of Canadian banks to obtain funding via exchange, swaps, repo, etc.. and importantly; collateral. Collateral is required for most of these activities. This global funding market is one of the primary sources of balance sheet expansion (for all global banks). 

Canada is inextricably tied to this global US dollar funding system, where USD denominated collateral is king. We have a close relationship and active trade with the US, but we are greatly at risk of an inability to generate/obtain/participate in dollar funding. As per the BIS, the [implications for financial stability are hard to assess](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/11fab9r/a_note_on_banks_and_swaps/)... and indeed they are, as Canada (and the world) will be more and more sensitive to currency and maturity mismatches, and collateral shortages going forward. 

Alright.. and now a geopolitical opinion (I'm just a banker, so grain of salt):

Canada will likely be the first G7 country to implode via an inability to participate in dollar funding markets (although this may take a while). Our implosion is less likely to occur via Canadian government/household debt levels than it is due to constraints imposed by collateral shortages at the wholesale level (we'll pop before anyone else in the G7.... However, we are also more likely to see further sovereignty erasure, and greater vassal-ification by the US or other entities abroad... before anything resembling a total default)."

The first three halvings of bitcoin occurred in 2012, 2016 and 2020. Let's look at how $100 invested in bitcoin at the time of the halvings increased in the months following those halvings.

After 10-17 months, this $100 had increased to $9,600 (halving of 2012), $2,200 (halving of 2016) and $600 (halving of 2020). After reaching these high values, the price of bitcoin lost more than 70% in the months thereafter.

A simplified analogy helps to understand what happens after halving. Consider a city with a growing population in which, say, 1,000 new flats are built each month. If 1,000 new people arrive in the city each month, the price of flats remains stable: everything that comes onto the market finds a buyer.

If, in 2020, a law suddenly limited the construction of new flats to 500 from one month to the next and 1,000 people continued to arrive each month, the price of flats would undoubtedly rise, because 500 new arrivals would be without housing. Perhaps existing owners would start selling their flats, thereby pocketing healthy profits (and informing their neighbors about it). And the more prices rise, the more recent and old owners will be willing to sell their flats (and the more new people will be willing to buy and hope to profit from the rise). Until no one is willing to pay the by now unrealistic prices and the bubble bursts. It seems possible to me (but of course way from certain) that the bitcoin price will follow a similar trajectory following the next halving of 2024.

At present, any method used to buy bitcoins carries risks. For this reason, I split my purchases equally between three methods: a cold wallet, a centralized exchange and an ETP holding physical bitcoins. I know the saying ""not your keys, not your coins"" but I also know that probably millions of bitcoins have been lost and certainly some of these losses are due to people no longer having access to their cold wallets. By splitting my purchases into three separate pots, I don't need to predict which one is likely to fail. In the unlikely event that one of them goes to zero, the price of bitcoin “only” needs to gain 50% from the purchasing price for me to recover the initial capital.

I believe in the long-term potential of bitcoin: *The Bitcoin Standard*'s argument that in the long run, the form of currency most difficult to produce will prevail seems plausible to me. But I also think that there will be price bubbles in the future. My (temporary) exit strategy: I plan to sell 70-80% of the money invested in bitcoin 10-15 months after the halving of 2024 when the bubble will likely reach its limit. After the next bubble bursts, I will gradually buy back bitcoin.

Let’s see in early 2025 if this post has aged like milk or wine.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this."

The announcement came shortly after Silvergate Bank's holding company, Silvergate Capital Corporation, announced it would be winding down operations due to ""recent industry and regulatory developments."" Marathon said the move would free up over $68 million worth of Bitcoin held as collateral for the loan, eliminate $50 million worth of debt, and reduce annual borrowing costs by $5 million. The company had secured a $100 million revolving credit facility with Silvergate Bank in October 2021, which it intended to use to fund its mining operations. Marathon is the second-biggest publicly listed holder of Bitcoin after MicroStrategy.

Please view the video at bitdirect.io


As an Advisor / Co-signer, you can perform the following tasks for your clients:

Educate them on everything bitcoin related. 

Manage an additional multisignature key for their hardware device.

Restore access if they lose their hardware device and recovery seed. 

Perform a secondary signing process when they send bitcoin. 

Send bitcoin to beneficiaries in an inheritance planning scenario.

9/3/23,What are your top recommendations for those new to cryptocurrency?,"The top cryptocurrencies did well in February despite worries about inflation, a competitive labor market, and future interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve. The most profitable of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization in February was Polygon (MATIC), which had a gain of 6.6%.  


These are some of the most well-liked cryptocurrencies that Redditors suggest, own, and support. As of March 6, these cryptocurrencies are likewise under $25 in price, making it simple for newcomers to trading in them: Cartesi, Metis, Dogecoin, Sandbox, and Solana.  


What do you think of this beginner's option? In any of these, would you invest or have you already done so?  


Flynt Finance is typically where I go when I'm planning things like buying some new cryptos because it is useful as a platform for portfolio management.  


Polygon, what about it? Nowadays, in my opinion, it's a need because it works so effectively and because the cost of all the Different network plans may go up much further. Just my personal perspective, though.

9/3/23,"NFT trade volume is a sign of a fundamental fall in the value of the Ethereum network, which could cause a price drop","Ethereum tests $1,700 on the strength of booming NFT activity.   


The amount of ETH burned since February 14 has decreased by more than 50%, reaching 2,700 ETH on March 5. The scarcity that results from burning more ETH drives up the price.  


As a result, the decrease in burn rate has probably had a significant impact on the net supply of ETH over the past few weeks. In addition, if the trend continues, Ethereum may enter a bearish zone.  


NFT trade volume is a sign of a fundamental fall in the value of the Ethereum network, which could cause a price drop.  


I discovered the information that NFT trading activity on the Ethereum network has declined since mid-February, according to on-chain data by blockchain analytics company Santiment. I should also inquire with Toshi Tools.  


In March 2023, will ETH Fall Below $1,500?

9/3/23,What do you think about the crypto market volatility comparing the last year and now?,"When I read that over 75% of respondents to a Paxos study were optimistic about the future of cryptocurrencies, I began to consider this question.  


Despite a turbulent year for the developing asset class, surveys in the U.S. undoubtedly showed interest in cryptocurrencies.  


75% of the 5,000 working-age Americans questioned in the United States are still ""confident or fairly confident in the future of crypto."" Adults who made over $50,000, had bank accounts, and had purchased cryptocurrency in the last three years were included in the poll, which took place on January 5 and 6.  


Several tools, notably Toshi, are welcomed. I've been keeping track of everything, and along with this poll, I had faith that cryptocurrency will rebound despite a challenging year in 2022, especially in light of the demise of FTX. Nonetheless, individuals are still drawn to digital things.  


Yet, I don't think it's odd that 72% of respondents said they were ""a little worried or not bothered at all"" about the volatility of the crypto markets over the previous year."

Some analysts believe that the company's massive holdings of Dogecoin could lead to a significant increase in the cryptocurrency's price. What do you think about that?

-It is designed to be a network uncontrollable by centralized influence

- It is totally limitless, with immensely scalable, ultra low-cost transactions that combine with empowering infrastructure like data capsules, AI tooling, and pluggable earn launcher.

It's amazing how the  CryptoGPT ecosystem can turn every task in our daily life into a source of income and I can't help believing it's the beginning of an AI revolution in this space.

9/3/23,[Signalling Poll] Multisig Members Inactivity - Vote for Potential Solutions to Delayed Distributions 🍩,"Hello,

In my proposal discussion yesterday (8th March 2023) a number of potential solutions were posited to the problem of delayed distrubutions. Thanks for all of your engagement.

Link to discussion post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/11lvvu8/proposal_distribution_honest_and_open/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button

Donut distribution requires a majority of 6/10 of the multisig members to sign. The problem is that 5 of these appear inactive, causing delays to several rounds including the latest distro being two weeks late. 

When discussing, a number of different solutions are possible and each is subtly different. 

This poll is to guage interest in which of the solutions to take through to full YES/NO governance poll and voted on by the community. If more than one solution is different enough, anybody can potentially introduce their own governance polls. 

Ideas to explore the future not included in this poll:

- Increase mod earnings via distrubution to reward for their good work keeping quality up and scams down

- Late distro penalty to inactive multisig members, the penalty to be used/recirculated/put in community fund. 



Please cast your vote and/or comment, especially if I missed an option you'd like to see enacted and especially point out any glaring mistakes with content or post format, never done this before. Thanks! 



Disclaimer:

- Multisig holder is simply a trusted guardian of the community, and is nothing to do with modship. Although many multisig members are mods, the two are unrelated positions.

- Please note I am just one of you, absolutely none of these are my personal suggestions or opinions and I have no vested interest, monetary or otherwise, in the outcome of this in any fashion outside of us all being granted our distribution of Donuts on time. 

- In case I dont say it enough - I love the sub and community.

The taxes don’t just stop at the corporate door, oh no sir! These naughty boys will show up in the most unexpected places. There is going to be a new 30% tax on electricity used in cryptocurrency mining.

The White House wants to make cryptocurrency unprofitable, and taxing it appears to be the easiest way.

First they hate it. Then they try to ban it. And when everything else fails... they activate their trap card! They tax it!

The White House says it’s “hindering the transition to a low-emission energy future”. The cover story is that crypto trading is using too much energy.

Website: https://shikoku.io

On launch Vitalik was airdropped 500 trillion tokens with an open letter:

https://shikoku.io/letter.pdf

https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3feadf4902e586fe67bd73ccb37f42118d882f9392bc062120871fb6b3540c 1a

On 7th March, around 4am UTC, Vitalik sold all 500 trillion #SHIK tokens for 379 ETH: 

Transaction 1 (214 ETH):
https://etherscan.io/tx/0x31bad8408dd5eaff1883445eb88df606755bb560df45d4a2327526f172a0b 814

Transaction 2 (72 ETH):
https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe48e17e0a1baf1fcf966c201701a725bef7ed73296550fa47f1973a2059201 49

Transaction 3 (90 ETH):
https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe99a5097f8522e0a7587bc3a412add4743d00daab377ad1e3e59618b69c0 b9f0

From Transactions 2 and 3, he stored those ETH within his personal wrapped Ethereum wallet:

https://etherscan.io/token/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2?a=0xab5801a7d3983 51b8be11c439e05c5b3259aec9b

However the most interesting movement is Transaction 1. Vitalik moved 214 ETH to a wallet called the ETHDev:

https://etherscan.io/token/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2?a=0xde0b295669a9fd 93d5f28d9ec85e40f4cb697bae

This wallet is the ETH Foundation wallet. 

What is the ETH Foundation wallet: What’s The Ethereum Foundation Anyway?

According to Ethereum’s official site: https://ethereum.org/en/foundation/:
“The EF is not a company, or even a traditional non-profit. Their role is not to control or lead Ethereum, nor they are the only organization that funds critical development of Ethereum-related technologies. The EF is one part of a much larger ecosystem.”

The Ethereum Foundation distributes funds to developers via the Ecosystem Support Program and the Fellowship Program, organizes Devcom, and more. To do all that, they surely need Fiat currency in some capacity.

With this information, do with it what you wish but I think Vitalik has sent a signal to #SHIK family that he has used some of that funding to help support developers..

Vitalik - you profited of free money here. Donate the remaining 165 ETH to a good cause and give the community of SHIK the recognition they deserve for helping. They are a great decentralised community.

9/3/23,"Am I the only one appalled at the hidden fees? For example, 5.5% when purchasing gift cards with CRO","I'm a Jade Green customer, and have been since 2019. Call me OG if you wish. I haven't used CDC lately other than topping up the card for direct purchases, but now I wanted to order a larger meal (for a group) from Uber Eats, and I thought I'd get a gift card from CDC. After all, I get at least 5% cashback if I purchase with CRO.

Purchasing CRO from GBP and then using the CRO to purchase the giftcard gave a net 5.5% loss.

Please don't say *""it's just spread""*. Normal spread is when it's due to market forces. This is pure and simple hidden fees enforced by CDC as there is no market, CDC is in full control. I imagine most users are on a lower tier, and get lured in by the **""5% cashback""** not realizing that they are in fact **still** netting a loss. It's way past *""the price you pay for convenience""*. It's predatory at this point.

As many others do, I use coinbase to buy crypto with using money from my registered business. I'm a holder and don't pay much attention to my investments, though it seems that my account has been completely deleted for ""prohibited use in violation of our Terms of Service"" on the 8th of august. What's weird is that I received these 2 E-mails at the exact same time down to the minute [https://imgur.com/a/UeFo862](https://imgur.com/a/UeFo862). It seems a bit weird that coinbase almost congratulated me for deleting my account while at the same time giving me a notice for the account closure, it feels like the deletion was done manually, I'm the only person with access to the account so not sure what exactly has happened.   


Anyway, luckily my assets aren't stored on Coinbase, I just use coinbase to buy crypto with. Problem is, I'm unable to provide statements for my tax report since the account got deleted. I haven't been able to find an E-mail adress or live chat support after scouting the internet for a while. Anybody able to point me into the right direction? Cheers!"

9/3/23,"Coinbase fiat withdraw not credited to my card after 3 weeks, Coinbase support won't provide ARN number."," I'm writing this post to share my frustrating experience with Coinbase's fiat withdrawal process. Three weeks ago, I initiated a withdrawal from my Coinbase account to my debit card. However, to this day, the funds have not been credited to my card. Whenever I contact support I keep getting the same automated response that everything on their end is fine, the transaction is completed and to contact my card provider regarding the issue..

So I did contacted my bank several times to inquire about the status of the transaction, and they confirmed that no transaction took place or is incoming. They asked me for the ARN number, which is a unique code provided by the sending bank for tracking purposes. 

I reached out to Coinbase's customer support to obtain the ARN number, but to my surprise, they have been unresponsive for the past week, I have sent multiple emails and support tickets regarding this number, but all I receive are automated responses stating that they will get back to me soon which never happens. However, without the ARN number, I can't provide my bank with any additional information to track the transaction. 

It's incredibly frustrating that I can't get any concrete information about the status of my withdrawal nor this ARN code so my card provider can actually take action. My bank has confirmed that no transaction has taken place... I have even provided Coinbase  with an unedited PDF Bank Statement as proof that I have not received the funds. 

 It's been three weeks, and I have no idea where my money is or when I will receive it. To make matters worse, Coinbase support is not helping me track the transaction by providing the ARN number which I've been asking for a week already.

Has anyone else experienced similar issues with Coinbase's withdrawal process or support? If so, how did you resolve the problem? Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated..."

Cheelee is a new generation social network - GameFi short video platform where users can earn money by watching the feed. 

WEBSITE: [https://cheelee.io/](https://cheelee.io/) 

**CHEEL TOKEN**

CHEEL is a governance token and has a limited emission of 1,000,000,000. CHEEL allows you to level up your NFT glasses. CHEEL token will be required for future features voting.

**WHY CHEEL TOKEN IS A GEM?**

* Entering the social media market gives Cheelee the access to a huge audience of potential users - 4.6 bln people. In comparison, the audience of crypto users is only 320M people. Due to the size of the market, Cheelee can provide a monthly escalating inflow of users for many years. This allows CHEEL to become a mass adoption token!
* CHEEL has already been made x90!
* CHEEL is listed on Coinsbit and BitMart.
* The estimate of competitors in the short videos platforms market  is more than $500 billion: Cheelee's growth potential will be at least $100 billion, CHEEL\`s price will grow by more than 1000 times!
* CHEEL Takes 1st Places in Top Media Crypto Ratings
* CHEEL\`s price is protected from panic sales and draining by investment funds. The funds and team tokens are frozen for two years, so while the project is going through a development phase, there will be no tokens in free circulation. The only exception is community drop: 3 years vesting, and 6% TGE. 

This smart solution will ensure the stability of the token exchange rate and the loyalty of investors who will benefit from holding CHEEL.

The vulnerability arises when Starknet apps ""obtain a stark\_key\_signature and/or api\_key\_signature"", and allows an attacker to place orders and perform unauthorised transactions. MPC wallets generate ""shards"" of a private key, with each shard held by a signer. These shards must be joined off-chain to produce a signature, meaning they do not require smart contracts or special blockchain protocols. Safeheron is working with Web3 app developers, including dYdX, Fireblocks, Fordefi, ZenGo and StarkWare, to patch the vulnerability. The company plans to make its protocol open source in mid-March.
