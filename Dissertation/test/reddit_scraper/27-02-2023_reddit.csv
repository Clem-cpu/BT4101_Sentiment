26/2/23,Congratulations to Solana for coming back online after being down for 21 hours,"Solana suffered another outage on February 25th, the network was down for 21 hours.

Users attempting to make a transaction on Solana received a message telling them ""sorry the internet is down""

Some Solana based projects promised giveaways once the network was back up to keep moral up I guess.

could you imagine people offering giveaways when bitcoin comes back up?

After coming back up some users took to twitter to celebrate about their beloved blockchain coming back up.

[other chains don't know what this feels like](https://preview.redd.it/trdr7zyn5gka1.png?width=391&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=19cf67b0f7fe70ec4792c60253ddf13244fe63c7)

Others seem to have already forgotten about the outage already, claiming it never happened.

After hours of investigating the incident they decided the best course of action was to try and restart the network, because that always seems to solve the problem. Solana Dev's are experts on getting a network to come back up.

Anybody here still invested in Solana?

TLDR:

Solana was down for 21 hours, crypto twitter experienced a multitude of emotions, Solana is now back up."
26/2/23,"Why crypto? Try living in a country where FIAT is a disaster and there is a 1,000,000 banknote that currently is 1 and it is only worth 4 cents (USD)","I'm Venezuelan living here that believes in crypto, why?

Because for years I am tired of the FIAT in my country, it has been a disaster for years. Some people from other subreddits blame and point me for calling me a ""crypto enthusiast"", it's easy saying that when your inflation rate is less than 10% yearly and your FIAT currency is accepted and respected worldwide (Maybe I would be like that too in that situation).

But for us, people living in countries with really bad economic management, something that cannot be controlled by a central bank is a win.

That banknote is ""old"" while still in circulation, its face value is ""1 millon"" which is 1,000,000 Bs. (Bolivares) but because six zeroes were removed by law more than a year ago, not it's 1 ""new"" Bs, they didn't bother creating a new banknote so it's just like that people should understand it says 1,000,000 but it is worth 1. Of course a lot of problems specially with old people. Government just doesn't care.

Exchange rate is 25 Bs. / USD, so 1 Bs. is around 4 cents. You need 25 of these to make 1 USD.

Monthly minimum wage is 130 Bs. so around 5 USD."
26/2/23,"The HEX community is mad at us for calling their project a scam and a ponzi - they discussed our posts and comments on Youtube, Twitter, and Reddit","Over the past 10 days, three posts were made that covered HEX. These posts each took a different angle but can be summarized as claiming that Hex is a scam and a ponzi, and that its founder Richard Heart is a known scammer.

You can find these posts on the subreddit if you wish. For those of you who do not know: HEX is a token on the Ethereum network that advertises itself as a way to earn 40% per year with “certificates of deposit.” It is heavily marketed in 'the real world',

# HEX community is mad

The HEX community did not appreciate these three posts. In fact, they actively discussed and brigaded these posts in several ways. For example:

* I got quite some direct messages through Reddit from ""enthusiastic HEX community members"" that were not so kind. I know others did too.
* They ensured that I got messages from RedditCareResources because they clicked “get them help and support” on my profile.
* They discussed and condemned these posts and the comments on these posts on all types of social media. Even the HEX YouTube shillers covered our comments.

I had to laugh because of this title though.

**Reddit**

They link every post and then go and downvote and reply. These posts later got deleted.

26/2/23,At Least 0.45% Of The World's Population Holds $1 Or More Worth Of Bitcoin. Analyzing Bitcoin's Address Distribution And Ownership At The Time Of Writing. Where Is All The Bitcoin Located?,"In this post I'll analyze the bitcoin's address distribution and ownership to see in which wallets (quantity wise) is located. The better the Bitcoin is distributed over all the wallets, the less power 'whales' will have. Also please take a note that the data is from BTC wallets, so users that store their BTC in centralized exchanges will have their BTC in the centralized exchanges hot wallet (where most of the time all the BTC is stored from all customers).

**Let's start with the address distribution with their BTC balances:**

&#x200B;

[Address distribution \(in BTC\) ](https://preview.redd.it/6lnf0g1u9jka1.png?width=540&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4916e2c08740b0b894c62ade14c3cd789aca3112)

There are only 4 wallets that have more than 100k BTC which is a significant amount. The circulating supply of BTC is 19,301,000.00, so each wallets have **at least** an ownership of **0.518% from the circulating supply.** 

**Now let's make the data more visible:**

&#x200B;

[A visible look of the Bitcoin distribution data](https://preview.redd.it/0fkth77hcjka1.png?width=421&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5f65dd2af8b7b5f171de414c90bb4a94034c814f)

In this graph we can conclude that the **most addresses** ***with BTC in*** **it have between 0.001 BTC and 0.0001 BTC.** The amount of zero balance addresses are 1,051,193,879 which is about 95% of all the Bitcoin wallet addresses. 

**If we look at the Bitcoin wallet addresses in USD:**

&#x200B;

[Bitcoin wallet address distribution in USD ](https://preview.redd.it/qug7ggqpejka1.png?width=539&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=89cdce28fedd90c1dacee40b0e492a54cc1c1440)

There are **67,481 Bitcoin millionaires** at the time of writing. And even 4,924 wallets have an equivalent of $10M! 

If we assume that there are **8,018,923,149 people on earth** and **36,456,341 Bitcoin wallets holds $1 or more worth in BTC,** then we can make a fair estimation that **0.45% of the world population holds at least $1 or more worth of BTC.** That's why I personally think that we're early! Also like I said at the top of the post, in this data the people that hold their BTC in CEX are not in these calculations because their BTC is in the CEX hot wallet. So we can say that **at least** **0.45%** of the world population holds **$1 or more worth of BTC.**

26/2/23,Spouses in divorce proceedings are using cryptocurrency to hide money.,
26/2/23,FTX Japan isn't actually letting everyone withdraw,"I see so many posts and news everywhere saying FTX japan is letting everyone withdraw. This is false, I  have a FTX Japan account and they are choosing who gets to withdraw. Liquid(SBF""s japanese crypto exchange) is the one who chooses who can claim their money.

None of my Japanese friends were able to withdraw as well. Apparently the funds between global and JP are actually mixed so not everyone gets their money back. This is worrying how some people get to withdraw first than others.... I am afraid that I will most likely be in a lawsuit against FTX japan for the next 10 years as well."
26/2/23,"""Legitimate"" Financial News Sites are No Better than r/cc","I just pushed through about 15 obnoxious ads at Forbes.com to read hype that would make r/cc blush along with deeply dubious speculation.  I don't think I learned anything substantive - inf act I think I am now dumber - and yet it was a really long article (maximize ad-invasions?).  Here are examples and at the end I pose a question for us.

They claim the fed has been behind every major price movement:

> The Fed's ultra-loose monetary policy since the beginning of the Covid pandemic that saw interest rates cut to effectively zero and trillions of dollars added to the Fed balance sheet helped propel the bitcoin price to a peak of almost $70,000 per bitcoin in 2021.  
>  
>As the Fed has hiked interest rates in an attempt to drive down inflation over the last 12 months the bitcoin price has collapsed to under $16,000, wiping around $2 trillion from the combined bitcoin, ethereum and crypto market.

&#x200B;

Then they make this ridiculous claim by quoting a ridiculous person.

>Earlier this month, Robert Kiyosaki, the author of financial advise book *Rich Dad Poor Dad* predicted a ""giant crash"" is coming for financial markets, with a ""depression possible"" that forces the Fed to ""print billions.""  
>  
>Kiyosaki said this scenario could push the bitcoin price to an eye-popping $500,000 per bitcoin. ""Why? Because faith in U.S. dollar, fake money, will be destroyed,"" Kiyosaki [posted](https://twitter.com/theRealKiyosaki/status/1624988584267894784) to Twitter.

The title for the article is sensational garbage as well.

26/2/23,"After “banning“ Crypto at $60k in 2021, China is now seemingly easing their ban. This could open the door for A LOT of money influx for Crypto.","We all have seen the news of Hong Kong unbanning Crypto and making Crypto trading fully legal now, which is indirectly also a decision by China or maybe even their first phase of making Crypto trading even legal on Mainland China. Why is this so good you ask? Well before China banned Crypto again and again, a lot of money form China was flowing into Crypto.

One example may be the BTC-CNY (Chinese Yuan) trading pair, which during the 2017 bull market was very very popular and many made a ton profits on so-called “arbitraging“ CNY with the USD pair, meaning to buy and sell BTC from CNY pair to USD pair to make exploit possible volatility between CNY-USD.

Now with Hong Kong back we can be damn sure that there will be BTC-CNY based stablecoins too soon, directly from HK. Even if Hong Kong and China are two different entities, their connection to each other has grown so big in the past years and months that Chinese retail money or even legislation will inevitably take part in this too.

Not to forget that many Crypto exchanges have their roots in China or Hong Kong, as Bitmex or even FTX. Even CZ himself was from the chinese OKCoin originally and left to build Binance. The connection of Crypto and China has always been huge, whether we like it or not. Now will see from June 1st onward, how this plays out…"

>Share my personal info with third parties for Advertising.

It can be found in Settings > Privacy. It is turned ON by default for new accounts.

Better to check and disable that shit.

In fact for all new signups best to check and disable this immediately, before the details can propagate. This is a serious problem (among many others) with KYC exchanges."
26/2/23,Will we ever get a bull run that is as massive as 2021?,"I was just thinking about the last bull run, and I've come to realize just how many things had to fall in place at the right time for it to happen. 

Covid catalyzed it by completely surprising us with how fast it spread. Which in turn made the FED print 3$ trillion to avoid a financial and a healthcare crisis. Do you have any idea how big that number is? that is one fifth of the dollar supply, and it was printed just in one year! People had so much funny money than to know what to do with and they put alot of it in Crypto. The market was worth 2.9$ Trillion (strangely close to the amount of money printed in 2020).

But with the economy heading towards a possible recession, the damage done by FTX on Crypto, and the regulations that will be enforced as a result; Do you think the halving of Bitcoin will be enough to make the Crypto market ever reach that high again?

Not Fuding, just looking for insight."

26/2/23,We just had the longest streak of profit-taking since the 2021 bull market. Showing how significant this rally to $25k actually was.,"While we are currently in a very crabbish period as we look at the price charts, this is exactly when we just zoom out and reflect how much of an impact this rally actually had. From $16k to over $25k, BTC had a over a 60% gain in just a bit more than a month. Still for many the levels of $16k and $25k may sound equally low but we have to look at the amount of healing that did for a market in a brutal bear market for over a year.

This can be seen through the net profits metric that is just calculated through, Realized Profit - Realized Losses. We have been in the are of net losses since the bear market started in about November of 2021, since then we only had minor days or even one full week of profit-taking.

&#x200B;

[Chart imported from glassnode](https://preview.redd.it/mpex7t6hskka1.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=60cd61860d6b14574cffe8f059ad5595c167c45c)

Here we can see that this is now finally over as we have been in the LONGEST streak of profit-taking since the very bull market in early November 2021 while we were hitting new ATHs. This period has now lasted for over 3 weeks and just shows that even with a rally that has not put us significantly above the lows of this bear market, it has given us some much-needed relief.

This should also be another reminder to enjoy the small things (while they last), such as our pump right now. We could have also been just crabbing at $15k still or even lower but we are not, we should be happy and grateful for that."

26/2/23,What will be your advice to a person who is getting into Crypto today?,"Here is my list. I would have liked to follow these a bit more religiously but nonetheless....

**1) Learn a bit about the Technology** \- how it works, why is it different, what it takes to build networks/Dapps ---- doesn't need to be a degree but basic reading over a few days/ weeks can give a lot of knowledge. Don't be a fool in the market.

**2) Know the right people to follow**. Having said that, there are 1000x more shady influencers/ people in Crypto. Founders/Heads of major projects, exchanges, services are generally good people to follow - you may not like them always, you may disagree with them but they would most likely not say hyper-stupid things or do super-shameless shilling. 

**3) Beware of shady scammers/ YouTubers** \- never ever follow their advice blindly. Most of the time they  are paid to shill or promote a project. Sometimes they have yoloed into something and they will try to rally everyone to invest, and there are numerous reasons but they are not here to make you smart and rich. You can blindly apply this to every Crypto YouTubers.

**4) The only way to be happy in Crypto sustainably is invest what you can afford to loose**. This is extremely hard to follow during market rallies/ FOMO cycles but always a good reminder. Basically, know your risk appetite really well, stick to it so you don't force yourself into intensive-stress-zones.

**5) Have the right perspective on corrections/ down-markets:** Even some of the best projects can crash 80%+ in Crypto during bad times. ETH crashed 85% from ATH, BTC crashed 80%, Solana crashed 95% and so on in the last crash cycle in 2022. Now, most of the time good projects bounce back and go higher than previous ATH but it's important to keep a perspective on the level of correction in mind to stay peaceful.

**6) It takes time, be patient** \- overnight mooning happens every once in a while in Crypto but they are rare and you need to be almost a witch-hunter to really get them, however, good news is that most good projects create massive value in long term. Patience and the right projects (utility, technology, people) are important if you are looking for big gains, don't sell them for loss just after one major down-rally/ bear-market.

Please add yours to this list - I can compile the final list and post/ update the post."
26/2/23,The US Government Will Never Ban Crypto. Here's Why,"Decentralized networks make outright bans impossible. But that won't stop US Agencies from raising the friction. A necessary step to gain control.

As a Web3 researcher, I'm afforded a deep look at what drives people who enter the space.

Researchers gain perspectives from:

* Start-up companies
* Legacy business
* Academics
* Procrastinating public functionaries & writers

Their motives are diverse; however, I've now carried out enough assignments to see an emerging trend, common to all.

This trend shows Govt actions from a different angle. And it's rather dark.

As of February 23, 2023, Bitcoin & Ethereum have cumulatively completed 2,691,440,324 transactions.

Blockchain transactions are detailed and immutable. The total 2.69B count confers their legitimacy to participants and non-participants alike.

This growing record is becoming history's deepest and most accurate metadata map ever created.

The value of the data will grow into the trillions.

US Govt actions have a single objective: *Manage access to blockchain metadata.*

Keeping it open and properly recorded is beyond important. All without gatekeepers."

I myself have collected Pokemon on and off again since its inception, and I seem to go through phases, intense ones much to the dismay of my poor wife, who hate collectibles, and calls crypto “fake money.”

Sometimes I’ll be heavy into collecting, and all over eBay chasing single cards or trying to snipe good deals on sealed product to keep sealed, and lock away for when it has increased in value, and I leave the crypto world behind. 

Other times, I’m into crypto and NFTs, and I stop buying cards. Currently, my mailbox hasn’t been filled with cards, and now my profile pic on Reddit has a cone on it. This bout of collector/investor addiction though, is strictly on the Reddit avatars which I’m bullish on, and I’m back to buying a little bit of my fav coins every paycheck with my allowance.

Here is a list of all the things that Moons can be used for:

* As a governance token to vote in polls
* Can be used to tip other Reddit users
* Can be traded on exchanges
* Can be used to purchase a premium membership on r/CryptoCurrency
* Can be used to purchase the banner on r/CryptoCurrency
* Can be used to host an AMA on r/CryptoCurrency
* Can be used to stake to provide liquidity on Sushiswap

I. **Rewards will be distributed through** [**Sushi in real time**](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1135fht/ccip051_pay_out_moon_rewards_to_owners_of/j96rgh2/) **and rewards will likely be displayed upfront.** Just like Moon users taking advantage of this - people not already in the Moon ecosystem will have to buy Moons with ETH in order to take advantage of the extra rewards from CCIP-051 rewards.

II. **Moon Rewards for Liquidity Providers will not impact your KM.** The Moon Rewards can be readded to liquidity or sold in full and you will not see any impact to your KM. 

III. **CCIP-051 rewards are in addition to Sushi rewards currently at 2.75% APR and trading fees earned from providing Liquidity.** This means by providing Liquidity you are eligible for three separate reward processes.  

IV. **A Bigger Liquidity Pool Means healthier and more stable Moons.** The larger the Pool the less impact any single Buy/Sell will have on Moons. As the size of the pool grows it becomes harder for any single entity to dramatically move the price with a buy/sell. 

\---------------------------

Before you provide Liquidity make sure you understand impermanent loss, ""essentially the total value of your assets losing value compared to just holding the two separate tokens"". For a simplified explanation you can read [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/11b6a6g/an_indepth_yet_simple_guide_to_help_you/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).  

If you want to provide liquidity on SushiSwap you can look at [this detailed guide](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1140y3e/the_complete_and_extensive_guide_for_getting_your/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for step by step instructions. 

^(Important: You will need to stake your liquidity tokens after providing liquidity to be eligible for Sushi rewards and CCIP-051 rewards.)

26/2/23,In 2017 rumors of Vitalik's death caused ETH to plummet 25% in a matter of hours,"... It was a year of 2017 ...a first bull market for Ethereum in which it had an impressive run from basically nothing to $1000. Somewhere towards the end of the bull run.. 25th june 2017 to be precise... a weird post on 4chan appeared. 

***“Vitalik Buterin confirmed dead. Insiders unloading ETH”***

The post also contained the photoshopped image of a supposed news article. Apparently, someone started spreading the news that Vitalik had died in a car crash back in 2017. And of course, the internet went crazy with it.

[This is google image search, the original post is ofc deleted \(this is the best I could find\)](https://preview.redd.it/9hh6hshdzjka1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=314868987faee8f5cf2a995f391b33cc5d94efea)

The post quickly gained traction, and within hours, it was  shared on other online forums and news media outlets. In a matter of hours ETH price plummeted from $300 to $230. Some users expressed their condolences, whilst others questioned the validity of the report. 

[Comments on the original post \(which is now deleted\)](https://preview.redd.it/k2itg0wjzjka1.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=85064b4533fd6d5e98b51043897e735feae5b873)

Despite the lack of any credible evidence to support the claim, the rumour continued to spread, fueled in part by the fact that Buterin had not been active on social media for a few days before the post. To make things worse, the crypto market had d a significant drop around that time, which some attributed inside trading of people who knew about Vitalik's death before the news. 

However, a few hours after the initial post, Vitalik himself took to Twitter to refute the rumours of his death: 

[\\""Proof of life\\""](https://preview.redd.it/7woieqjzzjka1.png?width=463&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=283f38564e66f3875ea16143734eee9a5c6c92c3)

Despite Vitalik's tweet, the rumours persisted for some time, with some even speculating that the Twitter account had been hacked.... Over time, the rumours eventually faded away, and ETH proceded to make new ATH 6 months later at \~$1450.

[ETH Price during 2017](https://preview.redd.it/th6fo5j2zjka1.png?width=917&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fee932f8219e9bbc506d6386e2d803fbb0d22b2d)

If Vitalik decided to step down for whatever reason today... do you think panic would ensue?  Would ETH have the same appeal without Vitalik?

26/2/23,"HSBC, 8th largest bank in the world, says it expects 5-10% of all global assets (~19.5T USD) to be tokenized on blockchains by 2030","HSBC has been slow to adopt blockchain and even outright *negative* on blockchains and cryptocurrency until 2022. In January 2023 they released a report with a partner, Northern Trust, estimating that 5-10% of all assets worldwide would be tokenized by 2030 - representing an enormous sum of about 19.5 trillion USD. [source](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/hsbc-northern-trust-tokenized-by-2030/ ) HSBC sees the role of banks in relation to blockchain as serving as trusted custodians, involved with custody of digital assets for their clients. While this certainly will need further definition, it’s fascinating that the world’s largest financial players are starting to see the power and inevitability of blockchain technology in finance - even in a bear market, even after SBF/FTX and countless crypto hacks and scams, even after Bitcoin has been declared dead again. The future of blockchain technology is global and it will become enmeshed with traditional finance, resulting in exponential growth of market caps. It’s hard to say exactly how we get there and what chains will be central to it all, but it’s clear that the big finance players are engaging with blockchain and won’t want to be left behind."
26/2/23,Bitcoin hit $1 USD for the first time in February 2011,"Just a PSA: on February 9th, 2011, Bitcoin hit $1 USD  for the first time - 2 years after its launch. It had already been declared dead once before this, at a price of $0.23 by “The Underground Economist,” and was well on its way to many more death declarations. Most of us here weren’t buying or mining BTC in 2011 - but imagine where it all began and the excitement miners would’ve felt at this huge milestone. We’ll eventually get through this bear market into crypto spring and start seeing rises again - feel our own versions of this excitement whether it’s through BTC, ETH, Reddit avatars, or another rising alt. We may not be early to crypto, but we’re not late, either. Remember to be smart with your money, avoid the fomo, and have an exit strategy for when the green candles return!"
26/2/23,What is the OKB token doing in the top 10?,"For the past few weeks OKB has been rallying and has set a new all time high despite the fact that we're not really in a bull market. According to Coingecko, right now it's in the 7th place. 

For the last few years, the top 10 coins have been the ones that are well established and known by many people even outside the crypto space. But OKB is clearly an exception since it's not very well known and isn't talked about much. 

So, what is OKB?

Apparently it's an exchange token belonging to the exchange OKX. I did a quick look and found out that the exchange is not even available in the US. And globally it isn't one of the biggest exchanges, judging by 24h volume and monthly visits. 

For comparison, here are other exchanges that are bigger and have their own tokens that have a smaller market cap:

Bitget (MC 570 million) 

Digifinex (MC unknown, the token is pretty much dead) 

Kucoin (MC 850 million)

Huobi (MC 850 million) 

Coinsbit (MC 47 million, the token seems completely dead and hasn't recovered at all during the recent Bitcoin rally) 

It's surprising how poorly other exchange tokens have performed, especially Digifinex and Coinsbit. They have been hit really hard by the bear market. 

But none of the competitors come even close to OKB which somehow has a market cap of 12 billion. 

What do you think is the reason? Seems like an exchange token like any other, it gives discounts on trading fees and some small benefits. In US it can only be obtained through other, smaller exchanges like Gate and Hotbit, but in those cases it can't be used for its utility. We know that US is pretty much the center of crypto, so the popularity of the token doesn't make any sense. Maybe there's something more going on under the radar that most people don't know about."
26/2/23,"Bitcoin is not just a technology, it is an economic transformation","Bitcoin isn't just a technological improvement like a smartphone, the internet, or just a new payment method. It’s a reinvention of money from the ground up and is different than any primitives.

Since Bitcoin has a fixed supply it can be used for measuring the value of every stock, property, business, or thing that exists on the earth is evaluated. This will cause Bitcoin to be the single most liquid and valuable “unit of value” on earth.

For sure this transformation and becoming globally adopted won't happen easily. It will face many, many headwinds and will be claimed dead. But it is impossible to stop changes once they started and we are already in the last period of the first generation's era, with new generations changes will get faster. This is the nature of paradigm shifts, most people don’t notice them, and even when they do, they rarely understand it."

Everyone has a reason they don't DCA weekly or monthly. Some prefer lump sum investments, maybe you decided to invest in something else, or you're waiting for another 10% drop. After a fall from 69k and as much potential as something like BTC has, what are the reasons you aren't buying? 

Everyone knows timing the market is a bad idea, yet so many people do it. You may even see a nice 10% dip, and then you just wait for another 10%, then miss your opportunity and buy higher.

26/2/23,When is the peak of a bullrun reached for you? And when do you plan to sell?,"I have started DCAing a while ago and plan to do so until somewhere between end of 2024 and mid 2025

I chose this timeframe as I think markets will peak around 6-12 months after the next btc halving. Next halving should be around

Adding calc here instead of actual date etc. as it may change over time:

At 840'000 blocks the next halving takes place. Take that number minus the current current block and then divide by 144 blocks which are approx. mined per day to get how many days are left till halving.

Of course that's all specullation with those 6-12months but still it gives me some kind of timeline which I need (want to stick to a plan and don't take emotional decisions).

I got my time frame on the horizon but I have no chance to actually time the market. That means I need some indicator which helps me to understand when to actually sell. There are many numbers I could take but I decided to do it differently.

I don't talk about crypto with a lot of people - there are only 2 friends of mine with which I exchange 1,2 word here and there if something special happens. I also don't talk to my family or co-workers about it.

During the last bullrun I noticed that there are some people around me that usually start talking about topics once they reach their ath. Crypto, NFTs, Stockmarket. But also colletibles, ""new technology"" or other opportunities. I noticed that it's usually the same people and understood once those people start talking about something it's at its peak and will tank. They are usually the first ""ahead"" of the time everyone starts talking about something but late for being""early"". That's why my indicator has been set to a list of 5 of those people. Once 3/5 will start talking about crypto during the next bullrun I will cash out.

there was a guy named Bob who was convinced he was going to get rich by investing in cryptocurrency. He spent hours reading Reddit threads, watching YouTube videos, and listening to podcasts about the latest altcoins and ICOs. He even joined a Telegram group where people shared tips on which coins to buy and sell.

Bob was so excited about the potential of cryptocurrency that he decided to invest all of his savings into various coins. He bought Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and even some obscure tokens that promised to revolutionize the world of online gaming.

At first, everything seemed to be going well. The value of his portfolio was skyrocketing, and Bob felt like a financial genius. He even started telling his friends and family about his new-found wealth, bragging about the Lamborghini he was going to buy once he cashed out.

**But then,** 

Disaster struck. The market took a turn for the worse, and Bob's portfolio began to plummet. Suddenly, his Lamborghini dreams seemed far-fetched, and he started to panic.

Desperate to salvage his investment, Bob turned to the Telegram group for advice. But instead of finding helpful tips, he found himself bombarded with messages from scammers and fraudsters trying to sell him on the latest pump-and-dump schemes.

In a moment of desperation, Bob even considered selling his car and using the money to buy more coins. But then he realized he had already sold his car to buy his initial investment.

**In the end,** 

Bob learned a valuable lesson about the risks of investing in cryptocurrency. He realized that sometimes, the best investment you can make is in yourself, your education, and your future. And, of course, in a reliable and trustworthy financial advisor.

It took some time if I'm being honest. Like most of us joke, I came in for the money but stayed for the technology. But truth be told, most of you reading this post have heavy bags including me.

But some of you don't care. Especially the Bitcoiners. They don't care about the fiat valuations given to Bitcoin. Those who are true believers only consider the entry point of importance rather than the selling point. 

Stocks are barely beating inflation. Gold has been stagnant and very hard to liquidate. Bonds can't even keep up with CPI. Real estate has a really high barrier of entry.

The more you read about macro, I'm actually glad I have a stake in an asset class that can't be inflated away to oblivion.

Maybe that's just my understanding. And not everyone will share the same. So tell me if you've had the ""Aha moment""? And what made you realise it?

Buy crypto at a lower price and then sell it when the price goes up. Yes, IT'S THAT EASY!!

&#x200B;

**Rule Nr. 2 - SCAM! SCAM! SCAM!**

There is no better, faster, stronger way to reach the crypto millionaire status, that's a fact! Scam people! Create an animal token or a ape related NFT, write a story about the project based on empty promises and real life utilities and pay influencers to advertise it for you. You know what comes next, don't you!? Just dump everything on the suckers and booom, YOU ARE A MILLIONAIRE!

&#x200B;

**Rule Nr. 3 - USE AS MUCH LEVERAGE AS YOU CAN**

By now you have probably heard people saying "" Avoid leverage, you'll get rekt!"". You know what I call those people? Brokies! What color is their bugatti?

&#x200B;

**Rule Nr. 4 - LOOK AT CHARTS 24/7**

Who needs to rest and sleep? Definitely not us crypto addicts! Say goodbye to that sad and depressive social life you already had anyways! Never turn off your computer, never close the 69 tabs you have for each chart and news channel and twitter pages. You never know when the next shiba token is dropping so, BE AWAKE!

&#x200B;

**Rule Nr. 5 - REPLACE RED CANDLES FOR GREEN ONES**

This is by far one of the most important rule! Avoid RED, runaway from that color like the SEC runs away from enforcing laws! If you look at red candles for more than 10 min a day, you will live as a brokie forever. That's scientifically proven by the Wall Street Bets Institute.

&#x200B;

**Rule Nr. 6 - USE FAMILY AND FRENS AS EXIT LIQUIDITY**

Imagine this scenario: You found this dead token, no volume, almost no liquidity, its literally a obvious rugpull that has been alive and now is dead. Bring it back from the dead, buy as much as you can of it, go and recommend to all your family members and friends, tell them its GUARANTEED RETURNS! Tell them whatever you need to, just make sure that they buy that token!!

Then you sell. Easy!

26/2/23,You bought at the top in 2020 / 2021 and the FUD now has you doubting yourself.,"If this is you its ok. If you are doubting yourself you didn't enter the space with  a long term mentality. The mindset of a successful investor should always be putting money in something you believe people are going to use and in a decade + this thing could be very beneficial to the world therefore its likely to increase in price ideally 10x and make me a lot of money. Oh, and I am also going to enjoy using it or consuming it myself.  This is something I have learned along the way and trust me I have taken my hard tumbles, falls and losses. We usually learn the hard way. I just know many are down financially and morally. If you are in this position you should slowly but steadily DCA your way back up so the next bull run in a few years not only helps you recover losses but your investment actually provides returns. 

Maybe leave reddit and crypto twitter for a minute. Ignore all the regulation, SEC and securities bullshit. Macro down, war, inflation, political BS etc. It's too much specially if you decided to invest more than you were comfortable losing. Its just a crappy feeling for yourself and your family. 

Stick to the core values of crypto. Decentralization. Projects with solid use cases. Fundamentals that are strong. Trust me when I say there are a handful of projects that have these qualities and I am not counting stable coins for this. SO you made bad choices. You are down bad. Your family, friend and co workers are like ""I told you it was a scam"". Rubbish! We know why we are here. The future of finance is undeniable. Blockchain will have a say in how financial transaction settle in the years to come. NFT's will open a gateway to art, music, and sports. DEFI will allow people to borrow without being discriminated and yield where banks dont allow you to. There will be a crypto store of value that will hold strong for a long long time. Web3 will allow users to own their identity and respect their privacy. Remittances should and will be fast, cheap and most importantly secure. 

There is a lot to be optimistic about and I didn't even list another 5 use cases I can think of for blockchain tech and what all these amazing devs have done and will continue to build. 

Back t the first paragraph. If you came in here for quick return I am very sorry for your luck. If you didn't I implore you to change your outlook to 2030 and beyond. Regardless of your age. This is for you that entered the space in 2020 or 2021. Trust me. You are going to feel a lot better about yourself and will live your life with less stress and look at charts a lot less."

26/2/23,Colombia’s legal system experiments in the metaverse: Report,
26/2/23,"Will Bitcoin remain as the crypto equivalent of gold as a storage of value or will another cryptocurrency rise up to replace it, such as Ethereum?","As the title says, do you think Bitcoin will still be the crypto equivalent of gold in say, 10\~25 years, or do you reckon another cryptocurrency replace it?

We all know that Bitcoin being one of the first cryptocurrency tokens is currently viewed as the gold of crypto. However, bitcoin has a few problems, such as transaction fees and speeds. It is not viewed as a token that can be used for daily transactions due to those issues. As such, people like to view bitcoin as more like gold. And bitcoin is the market mover for cryptocurrency. Whenever bitcoin goes up, so do altcoins and vice versa.

What makes gold so valuable in the first place? A few reasons as listed here:

* Gold is perceived as a symbol of wealth, power, and majesty.
* Gold has had an exalted position throughout the ages as a highly coveted, even worshipped material.
* Gold has been used over millennia as jewelry and a means of exchange.
* Gold has an important economic role as a means of exchange should currency collapse.
* Gold is a store of value and thus an investment opportunity for individuals.
* Gold is rare and difficult to extract.
* Gold is malleable and can be formed as needed for use in, among others, electronics, dentistry, medical tools, and the defense, aerospace, and automotive industries.
* Gold is durable and noncorrosive.
* Gold has visual beauty and magnetic appeal.

The arguments for and against bitcoin can be as follows:

1) Bitcoin can be perceived as a symbol of wealth.

2) Bitcoin is not really exalted or worshipped since it is a digital token. Furthermore, there is a growing consensus that bitcoin mining is harmful, since it requires so much electricity.

3) Bitcoin is a new invention(technology). It is used as a means of exchange, though.

4) Bitcoin is a store of value and thus is a good investment opportunity.

5) Bitcoin is rare and hard to mine.

6) Bitcoin unfortunately, has no real-world use. You can say it is decentralised and hard to trace, but recently, we have seen that bitcoin transactions can be traced to wallets, although the wallet holders still remain anonymous. Furthermore, whales hold 11% of the bitcoin supply.(including exchanges and big companies). So it is not as decentralised as we thought.

7) Bitcoin is durable.

8) Bitcoin has no physical aspect to pull attention.

Does another cryptocurrency token have more of these features and as such, have a better chance of knocking bitcoin off its throne? Or are cryptocurrencies really just digital speculations that have no actual value and are just valued in the eye of the beholder. What do you reckon?"
26/2/23,How do you feel about the Wormhole hacker getting exploited to return the funds that were stolen?,"Some of you will remember the $140M hack on Wormhole last year, i was wondering if any of you were at all concerned with the details of it. Obviously its great for Jump to get their 120k ETH back but it was kind of alarming how it was done.

Basically the hacker had taken some derivates positions on Maker with the stolen ETH and used Oasis to manage liquidation risk. Oasis allowed Jump to use the admin multisig keys to upgrade a contract and pay the debt and returning the collateral.

Its worth noting that Oasis has this on their page:

>**Can Oasis access the funds in my account or wallet?**
No. With Dai, you - and only you - have access and control over your Dai. Dai uses blockchain technology to ensure the highest level of trust and transparency, and because of the way blockchain technology works, you ultimately get to decide just how secure you want it to be. This does mean you are your own security ultimately, so it is very important you keep access to your Dai and Oasis account secure.

This doesnt feel entirely true if by court order they can backdoor you, kind of a meme take on decentralization. Admin multisig keys are a sketchy concept sometimes. What do you guys think about the legal precedent being set here as well as vulnerabilities in protocols like this?"

With those caveats, what would it take for you personally to believe that the time of the bear market is over, and it's not just a small upswing? Maybe a certain number of weeks in a row of positive numbers? Would it take BTC and/or ETH reaching new ATHs? Maybe it's something a little harder to pin down like public confidence. It's hard to put much faith in something so silly, but when mainstream celebrities were making commercials for crypto, that did seem like the public was ready to hear the message.

26/2/23,The US Economy: Recession or Recovery?,"# Is the US in a recession or not?

This is the question that everyone wants an answer to, as a recession could have a significant impact on the markets. Central banks have said that technically the US is not in a recession, but the yield curve, a key indicator of a recession, is currently showing the biggest inversion in 40 years. Additionally, the US housing market has seen a 31-month low in January, and the US Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index is at its lowest level since May 2020.

While the Federal Reserve is reporting a strong labor market, spikes in US job cuts and banks boosting aggregate limits on credit cards to a record $4.4 trillion in Q4 2022 suggest that a recession could be on the horizon. However, US economic indicators show that the country is not yet in a recessionary phase, with financial conditions, consumer confidence, and employment still being reported as strong. For a recession to be deemed official, there will need to be more pain in these areas of the economy. It remains to be seen how much longer the FED can continue with their interest rate hikes before causing further pain.

The US economy seems to be in a precarious position and it remains to be seen whether a recession will occur in 2023.

&#x200B;

# If there is recession ahead, will Bitcoin outperform the market? 

Bitcoin, born out of the 2008 financial crisis, it has never faced a prolonged recession. In contrast, gold has traditionally acted as a store of value during such times.

👉 The question now is can Bitcoin finally get the store value narrative or if it will continue to be swayed by its correlation with stock indexes like the S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100. If the latter scenario occurs, Bitcoin's bottom may not be reached.

Despite on-chain and technical indicators suggesting the bottom was likely reached in November and a promising 2023 lies ahead, stock indexes may still fall. However, Bitcoin has the potential to operate independently and flourish leading up to its halving in 2024.

Macro Economist Lynn Alden predicts that gold and Bitcoin will outperform the market during an extended period of inflation. She anticipates their ability to provide upside in such an environment, but warns that **Bitcoin is subject to Fed dependence** in the interim. Alden advises traders to be aware of liquidity risks in the latter half of 2023, while also noting that Bitcoin offers a deep value accumulation zone for the next three to five years.

&#x200B;

 TL;DR: The US economy is currently in a precarious position with indicators showing potential recession, but official recessionary phase not reached yet. Bitcoin and gold are considered as potential options to outperform the market during an inflationary period, but Bitcoin's store value narrative is yet to be seen."
26/2/23,The ABSURDITY of the SECs view on airdrops (and subreddit community tokens?),"As I, like many other r/cc long-time lurkers, received my first r/cc token distribution this past week, I began to look into the tax implications.  

I came upon this article and many others like it: [medium.com/broctagongroup/demystifying-sec-order-on-airdrops-52b3fed8bc47](https://medium.com/broctagongroup/demystifying-sec-order-on-airdrops-52b3fed8bc47)

“The key reason why airdrops are considered to be a sale of securities is that the tokens themselves are considered securities. What constitutes a security differs from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. So long as the token itself is not considered a security in a particular jurisdiction, the airdrop should be legal. Hence, issuers may be able to continue to use airdrops to spread awareness about their projects in most non-US jurisdictions as long as the tokens themselves are not considered a security in a particular jurisdiction.”

If tokens are used as a means for the r/cc subreddit to generate revenue through banner ads, the Howey Test then comes into play.  This is an incredibly gray area, but for the sake of this post I will assume that in the eyes of the SEC that community tokens are a security.

Under that premise, upon receiving a distribution, the recipient would be liable to owe tax on the received token based on the spot price.  The absurdity begins there…

Our subs token has a 24hr volume of ~$43,000 based on my quick googling.  r/ethtrader and r/fortnitebr community tokens even less!

For a top contributor that has earned several thousand tokens, they’d be expected to owe tax on the spot price of $0.18 despite the fact that their sell pressure would cause a significant drop in price due to the low liquidity.

I truly feel that this needs to gain attention!"
26/2/23,Everything you need to know about Ethereum’s Shanghai hard fork and why it matters,
26/2/23,so are you buying the dip? or are you still waiting?,"This right here is a valid question.

As Bitcoin maintains its position above 23,000, the odds of it going back down seems like it could be anybody's game. When the FED raises rates I know we're going to dip more, but the question is how far and will it be an opportunity for a good swing trade or dca, or will it be an opportunity to get wrecked?

Personally I don't think we are ever going to get past 15,000 Bitcoin so at this point my prediction is that it's going to be a good swing trade wherever we go in regards to the price. 

With that said I'm going to wait until the FED raises interest rates I'm going to buy the dip I'm going to wait and see what happens and hopefully it's going to be a great swing trade if not you guys know what's going to happen with my fate and I'm also thinking about leveraging this trade what about you guys what do you think what is your plan?"

It is evident to see that if the market cycle bottom for BTC IS in fact in, then the **total crypto market cap** has held up significantly better than in previous cycles. I would suspect this is due to loyalty being divided among so many different projects now, thus the total MC is not as reliant on BTC itself. 

**I found it interesting as well, that the total MC bottom for crypto does not directly correlate with the bottom of BTC, and many other projects (which happened during the FTX black swan in November 2022), instead the total market cap bottom actually came much later, in January.**"
26/2/23,"A topic I don’t see discussed on here often, CBDC’s","Good morning crypto world. I browse this sub more than I care to admit. Something I rarely see brought up are CBDCs. 

- Central Bank Digital Currencies

Let me start out by saying that I’m not quite sure how I feel about them. I’m not here to shill them. I’m here to hopefully get a better understanding of what they are and what they mean to the world of bitcoin and cryptocurrency. 

As defined by a simple google search: 

Like existing forms of money, a CBDC would enable the general public to make digital payments. As a liability of the Federal Reserve, however, a CBDC would be the safest digital asset available to the general public, with no associated credit or liquidity risk.

As of 2022, countries with CBDC are below or around ten. Examples of countries with CBDC initiatives include the following. Examples include the Sand Dollar by the the Central Bank of the Bahamas, the Naira in Nigeria, the Digital Rupee launched by the Reserve bank of India, and the Digital Ruble by the Bank of Russia.

What are your thoughts on CBDCs and what they mean to us investors in the crypto world? 

We could all use a little hopium so I’m going to end this post with saying I believe this CBDC push is another sign we are still early to this financial revolution. 

Thanks for taking the time to read and hopefully contribute to this conversation."
25/2/23,Crypto Regulations,"Hello Everyone,

I recently read a news article about bipartisan support for a potential crypto bill since the collapse of FTX.

It seems to me that the FTX meltdown is being used as the catalyst by lawmakers to regulate crypto. Discussions about regulating crypto are nothing new and you can go down the rabbit hole of news articles, Reddit, and Twitter posts that date back years. 

There is also the legal battle between Rippe and the SEC. The lawsuit is still ongoing and the outcome could have a negative impact on the broader crypto market (e.g., crypto is considered a security).

This brings me to my question, will you step away from the crypto market if regulation and/or crypto being considered a security becomes a reality? 

I find it interesting that some celebrate El Salvador for adopting Bitcoin as legal tender, but frown on any checks and balances that could prevent another FTX fiasco. 

Please don't downvote the messenger, just interested in what others plan on doing when the inevitable occurs. Thanks!"

26/2/23,Ethereum developers plan to create a new test network called Holesky.,"Core Ethereum developers are planning to build a new test network called Holesky, which will solve the problem of distributing test tokens to developers currently using the Goerli test network.

In a tweet on February 23rd, Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko said that developers are planning the new Holli test network for later this year. The network may be renamed to ""Holesky.""

The new test network has become necessary because the Goerli testnet tokens, which are meant to be worthless, have been given a monetary value. This makes it difficult for developers to use the testnet for free as intended.

Testnets are crucial for the development of Ethereum. Developers use them to test applications, updates, and software before they are deployed on the main network.

[https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1628822626130087936?s=20](https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1628822626130087936?s=20)

**Goerli test network**

While Ethereum has several test networks, Goerli is one of the most crucial because it is the first native multiclient test network. This means that many active developers use it for their work.

Developers have had significantly difficult experiences in the test network due to the token distribution model. Beiko said that the GoETH distribution methods have become less reliable, leading to the current problems.

Currently, only a few validators are responsible for distributing tokens, which are mainly distributed through faucets.

However, the limited distribution has led to a few holders hoarding testnet tokens, limiting the supply for developers who need tokens to test their applications on the network.

&#x200B;

**LayerZero's market for GoETH is facing criticism from the community**

To solve this problem, LayerZero Labs launched a test bridge that allows developers to exchange ETH for GoETH at $0.10. The company claimed that developers would no longer have to wait for faucet providers and described the bridge as a public good.

But some people believe that the testnet bridge has ultimately created a market for GoETH hoarders to sell. This could further encourage scalpers and exacerbate availability problems for developers who need tokens.

[https://twitter.com/LayerZero\_Labs/status/1628062799971897345?s=20](https://twitter.com/LayerZero_Labs/status/1628062799971897345?s=20)

Darpit Rangari, a smart contract developer, pointed out that assigning real-world value to testnet ETH is contradictory to the fundamental definition of a testnet token. Therefore, Rangari questioned whether this is an effective way for a fair distribution of testnet tokens.

Simon Harman, the founder of Chainflip, said:

""It only encourages more faucet vultures to drain testnet tokens for personal gain, ultimately ending Goerli's profitability as a testnet. Even if it is painful, gETH needs to remain worthless."""

Goals like ""becoming  rich"", ""buying a home"", ""going for holidays"" or ""getting financial freedom"" are not precise enough to be goals, they are just wishes that can mean anything depending on your mood or market situation.

If you want to save for home with crypto, check your needs, average prices and then write  a goal for example: ""I want to buy 120 m2 house in my city, which will cost $250-300k"" , if you want go for holidays thanks to crypto your goal should be something like:  ""when BTC will reach $60k I will sell 20% of my bag and will be able to take my wife and kids for 14 days holidays in Spain"". Clearly set goals let you not FOMO when market dump or pump. If bullmarket will start and new ATH will come selling part of your bag when everything pump and everyone else buy will be buying will be very hard for you. But don't let emotions and greed win, you should be investor not a gambler. If now you will use your brain to make cold calculations,  you won't need to follow your heart  advices in the future.


Ofc goals don't need to be final, since many people don't actually need anything in particular. If you have very good job, house, car and family, then:  ""I will DCA 10% of my salary into BTC for 3 next years and then decide what to do"" is also precise enough goal. But again all depend from your living situation, some people can afford more risk. Generally worse your living situation is more precise your goals should be, cause even small pump or dump will make you react emotionally.

Let's say you invested and bought 1BTC for $20k, your goal is to make money on it. But how big money exactly? How long you plan to hold, how much you will sell, at what prices etc. You may think you will decide later but it is exactly what you should never do. That's how people end up losing money. Either they sell after small pump or they hold too long cause they see everything is pumping and greed kicks in. Try to make your own list, your short and long term plans related to crypto: How much you invested, how much more you plan to invest in future or maybe how much you will DCA monthly, when and for what you will sell, in what reinvest profits, what things you want to buy after having profits, what things you shouldn't waste your money on, what are your price goals, how much at what price you need to sell to achieve you goal"". That's a lot of questions most people never ask themselves. You should ask them and write them down. Then you will have no excuses or dilemmas in the future."
26/2/23,"Could decentralized blockchain mitigate the corruption, bribery, violence and cronery seen in the election in Nigeria following the forced introduction of the Nigerian CBDC, e-Naira? The election is the biggest democratic event in Africa with 87 million eligible people to vote. Here's my view on it.","The election in Nigeria already has the potential to see decriminalization of non-CBDC crypto as Nigerians have fought back hard at the governments attempts to remove physical fiat (the Naira) and force the e-Naira upon the population.

It's the closest election since multi-party democracy was reintroduced in Nigeria replaced the military rule in 1999.

The election has a number of issues that could be solved or at least mitigated with blockchain, such as: 

* The dangers of voting (in Lagos, voters were attacked or coerced into voting for a particular candidate and ballot boxes were snatched which is another issue blockchain could help mitigate)
* Vote-buying and physical currency shortage (see quote below, I believe that blockchain could solve the currency shortage by replacing the big failure that the e-Naira turned out to be)

>The lead-up to the polls was overshadowed by a cash shortage caused by a botched attempt to redesign the currency, leading to widespread chaos at banks and cash machines as desperate people sought access to their money.  
>  
>The new notes were introduced in order to tackle inflation, and also vote-buying. On the eve of the election a member of the House of Representatives was arrested with almost $500,000 (£419,000) in cash, and a list of people he was supposed to give it to, police say.

26/2/23,Maximalism and the dumb rivalries in crypto.,"Let me start by saying this is not an attack on any particular community or crypto. Its simply my perception of how the maxi views the crypto world that surrounds them. Not justifying the behavior or mentality but it is definitely worth analyzing and discussing.

Bottom line is that maximalism is bad. Its ok to support and proudly display or talk about your beliefs but its also important and valuable to be respectful and understanding of others points of views. Its understandable that something like a crypto project can bring up passions and tensions specially when life changing money could be involved and here is the crux of it all. Your token is standing in the way of my token mooning or having  a better market cap than mine therefore your are disrupting the dreams of my bags pumping and getting full. Its pretty simple when you think about it.  

For example if you look at it from the eyes of a Bitcoiner its easy to understand how they align with the mentality that BTC is the only form of digital money that should exist.  Currently the crypto market cap is a tad above $1 trillion. BTC pretty much dominated about $450B. Their latest fantasy is that Bitcoin is not a crypto and all crypto should be deemed a security by the SEC specially Ethereum which holds the 2nd largest market cap at $200B. So Bitcoiner is thinking eliminate them all and we want all of that market cap to belong to us. Its simply greed, fear and feeling threatened.  Now I don't agree with this because whether we like it or not there are 22,600 crypto projects with thousands more to come. What utility they have is irrelevant for this post. What matters to the maxi is that its taking investors money that should ""rightfully"" go towards my maxi coin. Well guess what? Everyone and anyone has a right to create a blockchain project with a coin or token.  

It's like the Ford vs Chevy rivalry. Coke vs Pepsi. Apple vs Android and so on. All these projects with their tribalism throw shit at each other in hopes that their enemy perishes therefore VC's and retail would then invest in their coin. I will leave you with some of the dumb rivalries I see happening on reddit, crypto twitter, discords, podcasts and you tube.  None of these will lead to anything positive. The sooner crypto gets its act together and decides to unite against unfair regulation the better off we will all be specially as regulators are finally preparing to hack down on many if not all things crypto. Not a good time to be divided. More importantly it is of the essence that politicians, media and regulators do not see crypto communities divided. That is what we currently are but I get it. Greed is the root of all evil.

26/2/23,DCA in / DCA out. I mean for real this time!!!,"I track all of my transactions in coin market cap. It’s a record I can use for taxes… and to try and keep myself honest for any stupid decisions I’ve made. 

With the recent green days, I was thinking back to early 2021. Crypto was booming, I was in the game. I was making sick gains in Defi for like $40/day. Non-coiners couldn’t understand, so I didn’t try to explain how I was making money in things like pancakeswap or pancake bunny. (Was a real thing for you new peeps)

I’d discovered beefy finance, their boost pools, where you’d get bonus free tokens for up and coming “gems” like moonpots, dodo, Merlin or happiness token. All the price ever did was go up. Why should I sell anything?  I took my free tokens and often bought more. I was the smartest person alive. 

Then May and June hit. These shitcoins went to shit. I kicked myself for not selling more, swore I’d do better if things rebounded and I got another chance.  Summer turned to fall, crypto rallied to another new all time high. Bitcoin was back in the 60s… plan B and the experts were calling for 100-300k… “Super Cycle!” or “this time is different!” was said every day here. So, obviously I bought more. 

I’ve been looking at my ledger of past transactions. Tokens I’ve held that have basically evaporated in value.  I like to tell myself that I bought an education. Check on me in a few years to see if that’s true. I’ve bought through the dip. Bags are packed and I’m ready to go again. 

I’ll say this though. All of us are influenced by fear and greed; all of us have a little “gamble” inside. So, use the current time to make plans. Set some goals. Write it down. Stick to that shit. 

You’re not going to time the top, but you can DCA in and DCA out. Take some profits, especially on alt coins.  Don’t sell everything… but FFS sell some of it. Once the bull run sets in, our ability to think rationally will diminish.  

When you look at your ledger of worthless shitcoins in 2027, you’ll laugh a little easier if you took some profits along the way.

26/2/23,For those adding liquidity - this error/bug will likely happen to you,"If you are looking to add ETH/MOON liquidity on SushiSwap to earn extra MOONs, this means that after adding liquidity you must stake your Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens to earn SUSHI and MOON.  Currently you only get SUSHI, they are working on adding MOON rewards.  After you stake you can claim rewards any time by clicking the ""Claim Rewards"" button or you get them when you unstake the LP tokens.

HOWEVER, if you try to claim rewards or unstake LP tokens, SushiSwap will try to 'harvest' your rewards and if that wallet (reset daily I believe) doesn't have enough to pay you, then you get this weird set of messages below - a success message and a failure/error.

**You might freak out because it says ""successfully claimed rewards"" but nothing showed up in your wallet.  That message is a bug.**  You will see your rewards total hasn't changed.  Right now this happens when trying to harvest SUSHI and will also happen with MOONs.

THE SOLUTION?  Come back later.  The wallet will get refreshed.  You only get your rewards if the balance changes.  The failure will not hurt you.  The funds are SAFU.

Further annoying is you can't unstake LP tokens when this is happening.

&#x200B;

UPDATE: u/Maxx3141 pointed out this can also be due to gas fees and SushiSwap not estimating correctly.  Increasing gas amount may help.

26/2/23,"Crypto, regulation and its current challenge to the fiat system","In the past few weeks there seems to be a bit of an increase in talk from EU/US institutions, govenments & important financial people about stronger regulating or even banning Crypto (some recent examples: [\[1\]](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/02/charlie-munger-us-should-ban-cryptocurrencies.html), [\[2\]](https://cointelegraph.com/news/u-s-treasury-janet-yellen-calls-for-strong-regulatory-framework-for-crypto-activities), [\[3\]](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/01/30/bitcoin-suisse-chairman-says-eu-wont-ban-crypto-but-it-may-seek-to-contain-it/)). This type of news is not new and as we know Crypto is banned on and off in some countries (e.g. China, India). 

But I can't help feeling it is a bit different as this type of talk is now coming countries that have strong currencies themselves (like dollar/euros). This suggests that Crypto is having an impact on these financial systems. Also the observation that important financial people are starting to call out for a ban recently (e.g. Charlie Munger [\[1\]](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/02/charlie-munger-us-should-ban-cryptocurrencies.html)), might suggest that they are late to the game and rather see it suppressed or gone to keep their own financial position (in dollars/euros/gold/stocks) secure. 

Many Cryptos are decentralized and cannot be shutdown easily, so the blockchains themselves are pretty secure. This made me think of how Crypto could be regulated or even banned by institutes or governments on a worldwide scale. I guess one way would be to make centralized exchanges (CEX) illegal or forbid transfer of fiat money in/out of these exchanges (so basically regulating bank transfers and not the Crypto itself). This would make Cyrpto harder to access and less interesting for the average person (Crypto could still be used but it becomes hard/impossible to transfer your wealth back to fiat).

I am curious how you guys see this. Is this just the next crypto trash talk, or is the current economic situation (e.g. inflation etc) making crypto indeed a serious challenger to the fiat system. Also, what do you think about potential ways Crypto can be regulated and how effective such actions would be."
26/2/23,"An Quick Guide on the Primary Corporation That Funded BTC Dev, Starting 2014","This doesn't mean I support any of the forks either. I don't.

It's important to understand that the primary corporate entity which pushed the narrative that won the day, was founded and funded by some pretty nefarious people. These people were the \*seed capital\* - that is, the original monetary inputs which were used to start the company.

Twice now, the masses tried to adopt Bitcoin and couldn't. The incremental cost to upgrade nodes was vastly overshadowed by extra fees paid to miners instead. And LN at (appx) $200 per channel is not an answer. I can't drop my life savings into an LN channel. 

Besides which, dynamic blocks are needed just to facilitate onboarding and prevent a Flood & Loot of LN anyways. 

But I do wish to leave with something positive. If BTC merely adopted dynamic blocks, I would probably support it again. Until then, all that's happening there, is buying time for govts to push out their CBDCs, while Bitcoin continues failing to be useful as global money.

But this actually is very typical for post-bottom rallies.,"The most metric here is to probably know when how much of the holdings from all kind of investors are being spend because at the end of the day this spending is what creates any price metric that we know. For those spent coins, we can split them into two groups: Old Coins (held longer than 6 months) and Young coins (held for shorter than 6 months).

This metric does show exactly that, a spike in this graph means that large portions of the supply are realizing profits, both old and young coins. The black line shows the ration between old and young coins being spend. Right now we can see that this ratio is large but there are also nearly no coins being spend. Especially the spending power by older coins is nearly non-existent at “just“ 10k BTC over one week.

Here we have another metric that could show us what this low-spending could actually mean:

The Accumulation Trend Score has just flashed 0, which means that no coins are being bought right now but rather distributed, this is nothing unusual though.

The chart also shows that the case was the same during those market areas and each happened just after forming a bottom, we even had a 0 score last year after we dropped to $18k but the FTX black swan event obviously caused us to drop even further. So this is actually confirms that we have the bottom behind us and are moving forward."

Seychelles-based crypto exchanges Huobi and KuCoin have so far failed to take steps to block Russian banks from their platforms despite sanctions, Politico reported on Saturday, citing blockchain analytics firm Inca.

According to the report, both still allow traders to transact with cards issued by sanctioned Russian banks on their peer-to-peer platforms, including the country’s largest lender Sber Bank. According to Inca CEO Adam Zarazinski, allowing crypto buyers trade with each other using accounts at sanctioned banks is a “direct violation of US and European sanctions with a little bit of a loophole.” Neither Huobi nor KuCoin have so far commented on the report.

US policymakers have long accused the crypto industry of being one of the instruments for sanctioned Russians to bypass restrictions. Inca’s report also pointed to potential vulnerabilities in two other major exchanges, Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency trading platform, and Singapore-based ByBit, which allegedly offer Russians “many ways” to convert Russian rubles into cryptocurrency.

“Many exchanges officially curtailed their operations in Russia due to the imposed sanctions. They claimed to block users from Russia and to prevent them from opening new accounts,” the report states, noting that instead, most of them continued to work with Russian citizens, including allowing them to use the maximum deposit, trading, and withdrawal limits.

Binance slammed the report as “categorically false” in a statement later on Friday.

Binance is a full-KYC [know your customer] platform and was the first major exchange to implement EU crypto-related sanctions… [It] takes the extraordinary additional step of filtering any forms of communication between users to ensure there is absolutely no potential nexus with Russian entities through any sort of workaround,” Binance’s global head of sanctions Chagri Poyraz was cited as saying.

On Friday, the US Treasury revealed that sanctions target more than 80% of Russia’s banking sector in asset value. It also expanded sanctions against 11 more Russian banks, including Moscow Credit Bank, Uralsib Bank, MTS Bank, Zenit Bank and Bank St. Petersburg. The EU introduced similar measures over the past year, and imposed a sweeping ban on providing crypto services to Russians as part of its eighth round of sanctions, approved in October. Following the move, several major platforms banned access for Russians, including Canadian NFT-marketplace Dapper, Swiss company YouHodler, wallet Cryptopay and Finnish exchange LocalBitcoins."

As per [CCIP-051](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1135fht/ccip051_pay_out_moon_rewards_to_owners_of/), users can now take the Sushiswap ETH:Moons Liquidity Pool tokens and stake them with Sushiswap, earning rewards in both $Sushi and $Moons.  

Sushi helpfully developed a small smart contract for us that handles this, and as laid out in CCIP-051, any leftover Moons from the Moderator Distributions will be sent to a smart contract, which will then be distributed to users that have staked their LP tokens.  

For a guide on how to do this, please go to [this page](https://www.sushi.com/earn/arb-nova:0xd6c821b282531868721b41badca1f1ce471f43c5), connect your wallet (Via Metamask is easiest) and then follow the quick guide I've created here:

##[Staking Guide](https://imgur.com/a/Wg8cjKN)

**For any more in-depth questions, please ask on this post and someone helpful from our community will be along. If you find them helpful, please do upvote them and we can see Moons working in action - users rewarded for providing good, helpful content that benefits the subreddit.**  

We will be adding the Moons to the smart contract soon, where 1/28th will be sent out every day to holders of staked LP tokens. Therefore you cannot game the system by adding liquidity one day and removing it the next.  

Thank you!"

26/2/23,For those who might need to hear this,"**I typed this up in a comment to yet another post about how** ***“it’s ok if you screwed up, you’ll do better next time because of… reasons \*hugs\*”*** **but it got a bit long so here it is as a post:**

Simply believing and having a longer term mentality don't guarantee anything. Once you acknowledge that, you might be able to improve your circumstances next time.

If you really want investing in crypto and stocks to be a major part of your life in a successful manner, educate yourself. Learn everything until there is nothing left to learn and then educate yourself further. Repeat this for the rest of your life, because nobody can know everything about global markets and things change constantly in subtle ways through global variables such as changes in institutional policies or shifting perspectives around the environment and technology.

Seek facts, comb through history to see what strategies were used to wrongfoot the masses. Keep beliefs and opinions of others out of it. This is why the herd says ""TA is voodoo"" and ""nobody knows fuck about shit"", they're waiting for Elon, or JPow, or their dumbass friends or coworkers to tell them when and what to buy because that's the easy way out, and the majority are lazy and incompetent because they do the easy things like everyone else. Even beginner-friendly, easy-to-look-at TA techniques (candlestick patterns for example) are often used in a deceptive manner and the greatest fakeouts occur immediately after golden and death crosses before price action plays out in the direction those lagging data indicators couldn’t help but reveal through passing data points.

This where some people might counter with “just DCA then”. Look around, have you seen all the posts of people who DCA’ed in for years and still didn’t know how to take profits at the bull market highs? They couldn’t see that we were in a distribution phase at that time and that all phases are just revolving markups and markdowns because everybody was saying we're going to the moon and they can't help but be part of the herd. Buy low and high and sell never, I guess.

You will be wrong many times, and you can choose to learn from it all every time or dismiss it as ""nobody knows fuck about shit, why should I bother with this"". Nothing that will help you succeed will be easy or quick.

Reading reddit/twitter posts and watching youtube news and TA vids so that you can parrot what the rest of the herd thinks isn't education. In fact, that's the quickest way to become influenced in all the wrong ways which is why greed runs high at tops and fear runs high at bottoms. The media has *always* been used this way, even beyond the days of your great-granddaddy. Whenever you see people asking ""Who do you trust?"", they're really just asking ""Who can I blindly follow?"" whether they know it or not. Don't trust. See for yourself.

Having belief in the projects you buy into is sentimentally nice, but is not a path to success. You can buy absolute shitcoins (excluding things that could be rugpulled, read the whitepaper) and be successful if you have a general understanding of how the global markets deceive and move. You can also buy projects you believe in because of ""research"" only to realise in the end that it was all media manipulation and comfort knowing the herd agrees with your beliefs because they were also fooled.

I know that most people who read through this won't like any of it, and I'm not sorry. There might be a few who needed this instead of just being comforted so that they don’t feel bad. Most will fail in the next bull cycle as is always the case in every market. Take perpetual steps to not be one of them.

Downvote away if it makes you feel better, I’m here for you.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

**Your beliefs and emotions are far more easier to manipulate than facts and historical data and strategies.**

**If you want things to change, change how you do things.**

**Educate yourself for the rest of your life if you want to succeed.**

**If you're part of the herd, prepare to follow it into the slaughterhouse every time.**

EDIT: A great question in the comments came up: "" 

Then you proceed to state that all types of education are useless and never explain what people should be doing.

How should people educate themselves then according to you!?""

Here is my response: 

Everyone I have discussions with have their own style because how they got there is different to everyone else got to theirs. 

Start with the basics to see what works and doesn't work and then look into why things worked/didn't work and/or under what circumstances do/don't.

I personally started with a free online course somewhere that taught me candlestick patterns for daytrading, thought that those things were written in stone, and then dismissed it all because they didn't work. Then I started asking why they worked sometimes and not other times, which led to the understanding that macro conditions can have a power influence which only led me to more questions.

So then I took a college program on macro and microeconomics. Took general business and accounting alongside that just because.

Years later now I scrutinize what institutions are doing and what they meant in the past and how they might be doing something differently or not this time. I stare at charts all day for a living, occasionally daytrading when I see a good opportunity, but the price is the thing that I look at the least. I know others who also do well who focus specifically on price, and how they got there is entirely different to my story.

I didn't write up how to pursue the education I speak of, because that's entirely up to you. If I told you exactly how to go about doing things, I'd be just like the influencers people follow, and you'd be part of the herd."

26/2/23,An Exercise in Adoption (Part 1),"There's a lot of price speculation on this sub. It's understandable. Most people get into Crypto for the potential to make a lot of money in a short period of time. But if you're still hanging around after the year we all just had in 2022, odds are you're here for the long haul and counting on Crypto going mainstream in the future.

I also see a lot of speculation on adoption. Makes sense too. More adoption= more demand= price go up. But maybe take a second to consider whether YOU have adopted Crypto. Sure, you're hanging out in this sub and you hold Crypto in your wallet. But do you actually use it? Have you explored what you can actually do with your coins other holding or trying to make more money off of them?

I suspect that for more than a few of us the answer, might be no. Which is a shame, because while we're hanging out in Bear land actually using crypto is probably the best thing you can do as an individual to help boost adoption (and so price). Crypto relies heavily on the network effect, so if you want to see it succeed you should join in to contribute to that network effect!

With that in mind I thought it might be a good idea to dive into some of the tools, platforms and protocols that are living and breathing Crypto use cases, as something of a series. Many of these platforms have fairly small userbases.  /r/cc has 6.1 million subscribers. If even 1% of subscribers started using or participating in some of these platforms it could make a huge difference to these individual communities and to adoption as a whole

https://preview.redd.it/hjjphm0j0jka1.png?width=1840&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c10428f8127ac46287b4aad6bc185c5ba8f7f31f

Snapshot is a free, open source hybrid voting tool for community governance, used by a lot of big DAOs you've probably heard of. Authentication of DAO members occurs using the blockchain in a read only manner (Metamask works well!) DAOs can set different requirements for eligibility to vote, such as holding a particular token or NFT. Since you're authenticating through your wallet these details can be authenticated as well. They can also choose from a wide range of different voting strategies (voting by token weight, one vote per NFT held, one vote per unique individual, etc). Because authentication is read only, it doesn't cost any gas. You simply sign-in through your wallet.

&#x200B;

[Voting on Snapshot](https://preview.redd.it/rxlmiwc13jka1.png?width=1865&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=80655f039b93eec02a707342a5cee9d818f654eb)

Once the eligible DAO members are authenticated they can vote. In the example above GitcoinDAO is running votes using a weighted token strategy (The more GTC tokens you have the more your vote counts). Since users have been authenticated using the blockchain, voting can now occur off-chain. This means there is no gas cost to vote either. DAO members can also delegate their vote to another eligible member using Snapshot, if they are not keen on being heavily involved in community governance.

&#x200B;

[Creating a space on Snapshot](https://preview.redd.it/zjs2urps5jka1.png?width=1887&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d32f13514a11404092e42b0f4cab905cd8c81024)

Setting up your own space for voting is super easy as well. You need a basic understanding of how Crypto works (public addresses, wallets, etc), but you don't need any coding knowledge. To me it's reminiscent of GoDaddy or the like in Web2. Everything is pretty well spoon fed to you in non-technical way, which is fantastic! The easier these tools are to use, the faster adoption will occur.  To setup a space you'll need to pay gas fees and you'll need an ENS name; but it's pretty incredible that someone with only a basic knowledge of Crypto could start their own DAO and setup such a key component as Community Governance so easily.

&#x200B;

Highly recommend you go click around and explore some of the lesser known DAOs using the platform and see what their voting on. Maybe consider joining a DAO that interests you and playing around!"

26/2/23,"I’ve been in the crypto space for 1 year now, and here’s what I’ve learned, and my advice to new comers to crypto.","#MY MISTAKE #1: You are not an unstoppable force

Making your first win, being in the green and then getting cocky. Everyone has done it, you make a good trade and think you’re unstoppable. 

This leads to a deep rabbit hole of buying random unknown coins hoping it’ll 100x

#MY MISTAKE #2: Buying unknown coins is gambling, not investing.

Like I said before, buying random alt coins, before you do this. Remember it’s gambling, it’s a gamble and just because it’s a new coin doesn’t mean it’s to the moon. 

#MISTAKE #3: When you need technical help, DON’T ANSWER TO DMS, only public comments.

Don’t trust anyone in dms, generally if you’re having a technical issue with crypto and someone helps you in dms. 9 times out of 10 they are trying to drain your wallet.

If someone comments on your Reddit post asking for help, then usually it’s a better bet to trust them, because they can’t scam you publicly. Why? Because people will call them out for it. (I’m not saying trust everyone in a comments section).

#MISTAKE #4: Do your own research 100% of the time.

Do your own research, it’s generally good to get advice from people who have been in the space for a long time.

That being said we’ve all lost money, we’ve all made money, we’ve missed out on opportunities. My biggest mistake was selling too early, otherwise known as a paperhand. 

Now I cannot stress this enough, NO YOUR OWN RESEARCH, if you own a coin. And I ask you why you bought that coin, and you can’t give me a complete answer with reasons, motives, problem it solves. Why are you even buying it? 

People too often just buy some random coins because maybe they’re up 20% and they think it’ll go more, or maybe people will buy it because of hype. 

Nonetheless if it doesn’t solve a problem, don’t touch it. (Or provide an upgrade to something that already exists). 

#MY MISTAKE #5: Humans are greedy, don’t trust people with control over your crypto.

Trust no one, I don’t trust exchanges, I don’t trust custodial wallets, I don’t trust cefi. And nor should you, if you do a simple google search on every exchange, every cefi, every custodial wallet companies that have shut down. 

And all the drama with it, all the massive fees, the company getting hacked, the company not letting you withdraw. 

I will sell/buy Crypto on an exchange and take it right off, you never leave it on there. The biggest reason I’ve heard people say why they keep it on is because of the withdrawal fees. 

Think of it like this, would you rather pay $5 in withdrawal fees or lose $500 because an exchange went bankrupt. 

#MY MISTAKE #6: Don’t buy shitcoins, and make sure to keep your money balanced in a rule I called a ‘40 40 20 Rule’

No not buy shitcoins, do not buy unknown coins, this is my rule and I think everyone should follow it: 

40% BTC
40% ETH
20% Alts (Top 20 coins).

When I say Alts, I mean matic, xrp, avax, atom. Those coins, not random unknown coins. 


#CONCLUSION 

That’s all I’ve learned so far, (the main big stuff). Good luck new comers to Crypto. 

And everyone else feel free to share some advice you’ve learnt in the comments."

Today, i want to discuss Bitcoin, considered solely as a speculative asset with no inherent value and why it's probably the best upside risk option anyway. If one assumes the outlandish projections of certain enthusiasts - for example, that its value may reach an arbitrary figure by 2030  - the risk-reward ratio of investing in Bitcoin is unmatched

For instance, investing $100 now at its current $23,000, and holding it until it reaches a hypothetical value of $1,000,000, would yield a profit of $4,000. Even in the worst-case scenario, where Bitcoin's value drops to zero, the loss would be limited to the initial $100 investment.

From the perspective of an investor focused on the speculative potential of ""magic internet money,"" Bitcoin offers a unique value. It's not advisable to assume that past success in a single cryptocurrency will automatically translate to Bitcoin, as each asset is err...""unique""

Bitcoin, through a gambler's perspective, says the likelihood of its value plummeting to zero is extremely low. Some say even zero

Heres a few factors that support this view. 

Firstly, the principle of supply and demand - there will always be people eager to buy Bitcoin, especially at lower prices.

Secondly, Bitcoin's ability to transcend borders and its utility alone makes it incredible.  Some individuals have no other option for a digital bank account but to use Bitcoin. 

Thirdly, significant investors have already embraced Bitcoin, even if they claim to dislike it. 

Finally, the fact that a significant amount of Bitcoin has been lost forever - including the founder's wallet - means that there is less selling pressure that could drive the price down."

Second most hated would be the 'LUNAtics', but seems like they don't come here either because they know they will be ridiculed from the front to the back. Or maybe, the cult leaders there don't want their members to venture outside their cave for fear they exercise some independent thinking.

Anyway, the poll has the 6 most active coin mentions on CC/sub. To be clear: I think all the coins have their utility, but we are just finding out which community is the worst, or the most annoying here.

This means that corporations all have a sustainability strategy and cannot be seen to be using carbon burning platforms for Web 3. 

Web 3 is the future and Hedera is ready for the explosion it’s at 0.8cents now, predicting an easy $3-6 dollars when things warm up.

2) Shibadoge (Shibdoge)- is my token which doesn’t reflect my Hedera holding.

What the devs are saying is why not unite Shib and Doge armies? It’s brilliant and obvious. We ALL know on Reddit, the power of collective buying…people are taking notice of this sweet little token and it has a solid eco system which is fun for all. I’m only holding the tokens though and not the NFT’s etc. 

I really like the community- the best I’ve seen in my 8/9 years in the space. Just check out their Telegram channel which is on fire.

*Disclaimer: This is a repost. For some reason, it was falsely flagged as spam by the Reddit filter. Mods suggested reposting it.*

*TL;DR*

*Just a little twist on six thinking hats to make it more memorable. The main goal is to develop a more balanced view of any project or crypto itself. But first, we need to choose a topic. Pick an important question or issue so it would be worth the effort.*

***Thinking hats:***

* ***Optimist*** *- Why will it succeed?*
* ***Pessimist*** *- Why will it fail?*
* ***Realist*** *- How to prevent failure? Is it possible?*
* ***Exploiter*** *- How to extract the most value, by any means if necessary?*
* ***Conspiracy theorist*** *- Who is pulling strings? How?*
* ***Tech*** *- What is possible now technologically? What will be in the future?*
* ***Hater*** *- How could I destroy it? What is my next step?*
* ***Strategist*** *- How should I prepare for risks and opportunities?*

*You are using some of these hats. But do you know which you use the most?*

*The* ***ratio*** *between hats you are using is critical. Siting with an optimist hat for too long, you will become too naive and easy to exploit. Become aware of the ratio, and remember others' hats.*

*You can use* ***more hats*** *at once and emphasize some of them more. You can produce more personas and generate more ideas by stacking more hats. You can even simulate a particular group or community.*

*You can create artificial* ***discussions*** *between hats(stacked or not). You can do it by yourself or with friends. You can have two or more speakers. This exercise will produce different results than just going hat after hat.*

*So you use some hats and make conversations, but what is the* ***observer*** *using? The observer can also use any hat combo. It is a good time for* ***9th hat***\*, critical thinking. Time to question the results, belief, and thinking itself.\*

*Diversify your information sources and communities. The last thing you want is to get stuck in an echo chamber for too long.*

# Introduction

Just a little twist on six thinking hats to make it more memorable. The main goal is to have a more balanced view of events, predictions, and the crypto space itself. And we achieve it by consciously and systematically questioning any topic and ourselves from different angles.

You also stretch your imagination. Open yourself to more possibilities, and see everything in more colors. By doing it, you increase the chance of being more prepared for what will come.

# Pick a topic

First, you must choose a topic, statement, or question to explore. I recommend going after more significant ideas if you are planning to do all steps. The general rule, you should pick something worth the effort. You have to start prioritizing. Which questions will give a better yield?

Some examples:

* Will crypto change the world for the better?
* Crypto will be adopted globally
* Decentralized social media is inevitable.
* Is most projects just a scam?
* BTC halving
* ETH coming updates

# Thinkings Hats

[Thinkings hats](https://preview.redd.it/yv3m10mlxhka1.png?width=1227&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6ce223313c2c7eb692a7abdff498d081ed7b8d58)

* **Optimist**
   * One of our favorites. Once you put on this hat, you can't see how crypto(or a minor part) could fail. Success is inevitable.
   * Endless possibilities for how crypto(or project) will succeed.
   * Why will it succeed? Why will we win? Why is it not possible to stop it?
* **Pessimist**
   * Pessimists can still love crypto, but now you see an endless variety of how it could fail. Whatever project, the future is still dark for it.
   * Why will it fail? Why will the price go down? Why will it not change the world?
* **Realist**
   * Realist is not in the middle between optimist and pessimist. Realists see it as it is, and it might be even if it is closer to pessimism. Once new data and insights come, you are willing to slide within this spectrum.
   * What do we have to do so it will succeed? How can we stop failure?
* **Exploiter**
   * With this hat, your only interest is yourself and resources. You no longer care for others. You extract value by whatever means possible. You can steal crypto, make more sophisticated plans, or play by ""rules.""
   * How can I exploit others? What mistake are others making? How could I influence others to do what I want?
* **Conspiracy Theorist**
   * Now everywhere you see a conspiracy, it's just part of a bigger plan. You question the intentions of individual projects and crypto itself.
   * Who is behind it? How are they trying to exploit others? Did crypto start as an organic movement? Who is pulling the strings in the shadows?
* **Tech**
   * With this hat, your only interest is tech. Its current state and possible future states. How it will develop in the future.
   * What problems do we have now? How to solve it? What piece of tech is necessary? Who is innovating? What will be possible?
* **Hater**
   * Now, most people love to hate you. You love to hate too. You have a burning desire to see crypto disappearing. You are willing to spread the word about how bad it is and influence as many people as possible.
   * How to harm them? Wich data to cherry-pick? How could I help to destroy it?
* **Strategist**
   * With this hat, you strategize. Hopefully, you were using the other seven hats, and now you have a nice list of possible outcomes, risks, and opportunities. Now you prepare for them.
   * How can I increase my chances of success? How to minimize or eliminate risks? What will other players do? How will I respond to most of the events?

You can use them in order, one by one. Add more hats if you wish. Even use socks instead of hats. It is fun to explore each individually, but we can make it even more fun.

# The Ratio

[The ratio. Only example.](https://preview.redd.it/mexhep4txhka1.png?width=1745&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a6f89e9511a91f12b4c96d7d5e68f1505741bf8c)

You are already doing it to some degree, but are you aware of your personal hats ratio? The ratio is significant because it will directly influence your actions. For example, sitting with a primarily optimistic hat, you will have huge gaps on most risks. To pessimistic? Then you will give up to early, without a fight.

You can experiment with ratios. First, it would be a good idea to use hats more which you overlook most of the time. This will allow an increasing chance of aligning your worldview with reality. But you are free to adjust the ratio based on the situation.

# Hats stacking

[Some stacks examples.](https://preview.redd.it/cl74ncz0yhka1.png?width=1096&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2aa0cc47ce6f94eeda2e4f045e3b2c079a90ab79)

Another step would be stacking more hats, as much as you want. You can emphasize some of them more and fine-tune the personas. These stacks could also represent a community or group because it's unrealistic to think everyone wears only one.

Keep in mind that we can have a variety of different stacks here. It would take a lot of energy to try every combination every time. The goal should be to aim at least for a few stacks, which makes sense to you based on the situation.

Some stacks feel awkward. In that case, you should fine-tune it and rephrase it. For example, optimist and hater. By my provided definition, they love and hate crypto at the same time. It could be rephrased like this:

* Hater who is very optimistic about upcoming crypto failure or
* Optimists who love most of the crypto but hate some parts of it

[Examples of discussion stacks.](https://preview.redd.it/yx1xovc7yhka1.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c515680131a99c22688623f992efc8d1af0d797b)

You can use hats as individual steps or create discussions between them. You can have as many speakers as makes sense to you. You can try it with friends.

It is more like a creativity exercise. In such discussions, you will be able to produce more interesting ideas. Moreover, defending yourself intellectually from a few angles will develop you better.

But we still have one problem our possible hats, hat stacking, and discussion combination grew exponentially. So again, you should prioritize some combinations more based on the situation. Play around with it.

# The Observer

&#x200B;

[The observer.](https://preview.redd.it/hgxh80bbyhka1.png?width=1163&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1943abf9d42bfe4ea9ea8013b59b46e2fd15a9fe)

You switch hats, doing some discussions and generating ideas. Good, now time to go more meta. The observer is observing all these discussions and hats it were. The observer can use any hat combo, or you could add more observers if you have more time.

Now would be an excellent time to add one more hat, critical thinking. After you generate some ideas, remember to question them:

* How do I know if I am wearing it?
* Am I a realist now? How do I know it?
* Why I chose mostly these hats?
* How am I biased here?
* Am I still using similar thinking patterns?
* Why do I hate some of these hats?

# Conclusion

Well, this is not a groundbreaking discovery. Some parts we are already naturally applying as we learn. But it's still essential to use it constantly. If you want to improve, you can't look at only one worldview.

Such techniques should be applied not only to crypto but also to other important areas of your life.

To build a habit, you can simplify everything and ask at least one question per hat. Introduce discusion later.

Keep in mind your information sources and communities. You should diversify here at least a few more worldviews. Or you will get stuck in an echo chamber.

I hope you find it useful. What are your thoughts on it? What is your favorite hat? What hat would you add? Don't like something, why?

26/2/23,Crypto is just regular IT marketed to the extreme.,"Three years ago i started getting into crypto. I learned about all the different coins, wallets, exchanges, blockchains and all of it was generally a bit overwhelming.

It all seemed so incredible and new, everything was promising to push the boundaries of tech as we knew it.
And i was there to witness it and even gain a bit of money whilst doing so!

I got to the point where it sparked an interest in developing in me. So i started studying to be able to code.

I ended up getting a job as a frontend dev, and soon branched out to fullstack.

Funnily enough, this is where i found my interest in crypto diminishing.

The more i learned about actual tech, and the more i started to use programs that were available outside of the crypto sphere, the more i felt that what most projects are doing isn’t exactly new…or needs crypto/blockchain tech at all…

It kind of turned me into a bitcoin maxi..

Realizing that in spite of all the noise crypto makes, the only real innovation is the very first. A decentralized way to store wealth.

Thats it!

The rest is just pretty marketing of things that already exist in the regular it sphere…i mean nft’s for example are just literally a transferable hash with a image/video attached…..a hash!!!

Call me jaded, but the more i learn, the less impressed i seem to be.


Just felt like sharing, and maybe warning some of you, that not all that glitters is gold."

There are many use cases for different coins. Some countries might have welcomed Bitcoin to their stores, while in some hotels you might book a room with it. 

While it's mostly used straightforward as a currency, there are helpful cases for crypto - tips, charities, helping those who lost their homes due to war.. And some considered to go with more widespread problem, that needs almost everyone's attention. Ecological state of our world.

However from other scourses like Youtube, the bitbox 02 (Bitcoin only Edition) appeares to be the most reccomend  option for storing btc.
Is the bitbox 02 pushed by german youtubers (like Roman Eher and Niko Jilch) or is it fine and maybe undertepresented in this forum? 
Has anyone tried the bitbox and can reccomend it or has any complains? 
I personally tested the ledger nano s and the bitbox 02. Both are fine in my opionion. I dont like the ledgers partly closed source policy and the storage of customer data.

26/2/23,Electrum X server,"I wanted to use my own node for broadcasting bitcoin transactions. Since my node runs on a public facing BTCPay server, I figured the best way was to install an ElectrumX server, so I did and it's been up and running for a couple of months.

I've been able to connect to it using Electrum (desktop), and Blue Wallet (Android). For some reason I am unable to connect with Phoenix.

I haven't tried any other wallets.

If anyone wants to use an Electrum server to interface with the bitcoin network, you can find one at [https://btc.arnzenarms.com:50002](https://btc.arnzenarms.com:50002)

I can't seem to find a list anywhere of all the electrum compatible bitcoin wallets so I can't test them.

This is a non-custodial server. It is only a gateway to the bitcoin network. It should allow you to do things like check your balance and broadcast transactions. Every wallet you use connects either to a node you control directly via RPC or through something like this server. 

Most wallets will connect to a somewhat centralized server (eg. Ledger) or possibly a random electrum server (eg. Phoenix). This process leaks a little privacy since the server knows the IP making the requests, but the rest of the data is publicly available on the blockchain. Though the IP can be obfuscated using Tor or a VPN. 

If you don't want to run your own server, and like the idea of a gun store's server processing your bitcoin transactions. Feel free to use mine.

Is this currently more of an issue because of a higher liquid supply? Meaning hopefully in the future, as more coins are bought up, held, and transferred to wallets;  the amount of Iou's would be dramatically reduced? 

So right now, because of most exchange practices with Iou's; it's being manipulated more like a stock. but as adoption grows and less liquidity is achieved it will become a/the more stable currency it was designed to be.
At that point there would be more of an honest ""price"" realization and less volatility? Am I understand this right at all?

26/2/23,There should be no correlation between mining difficulty and price,"Someone posted That Bitcoin Mining difficulty hit a new ATH and I always see people talking about how Bitcoin price Will follow and increase as well. I dont see the connection. Maybe someone can explain what is going on.

My thoughts:
There is always a predictable amount of freshly mined Bitcoin per time on the market regardless the mining difficulty. Why should the market care about the involved mining costs? Bitcoin doesnt get more rare because of It. When there are more miners, the difficulty increases and when there are less miners, It decreases. When miners stop operating, there is no loss of supply. The amount of mined Bitcoin per time stays the same so the amount of fresh Bitcoin hitting the markets also stays the same.

When we compare It to gold mining, its logical that an increase in mining difficulty and mining costs can indeed result in a decrease of supply per time. When its too expensive to mine gold, there is nothing that Will magically decrease the difficulty of gold mining so miners stopping to operate is a real loss of new supply per time which Will make It more rare and can result in price increase. 

The only thing comparable to that is Bitcoin halving which decreases Bitcoin supply and make it more rare. those events indeed showed a price increase of Bitcoin which is logical when there is suddenly only half the amount of new Bitcoin per time available on market.

One argument that I found is that more miners can mean a more secure Network which make Bitcoin itself more valuable. But i kinda doubt This Will have such an impact at This point to be honest. At least not like the price increases due to decrease of supply."

26/2/23,Tips to protect yourself from crypto scams,"Hello everyone.

Despite our efforts to filter the content in the sub, and to limit as much as we can the scam posts, they always find a way to crawl back in.

With crypto becoming more and more popular around the world, so has the creativity of scammers looking to target inexperienced traders and/or investors.
But even if you’re not brand new in the crypto space, don’t think you’re immune to falling for these schemes.
It’s quite challenging to stay on top of the latest news regarding crypto fraud and theft.

Cryptocurrency scams are becoming more sophisticated but there are ways to avoid becoming a victim.

**With that being said, let’s go over some helpful tips to protect yourself from crypto scams.**

• **Never share your wallet’s seed phrase.**

If someone or something requests you to share the seed phrase of your crypto wallet, to participate in an investment opportunity, or to “restore” or “load” your account, it’s utterly a scam to steal your holdings.

Never share your seed phrase or private keys with anyone. Even if your girlfriend asks for it. *Wait a minute, you’re a crypto bro, you don’t have a girlfriend 😎.*

Additional tip: Keep your seed phrase somewhere safe.

• **It’s a cliche, but it’s a fact. The good ol’ DYOR (Do your own research).**

If you’re unfamiliar with a specific project, and don’t know what makes it special, different or even better than the others, do your homework.
Search online using the company name as well as the cryptocurrency name. You can even search it on Reddit, the number one source for financial advice (*wink wink*).

• **This is a big one: Ignore urgent requests.**

The worms try to use high-pressure tactics to get you to send your money quickly.
They may offer discounts or bonuses if you act instantly. Or they may pretend to be a friend in an emergency who needs money sent as crypto. They can even be a certain Nigerian Prince contacting you because of a certain deal.

Pay extreme attention to heavy sales pitches to “Invest now!”. It’s probably a “pump and dump” scam.

Urgent payment requests are a big warning sign. If you receive them, just delete them and move on with your beautiful life.

• **Be suspicious of social media posts.**

Social media is currently the most profitable method used by scammers, because it’s the most effective when it comes to reaching people.

They may claim that influencers or celebrities endorse their projects, or are even investors. Sometimes they may actually be the influencers or celebrities themselves.

And if a beautiful Japanese girl slides in your DM’s, there’s a high chance it’s a romance scam. I’m not saying you’re ugly and get no🐱, I’m just trying to be that honest friend you never had.

• **Double check the website address.**

When visiting a crypto related website, please check the URL before entering any information.

If you’re unfamiliar with a cryptocurrency’s website, get the URL from an official source, such as the cryptocurrency’s official Twitter account.
You can also use CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko. Simply search for the specific cryptocurrency and look for the link to their official website.

• **Download apps**

If you’re asked to download a mobile app outside App Store or Google Play Store, which is known as ”sideloading“, just don’t do it. These apps have NOT been reviewed by Apple or Google.

You could be downloading a fake mobile wallet. Once you send any crypto into this wallet, it will be immediately transferred to a wallet that definitely won’t be yours.

• **Avoid “promises” and “guarantees”.**

If something or someone promises you high returns, it’s most likely a scam.

26/2/23,The ABSURDITY of the SECs view on airdrops (and MOONS?),"As I, like many other r/cc long-time lurkers, received my first MOONs distribution this past week, I began to look into the tax implications.  

I came upon this article and many others like it: [medium.com/broctagongroup/demystifying-sec-order-on-airdrops-52b3fed8bc47](https://medium.com/broctagongroup/demystifying-sec-order-on-airdrops-52b3fed8bc47)

“The key reason why airdrops are considered to be a sale of securities is that the tokens themselves are considered securities. What constitutes a security differs from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. So long as the token itself is not considered a security in a particular jurisdiction, the airdrop should be legal. Hence, issuers may be able to continue to use airdrops to spread awareness about their projects in most non-US jurisdictions as long as the tokens themselves are not considered a security in a particular jurisdiction.”

If MOONs are used as a means for the r/cc subreddit to generate revenue through banner ads, the Howey Test then comes into play.  This is an incredibly gray area, but for the sake of this post I will assume that in the eyes of the SEC that MOONs are a security.

Under that premise, upon receiving a MOONs distribution the MOONs recipient would be liable to owe tax on the received MOONs based on the spot price.  The absurdity begins there…

MOONs have a 24hr volume of ~$43,000 based on my quick googling.  [https://coinstats.app/coins/moon/](https://coinstats.app/coins/moon/)

For a top contributor that has earned several thousand MOONs, they’d be expected to owe tax on the spot price of $0.18 despite the fact that their sell pressure would cause a significant drop in price due to the low liquidity.

I truly feel that this needs to gain attention!"

Coinbase only provides 1099 and all is reported on line 3.

What types of items are included in this line?

If coin sale/income is included; do they net out the purchase expense?

Any guidance would be appreciated.

Repost of my original message:

""You have $0.00 remaining of your daily limit of $0.00 for this linked account.""

Okay, well...after 5 years of being a Coinbase user, I hit my first ever roadblock.  


It started this afternoon when I had a few bucks left on a Chime card and decided to spend $50 on Coinbase. I got the ""suspicious activity"" message and it would not take. I put in a second buy and realized I used the Chime card again without thinking....but the transaction went through! Great!  


I had $20 left on it and decided to just finish off the balance...""insufficient funds.""  


I shrug it off and use my main funding method (my brick and mortar bank)...and then it hit me with ""You have $0.00 remaining of your daily limit of $0.00 for this linked account."" I checked my account limits -- 50k a day, maxed out the verification, all good, right? Nope....still $0.00  


I contacted support via e-mail and got a response saying they cannot raise my purchase limits due to 'regulations'. It was as if my message was skimmed...I don't want to raise it to over 50k a day. I just want the daily limit lifted over $0.00. I know there's a correlation between the 'suspicious activity' (I've only used the Chime card a handful of times) and knocking it down to $0 a day....  


I offered to provide proof it was me that was putting in the buys in hopes of getting the $0 limit lifted...but I felt like I was largely ignored and was left with a bot response.  


Any help would be greatly appreciated...and I am terribly sorry for this essay I just wrote. Heh.  


Thank you"
