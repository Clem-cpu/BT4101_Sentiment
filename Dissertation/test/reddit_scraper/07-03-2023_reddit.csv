5/3/23,Man who accidently threw away his computer filled with bitcoin has finally found it in the dump.,"After years of looking for his lost computer that he believed was filled with 7,500 bitcoins the man has found it.

the entire thing cost him around 2.5 million after paying for excavators, labor and city permits to dig up the landfill. He was relieved after finding the computer last month and had a professional data recovery company working on it for the last four weeks trying to recover his lost wallet, this cost alone was $400k.

Unfortunately it turns out the wallet was actually filled with bitcoin cash a hard fork of bitcoin worth a fraction of the price of actual bitcoin.

7,500 x $124 + $930k

so he is now about 1.6 million in debt to cover the cost of the loan he took out using the believed bitcoin as collateral.

6/3/23,"Mt. Gox creditors will finally start receiving their Bitcoin from March 10 as 137,890 Bitcoin with a value of more than 3 Billion will get unlocked","# Historic overview

Mt. Gox was a bitcoin exchange based in Tokyo, Japan. This exchange launched in 2010, though orginally it was founded in 2006 as an exchange to trade Magic: The Gathering Online cards. That explains the acronom MTGOX. In early 2014, it handled over 70% of all Bitcoin transactions:

Then, February 2014, when it all looked golden for Mt Gox, customer complaints were increasingas people were experiencing huge delays trying to withdraw their Bitcoin. Mt. Gox then suddenly  suddenly ceased operations on 7 February 2014 due to revelations of its involvement in the loss (well, theft) of 850K Bitcoin. That would be more than 4% of the total Bitcoin supply right now.

Wizsec, a security company, concluded a year later that ""most or all of the missing bitcoins were stolen straight out of the Mt. Gox hot cryptocurrency wallet over time, beginning in late 2011."" This has often been labeled as the biggest black swan in history.

&#x200B;

# Now, the unlocks will finally start

As of March 10, 137,890 Bitcoin will (start to) be unlocked. The value is over 3 billion USD. With Bitcoin at a price of $22,430 at the time of writing, this is an insane increase for the creditors, because when they lost access to their Bitcoin, the value of Bitcoin was around $800.

The question is, what will the effect be on Bitcoin's price and how much of the 138K Bitcoins will be sold? The creditors are sitting on a lot of profit thanks to forced HODL. We already know from 2022 that a relatively minor percentage of the supply can do a lot of damage to the price of Bitcoin..."

6/3/23,An ominous looking letter received in the mail,"Today I received a thick envelope, very official and legal looking, from New York (I live in London, UK). It must have cost maybe $10 in postage and god knows how much in other fees to get it to me. Honestly I was a little worried as it looked like bad news.

Upon opening it, it was a large pack of forms to fill in to register as a creditor to the BlockFi liquidation, sent by the liquidators.

The amount I am owed by BlockFi as stated within the package? $0.22

I think I had some LTC dust in there and that was it. I hope they don't waste any more money trying to help me get it back.

Did anyone else receive the same thing and am I safe just to ignore it? They can keep my 22 cents."
6/3/23,"You want crypto adoption, but you don't want to do things that improve crypto adoption","**Regulation**

You hate regulation and that is fine. A lot of things that are being regulated I do not agree with.

BUT, without EFFECTIVE regulation, there is less adoption. In order to adopt crypto more, we need EFFECTIVE regulations. Just imagine internet today without any rules. It would be impossible to exist.

People hate spending crypto, yet they talk about using crypto as a currency in everyday use.

**Taxation**

Yes OMG, taxes suck! But, thats how most of our countries work.

Yet again, I am not saying that we need to make life of a crypto trader miserable with taxes, but we do need them. Good and effective ones. Doing so we will make market more reliable and stable...it would also attract people to invest more.

**Merchanats that support crypto but don't want to accept it**

This is just an example, there is a lot of people who support crypto but don't want to accept it in their business. I get it, it can be tricky, but you can always use Stablecoins if you are worried about volatility.

6/3/23,The SEC is starting its attack on Bitcoin mining: The SEC just filed a case in the federal court alleging that selling crypto mining equipment and offering hosting services for that equipment is an unregistered securities offering,"James ""MetaLawMan"" Murphy (MetaLawMan on Twitter) is a lawyer that provides research, analysis, and commentary on legal and business issues arising in the world of digital assets and the metaverse.

James Murphy just revealed that the SEC filed a case in the federal court in Utah alleging that *""selling crypto mining equipment and offering hosting services for the equipment constitutes an investement contract under Howey"".* James previously worked with some of the lawyers that represent some of the defendants in this case.

Some of these mining machines are Bitcoin Antminers. Many companies in the US are selling mining equipment and offering hosting services. These companies have been doing so for years without any issue. The SEC has never given any guidance suggesting that selling equipment for mining would be an unregistered securities offering.

We have to wait for the official filing, but it looks like the SEC is escalating the fight against crypto. In James words: ""*The overreach is accelerating. Congress needs to act.""*

I agree. This is insane? Anything is a security according to the SEC. Is this not going to hurt the United States' role in crypto and push people to go elsewhere? I better warn my neighbour's 6 year old that is selling orange juice on the street. Gary is going to come for her next.

The main goal of this liquidity rewards program is to help deepen the liquidity for the MOON/ETH pool on Sushiswap, to allow advertisers to easily purchase $MOONS for renting out the subs banner.

Deepening the liquidity would also encourage more users to hold $MOON and start participating in various activities on the sub as stated by [TraderSubs239](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/11csc2a/moons_have_no_utility_here_is_everything_that/):

* Hold $MOON to vote in various polls on the sub
* Tipping
* Purchasing of premium membership on the sub
* AMAs
* Price speculation

Here are some current stats of the MOON/ETH pool (Taken from the sticky post):

* Liquidity providers have currently contributed 636561 moons and 84.6274 ETH to the pool (260K USD in total)
* **7.50 $SUSHI** and **1.26k** **$MOONS** are currently being divided up between all liquidity providers **per day**
* Current [APR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvmfPrSXE7w) \- 56.69%

Essentially, users providing liquidity to the MOON/ETH will earn rewards from 3 sources 🤯:

1. Trading fees from the MOON/ETH pool
2. $SUSHI token rewards
3. $MOON token rewards

Also, don't hesitate to throw any queries at me, I'm all ears!  


Edit: Thanks for the pinned post 🙏 We're really grateful to have the support from the community.

1 topic that I have observed many individuals discussing is the potential hazards of providing liquidity. I want emphasize that there exists a risk called [Impermanent Loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XJ1MSTEuU0).

If you are a beginner and unfamiliar with the concept of Impermanent Loss, you should educate yourself on the subject before deciding to provide liquidity. If you can't be bothered, it may be wiser to simply HODL your $MOONs and wait for them to appreciate in value 🚀 "

6/3/23,One of the biggest regrets in 8+ years of active crypto investing is the fatigued-selling (for loss) during the prolonged bear market last time.,"Like many, I acquired a bunch of tokens of ""promising projects"" during the 2017-2018 bull cycle/ ICO boom. Some of the projects had solid problem statement, team, funding and community. There was a nice spike in prices in these projects after launch and it felt like a genius for investing in those projects.

BUT following bear markets were brutal. Values plummeted, portfolio seemed meaningless for most coins and it hurt badly. What was worse, for those who lived through that time, it felt never ending :( (if you are living through 2022-23 bear cycle and it feels never ending, these cycles always feel that way until they stop feeling that way). I kept an eye on the projects I had invested and was optimistic/ hopeful every time I saw the portfolio. This kept on going for very long and slowly it started to annoy and giving fatigue. The belief in crypto/ blockchain never went away but somehow the belief in those projects that I had invested in started to fade. I started to feel may be those would never recover.

AND then came one of the worst mistakes of life in Crypto so far - I reached a point of fatigue and frustration that I lost interest in tracking those projects and I started getting rid of those coins and sold many of those (converted to ETH/BTC) for 80-90%+ losses. 

HOWEVER, as the law of markets, it always return to bull cycle, I regretted that fatigue-selling every single day in the following bull cycle. Without getting into specific dollar numbers, I could have easily 4-6x my investment on almost all of those projects (except a few). I regret this even today.

BOTTOM LINE, **impatience has been the worst enemy to my crypto gains over the year**, not the market cycle, nor the shady YouTubers/Influencers, nor anything else. Well, sometimes, that's how we learn."
6/3/23,Its funny how everyone during the last bull market were saying: “I would pay to buy BTC under $20k“ but most of them left when we were not even halfway there.,"While thinking back to one of my own best or most “euphoric“ moments in Crypto, it would certainly be the end of 2021, where we just seemed to be back on a rally after the China mining ban caused a crash before and this coupled with the Futures ETF releasing made up one of the most euphoric phases in Crypto as nearly everyone was expectant something like $100 by End of Year.

&#x200B;

[From my TradingView, close-up of Nov 2021](https://preview.redd.it/j2wbm4nno6ma1.jpg?width=2200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e857000c7a8b890d5380ae900d3be8f512540065)

But this was not, we obviously also had occasional drops like when we reached the ATH at $64k and dropped for a week below, there was no drop in sentiment though. People were still euphoric but some had regret that they did not buy more or did not enter Crypto early, their famous phrase often was: “I would buy BTC below $20k in a heartbeat“.

&#x200B;

[Trading Volume chart from Blockchain .com site](https://preview.redd.it/duzpf6pro6ma1.jpg?width=1239&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=29782aab4aac0d15a794828e5afb14de15fd49f1)

Well, here we are and we can say that most of those that really wanted us to go lower so that they could buy the “dip“ had already left us a long while ago. On this chart we can also pretty well see how the trading volume has been decreasing as we dropped lower, this may be one of the closest ways to identify how many investors leave the markets as there is no “user“ metric for Crypto.

And I also think that it will be no surprise that exactly those traders will probably FOMO in next time again and say something like “Wish I could have bought below $50k, would buy there in a heartbeat now“, just to paper-hand directly once the bear starts. Guess this just the Cycle of Crypto…"
6/3/23,A Reminder For The Most Important Dates in March...Take a look!!!,"&#x200B;

**1) Mt Gox Crypto is expected to be released - 10 March**

 A lot of speculation has surrounded the Mt.Gox re-distribution plan. Some believe the traders may hold the BTCs, while others hope a massive selling pressure may kick off a fresh bearish wave ahead. 

&#x200B;

**2) US Jobs Reports - 10 March**

 The U.S. Labor Department will release the highly anticipated February nonfarm payrolls report on Friday, March 10, at 08:30 ET. 

&#x200B;

**3) US CPI report  - 14 March**

 The February consumer price index (CPI) report looms large on Tuesday, March 14, and **analysts expect it could be hotter than January's 6.4% year-over-year pace**, suggesting that the Fed will maintain its fight against inflation 

&#x200B;

**4) Shangai Upgrade - 14 March**

 The much-awaited Ethereum developers have a target to release the Shanghai upgrade on the Goreli testnet by March 14. This could be the final testnet before the mainnet release that is yet to be rolled out.

 Based on Beiko’s (Core Ethereum developer) tweets, the anticipated date for the mainnet depends on the outcome of Goerli on March 14. According to him, if everything goes as planned and Goerli becomes a success, the team could fix a date for the mainnet on the next developers’ meeting slated for March 16.

&#x200B;

**5) US FOMC meeting, Powell speech - 21 - 22  March** 

Later, the FOMC meeting for this month is scheduled on March 21, whose minutes have impacted the entire market for a long time.  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will hold what will be a closely watched press conference shortly after the release of the Fed's statement, as investors look for fresh clues on how he views inflation trends and the economy and how that will impact the pace of monetary policy tightening. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**6)** **US PCE Inflation Report**

 The final economic indicator for the month will arrive on Friday, March 31, when the U.S. government releases the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation.

6/3/23,What is Ethereums newest protocol standard ERC-4337? (ELI-5 edition),"A new Ethereum protocol standard was recently introduced: ERC-4337 which is also known as “account abstraction”. This upgrade enables smart contracts to act as crypto wallets

In layman’s terms it means: instead of using an Ethereum adress + private keys as wallet, you can now use a software-based (smart contract) wallet, directly on chain. 

Why is this interesting? First of all, the ERC-4337 standard is the backbone of account abstraction, so we will have to wait for applications to build on this standard. I.e. wait for people to build these fancy wallets!

ERC-4337 has several advantages:

1) It is fully programmable meaning that no MetaMask is required to make transactions. In fact, your crypto wallet can now look identical to your banks interface, or can be easily be integrated in a website or game
2) Third parties can program this wallet to be compatible with simple username and password and email recovery service.  *this means that reddit can program wallets for users and enable a recovery service without them knowing your private keys for example*. In fact, even you don’t know the private keys because they will be hidden under the hood.
3) This means you don’t have to save a 12 or 24 word phrase anymore and you can more easily recover your wallet when you have forgotten your password (or username)
4) The upgrade is 100% optional. (It is an ERC standard, not a protocol upgrade). Regular addresses still work and will work how they are currently working

All in all account abstraction gets rid of the complicated Ethereum wallets which could mean that even your grandma understands how to send Ethereum in the near future! Start getting your grades up folks!"

6/3/23,Gary Gensler's connection to Binance uncovered in explosive WSJ report,
6/3/23,"193,000 Moons have been burned so far since we started banner advertising a month ago."," 

I have to say I am feeling really bullish these days on Moons since they first appeared in our lives back in 2020.

What started out as an experimental Reddit tipping token on a test net has now evolved into our very own community coin on the Arbitrum Nova network with utility starting to slowly roll out.

Since CCIP-048 passed, we have allowed banner advertisements from the likes of Coingecko and 1inch to be present within the sub once they pay a fee to secure a spot in our banner for a set number of days.

What's unique about this is that these advertisers have to pay for the banner with Moons, not only do they need to go buy the Moons, they will also need to burn the Moons as well by sending it to a burn address that can be found [here](https://nova-explorer.arbitrum.io/address/0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD/tokens#address-tabs). Completely taking them out of circulation and adding value to the Moon token.

If you would like to follow the list of advertisers who already purchased the banner and how many Moons they have burned so far, you can go to this [page](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/banner_records/) and keep track!

I see nothing but good things in the future for Moons 🌑🌑🌑"
6/3/23,APR Rewards from CCIP-051 is at 35% but annual inflation from CCIP-051 rewards is only .43%.,"Whenever conversation of CCIP-051 high reward rate comes up I keep seeing people saying how 35% is so high that it looks like a scam and we'd mock any other token that had such a high APR for their rewards. They keep failing to acknowledge rewards are only so high right now because liquidity on SushiSwap is so low, With an APR of 35% the correlating inflation on Moon Supply from CCIP-051 rewards is only .43%

I'm not sure if they don't understand how liquidity pools work or they're intentionally making bad faith arguments but I felt it was important to educate others on what the inflation from the new rewards actually looks like. 

Rewards = (daily increase)1260\* (days of year)365 = (yearly increase)459,900

Inflation = (yearly increase)459,900/(circulating supply)106,776,318 = .43% (annual Inflation from CCIP-051 rewards)

As the liquidity pool continues to grow (currently at 94 ETH and 700K moons) the APR will continue to drop.  

\------------------------------------------

There are plenty of reasons to be bearish about Moons like: the actual inflation being just over 20% and Reddit owning \~36% of Moons. But CCCIP-051 rewards with .43% inflation is not one of those reasons so please stop spreading bad faith arguments."
6/3/23,Trip Report: El Salvador,"These pics are from Carl's trip. He didn't tell anyone he was traveling until after he landed in San Salvador.

He's a Bitcoin ultra, but no less shares his honest assessment. Bitcoin use in San Salvador (Capital) was hit & miss at local establishments; however, Chivo ATMs are everywhere.

Once he traveled outside the Capital and towards the coast, number of Bitcoin-ready vendors grew substantially.

Locals shared a story w/him. He heard this from 3 independent sources, albeit anecdotal. 

Shortly after the legal tender law went into effect, San Salvador received an influx of *""Chivo Tourists.""* At least that's what they called them.

If you recall, FUD was thick during the first few weeks of Bitcoin's adoption. Evidently, a number of American & European people saw an opportunity. They flew to El Salvador and offered to ""help"" Salvadorian citizens by relieving them of their Chivo Cards. They paid between 20 and 30 cents on the dollar. Frightened people took the deal. It went on for about a month, according to reports Carl picked up. 

Also, Salvadorian Trucking companies who haul throughout Central America were being taken advantage of. Costa Rican & Panamanian companies ran an arbitrage scheme by timing swings in BTC prices to correspond with payments due to truckers. I'll post better details soon as I know more. 

People don't change.

6/3/23,On Binance - They have something called Binance Live. People don’t value their time.,"It’s very interesting and I’m a bit shocked there are people spending their time commenting in the chat boxes and grovelling for Crypto Boxes. 

I just came from there and the prize / reward of the hour was 0.001 BUSD split among a couple hundred people.  After waiting for 6 Minutes I ended up with 0.00009 BUSD or something. 

There are people who most likely spend their entire day there collecting these boxes.  I have been there on and off for the last couple months and I have a grand total of 0.02 USDT. Not sure what it is hourly but it’s probably 6 hours of collecting. 

It just makes me realize how little people value their time.

6/3/23,How DCAing turned my life around,"tl;dr at the bottom!

Hi everyone of /cc,

I wanted to share my personal 'crypto-journey' and becoming addicted, focusing on how DCAing (dollar-cost-averaging) transformed my approach to crypo/investing and ultimately gave me much needed peace of mind. Hopefully this can help others who may be struggling with or have struggled with similar challenges in the past!

**The beginning**

My journey began in 2017, where I bought my first $50 of Litecoin on binance after a friend told me about it. I believe KYC wasn't even a thing back then, so aquiring it was easy. I didn't understand anything about crypto, pretty sure I didn't even check the price of my investment at the time, not expecting it to have gained much in such a short time (surprise.. it did!), as I was used to 'normal' investing. After the crash the frequent news articles dissapearead, and my interest in the crypto space faded away with it.

**First bull run, becoming addicted**

Then 2021 came around, my first 'real' bull run. Bitcoin had just hit 30k and I remember reading about it somewhere, which prompted me to log back in to my dormant Binance account. I sold the Litecoin bought years ago for about $120 (taking profits, if only I realized how important this is) and began doing what I thought to doing 'research', which in reality mostly consisted of scouring Reddit and YouTube echochambers preaching high returns and claiming Bitcoin would go to around 100K. I remember investing in coins simply because I had read or heard positive things about them, without fully understanding the underlying projects.

Worst part is.. this worked, and I quickly made a very significant amount of unrealized profits, which in my mind was actual money that I owned. As a result of this, I got addicted to staring at charts all day, every day. I was obsessing over price movements, reading crypto related news, rumors, Reddit posts, etc. This behaviour became a habit, and I found it hard to step away from the ever changing market.

This continued for months on end, until I finally sold all my crypto after Bitcoin dropped from it's all-time-high to around 25K. I realized that this was not healthy or sustainable for me, spending so much time and energy on something that was out of my control. Unfortunately, my obsession with the crypto market also had a negative impact on my personal life. I missed out on spending time with friends and ruined a relationship due to my inability to set priorities.

**Recovery**

After realizing all this, I decided to take a step back from crypto. At first it was hard to resist the urge to constantly check the charts and obsess over short-term gains and losses, but things got easier as time went on. I took a hard break from crypto for a couple of months until late 2022, spending these months mostly reading and learning from my mistakes.

Around this time I got fascinated with blockchain technology in general. I also felt like I was educated enough to start accumulating again. Instead of trying to time the market, I started investing a small amount every week, and it has been one of the best decisions I've ever made for my mental and financial health.

**What DCAing did for me**

DCAing has helped me to avoid stress and anxiety of trying to time the market, while still allowing me to benefit from the potential growth of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology in the long term. Furthermore it has helped me to stay disciplined and set priorities, rather than getting distracted all the time. Five minutes a week is all I need nowadays!

Thank you for reading this far! This is just my personal experience, I hope that my story can be helpful/inspiring for others who may be struggling with similar issues, and that it can provide some insights for those who are new to the space.

**tl;dr**

Became addicted to crypto investing during the 2021 bull run, realized the negative impact it had on my mental health and personal life. After taking a break and educating myself I started DCAing. Best decision I ever made!

Would love to hear everyone elses experiences!"

6/3/23,American senators want to target Binance.,"A group of American senators [has requested](https://news.bitcoin.com/us-senators-probe-crypto-exchange-binance-potentially-illegal-business-practices/) documents from the cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and Binance US regarding ""potentially illegal business practices.""

# Do American senators want to target Binance? 

Senators Elizabeth Warren, Chris Van Hollen, and Roger Marshall sent a letter to Binance and Binance US this week, calling on both cryptocurrency exchanges to provide them with certain documents.

The letter was addressed to Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) and BAM Trading Services CEO Brian Shroder. It requests documents and answers to questions regarding ""finances, risk management strategies, and compliance operations."" The senators pointed to ""potentially illegal business practices"" that both companies may be responsible for.

It should be noted that Binance and its US branch, Binance US, are two separate entities. BAM Trading Services operates as Binance US.

Citing various media reports that suggest Binance may have violated the law, the senators wrote that the exchange and ""related entities deliberately evaded regulatory bodies,"" enabled funds transfers to criminals and individuals seeking to evade sanctions, and ""concealed fundamental financial information from its clients and the public.""

>""Your actions have called into question the legitimacy of your business operations and the safety of your customers' assets, and raised concerns about the potential impact of these actions on the stability of the cryptocurrency market and the broader financial system,"" the politicians emphasized.

The letter also noted that Binance hired the French auditing firm Mazars to conduct an audit confirming the exchange's reserves. However, the auditing firm ""removed the report"" from the network, which raises some concerns among regulators.

# The company has little time to respond 

The senators want to receive the requested documents and answers to questions by no later than March 16. They want to obtain ""complete copies of all Binance and Binance's subsidiary companies' balance sheets"" as well as the internal regulations and procedures of the companies regarding anti-money laundering (AML), counter-terrorism financing (CFT), and ""know your customer"" (KYC).

A copy of the senators' letter was sent to Gary Gensler, chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Rostin Behnam, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and Merrick B. Garland, US Attorney General at the Department of Justice (DOJ).

A few days ago, [Forbes published an article](https://bitcoin.pl/binance-2-mld-usd) suggesting that Binance transferred nearly $2 billion of its clients' funds without their consent. The company reportedly denies these allegations."
6/3/23,Don't lose focus on what Crypto can do for us.,"I live in Europe, my family lives in Latin America. I send them money every now and then, specially to my parents.

Some weeks ago my bank wouldn't let me use their app if I didn't answer what I use them for.
About a week ago, a brother of mine had a very big problem and I decided to send him some money to my mom's bank, today, knowing their situation, I decided to send some more... Gotta say that we are not even talking about big amounts, not even reaching 1K dollars (Euros here, but just to make it easier to understand) in total between both occasions. 

Well, today the bank decided that the money would not arrive until they made some so urgent stuff that can delay days, and then it'll depend on what they decide (possibly checking I'm not doing anything illegal, with my money that already paid taxes and I want to share with my family). Now they have a bad situation, and I have a lot of frustration and impotence, because being so far, I only help in the only way I can. And the amount is not even big, to be treated like a criminal, or a potential one.

Sadly they're too scared and ignorant about crypto to approach to it and they'll need me there to explain it to them personally.


This is not only a rant, It's a call to our community, yes, we all love to get gains, but let's not forget why crypto is so important aside from trying to go to the moon, who it can help, and What our role can be to help it get more adoption and usage."

A few projects have managed to gain in the ranks - **Polygon rocketed from 21st rank all the way to 8th**, DAI, and ATOM propelled themselves into the top 25 - BNB **overtook Tether for 3rd**, while **XRP gained 2 places in the rankings**. 

There are some clear **lunas**, excuse me - ***losers*** *as well in this bear market.*. **USDC** dropped from 5th to 10th in the rankings, while **Solana's** rank also fell dramatically from 5th to 11th.

Some coins simply refuse to move - with **Dogecoin stubbornly holding 9th**, and **Cardano** hovering between 6-7th rank.

Overall, I'm surprised to see that the top 25 looks as similar today as it did back then, sincee bear markets have a way of flushing projects down the drain. 

Hopefully somebody finds this interesting, was bored.

6/3/23,Bitcoin Miners Unfazed By ATH Difficulty As Hashrate Rises,
6/3/23,Singapore Starts an Investigation Against Terraform Labs (Report),
6/3/23,"Assessing the potential of moons: apples and oranges, or moons and bats","There has been a lot of speculation about the potential price of moons recently, and with good reason! Comparing moons to the mcap of SHIB, as seems popular, leads to hopium infused fever dreams of over $60 per moon. It would be nice to see, but I would suggest that a more appropriate project for comparison should be considered in the context of the evolving use cases of moons.

Something that stands out to me is the potential for the use of moons as a method of purchasing advertising in this sub by crypto projects. These moons are then exchanged, effectively, in return for the attention of users. Interesting, this seems very close to the model of monthly distributions of Brave Browser’s BAT. This token currently has a marketcap of just under $0.4 billion, and is just within the top 100 projects.

If we assume that this marketcap simply reflects the balance of advertising buy pressure and Brave users sell pressure (there are other factors of course) we can make a few inferences about a potential equilibrium of the buying and selling pressure of moons based upon audience size. 

Brave browser claims 19.3 million daily active users; while not all of these will be using and selling BAT, that is a substantial number. Trying to estimate the portion of users who use the Brave rewards system is tricky, as while we could check out the number of holders, the brave rewards are linked to exchange accounts, and therefore this number won’t truly reflect the number of users. Nonetheless, the number of holders gives us a hard minimum number of holders: 464,891 as of today. For moons this is 196,767. As moons are distributed directly to user wallets, and BAT is aggregated to exchange accounts, this will make the number of BAT holders appear fewer than reality. Despite this difference in distribution methods, we can conclude that at the very least there are 2.5x as moon BAT users as holders. I’d lean towards this multiple being much higher, so let’s explore a couple of scenarios. This also roughly seems aligned with brave having 3x as many daily users as this sub has members. There’s guesswork here as not all brave users will receive BAT, and also not every member of this sub is a daily user.

If we assume this give us a ballpark idea of the potential value of moons based upon a comparison with BAT, we can assume Brave offers advertisers a user base of at least 3x the amount of engaged users as in this sub. So we might expect moons could reach 33% of BAT’s mcap, for around an 130m mcap, or $1.22 per moon. Not too bad even in this scenario! 

If this comparison serves to give us a rough idea of how moons might be valued, then in a bullish environment, such as where BAT achieved a mcap of $2.5 Billion in November 2021, then if moons maintain the same ratio of active users relative to brave, then this might result in a moon mcap of $833 million, for $7.8 per moon. Now we’re talking! 

However, this does rely on the assumption that the crypto market will price a token proportionally to its utility, in this case the size of the user base that moons can be used to advertise to. This is just an attempt to guess at the value that one of the recently implemented use cases for moons might generate in terms of value. Do you think this comparison is a good place to start? I’d love to hear your thoughts! Perhaps there’s another token that would serve in place of BAT here!"
6/3/23,Friendly Reminder: Exchanges are not on our side when it comes to regulation,"Exchanges are in this market for one reason only: To profit off of your assets.

We need to keep this in mind as government regulations come to the forefront of this scene.  Exchange CEO's and other major crypto-offering companies are often seen as the spokespeople of our sector.  They will be arguing for the best interests of their companies to keep profiting off of you, not for your benefit or the betterment of crypto itself.  If exchanges lost their ability to serve as a custodian over your assets, they would not care which cryptocurrencies get listed as a security or argue for any improvements to the tax codes.

**Who/what do you think should be representing us when it comes to government hearings?**

It's a tricky question, as decentralized crypto is faceless and its viability comes down to each individual user.  For myself, I will not see crypto as a viable alternative to fiat until small transactions are no longer considered taxable events.  Tracking exchanges for groceries, gas, entertainment, etc. is a mess and takes a lot more effort than should be needed.  How can we make sure our voices are heard?"

6/3/23,Adoption - Can It All Be So Simple?,"The auto-Uber pulls up to the curb at Central Plaza and kicks into idle. I tap my pocket to make sure I am not leaving my keys behind and open the door. As is typical, the auto-Uber begins to roll away before I get a chance to close the door behind me. My corneal display flashes 0.0002 sats drained for the ride. I stare at the auto-Uber as it picks up speed on the way to the next fare with its door still slightly open. Those things are going to kill someone one day, I think to myself. Well, they already have. Just last week I downloaded news on 3 dead in an auto-Uber accident. Glitch in the navigation system, the article said. 

I turn towards Central Plaza and think of what I want to listen to for the walk to Starbucks. Raekwon’s *Only Built 4 Cuban Linx* queues up on command from my media wallet. It may be 40 years old at this point, but the album still bangs and the NFTs are getting more rare by the day. Ghostface’s machine gun vocabulary guides me past a couple of ‘versers sitting motionless outside on benches. Are they so ‘versed out that they can’t even feel how hot it is out here? There’s an air-conditioned world beneath us and they choose to ‘verse here? Scientists have been saying for years that it’s getting unsafe to stay outside for long periods of time, but I guess they are getting a little Vitamin D. 

My display dims when I step into the LED lights of the underground plaza and my body immediately tenses up to the latest notification. “brah, u got a couple sats to spare? Mike’s been hounding me for rent”. It could only be Benny. I told him to get his pay in sats long ago. He’s still on Digidollars but he’s had problems minting them ever since he got a little more vocal online about social issues. I’m not sure why he still trusts that stuff after the Fed cut the illegal immigrants off from earning a wage. Laziness. It’s definitely his laziness. I send him a few sats to get him by, with the message “no next time Benny”. Knowing Benny, there will be a next time. 

The Starbucks is half full and everyone is ‘versed out at their booths. Their slack jawed faces still creep me out but, after the last couple years of seeing ‘versers more out in the open, I’ve started to get used to it. I step up to the order kiosk and pause for a moment. Damn, D$400 for a coffee now? When did that happen? I paid half that for the ride over here! Reluctantly, I punch in my order and scan the payment QR with my retinal scanner. My corneal display flashes 0.0004 sats drained from my wallet. BTC price is low right now, I have to cut my spending, I remind myself. The Starbuck app on my cranial implant buzzes that my drink is ready as the auto-barista slides the tar filled cup towards me. 

I take a seat with my back towards the ‘versers. I can feel their eyes on me, but I know they don’t see me. It’s better than facing them. I take a sip of my coffee (exactly to spec as usual) and start checking some of the missed notifications on my display. A skin from my NFT collection sold on the Fortnite:Redux market last night. I sold it at a loss, but not by that much. I’m eyeing up a low mint first gen Solid Snake skin anyway so it will be a worthwhile trade if I can afford it. My display interrupts my thought. “New Moons Distribution (Round 180)”, it reads and I hurriedly open the post. I’m getting 0.76 MOONs this round! Nice. That’s about D$24,000 at today’s prices. I sit back contently, thinking of blasting fools tonight as Snake and take the last drag of my drink. Benny is a chore, but it’s been a pretty good start to the day otherwise."

I myself (and I am guessing I am not alone) have recently become interested in doing this so I did some learning and decided to make a post to talk about what this is, how it happens, and how you can minimize its impact. Keep in mind though, I am not a professional, this is just what I was able to learn. As always, DYOR.

Impermanent loss is a temporary loss that occurs when you provide liquidity to a pool of two crypto assets. It happens when the price ratio of the two assets changes compared to when you deposited them in the pool. The larger the price change, the more significant the loss.

For example (I’ll do my best), let's say you deposit 1 ETH and 1000 Moons to the ETH/Moon pool. Assuming that at this point, the price of 1 ETH = 1000 Moons. The pool will use an automated market maker (AMM) algorithm that maintains a constant balanced ratio of the two assets.

Now suppose that the price of 1 ETH increases to 2000 Moons on an external market. This creates an arbitrage opportunity for traders who can buy ETH cheaply from the exchange you are providing liquidity on and sell it at a higher price elsewhere. As more traders do this, they will drive up the price of ETH on your exchange. To maintain the constant ratio, your exchange will adjust the amount of ETH and Moons in the pool accordingly.

Eventually, when the price of ETH on your exchange reaches 2000 Moons, there will be no more arbitrage opportunity and the trading will stop. At this point, let's say there are 0.75 ETH and 1500 Moons left in the pool. If you withdraw your liquidity now, you will get back these amounts.

However, if you didn’t deposit your assets into the pool and kept them in your wallet instead, you would still have 1 ETH and 1000 Moons. But by withdrawing now, you only get back 0.75 ETH and 1500 Moons - a loss of value equivalent to 25% of your initial deposit of ETH. The opposite could also happen, where you would lose some of your initial investment of Moons instead.

It is called impermanent because it only exists when you withdraw your liquidity from the pool. If you keep your liquidity in the pool for longer and wait for the price ratio to return to its original state (or close enough), then your impermanent loss will decrease or disappear.

How Can You Reduce Impermanent Loss?

There are several ways to reduce or avoid impermanent loss when providing liquidity:

1) Choose pools with low volatility: If you expect that one or both of the assets in a pool will experience large price fluctuations over time (such as new or speculative tokens), then this will increase your risk of impermanent loss.

2) Choose pools with high fees: One way to compensate for impermanent loss is by earning fees from trading activity in a pool. The higher the fees are relative to volatility, the more likely you are to break even or profit from providing liquidity.

3) Choose pools with similar assets: Another way to reduce impermanent loss is by choosing pools that contain assets that have similar prices or correlations (such as stablecoins or wrapped tokens). This way, the price ratio between them will not change much over time, and thus your impermanent loss will be minimal.

4) Hedge your position: You can also use derivatives or other instruments to hedge against adverse price movements of one or both of the assets in a pool. For example, you could buy put options on ETH if you provide liquidity to an ETH/Moon pool, so that if ETH drops significantly, you can exercise your options and offset some of your losses. But this of course incurs its own risk and it is only advisable to do this if you really know what you are doing.

So, all in all, just know that the amount of crypto you put into a pool, might not be the same amount you get when you withdraw. And again, this is not professional financial advice and DYOR to know more."

6/3/23,Crypto owners trying to have it both ways with banks,"I hate to be that guy but I've seen several posts recently bemoaning banks for shying away from dealing with crypto businesses and clients. 


Listen, it's hypocritical for crypto owners to complain about traditional banks being hesitant in dealing with crypto because the very idea behind crypto currencies is to disrupt or replace traditional banking systems. If crypto advocates want to challenge the established financial system, they cannot simultaneously expect banks to embrace the disruptive technology—that's a suicide pact.


Banks have legitimate concerns about crypto's volatility, security, and regulatory compliance. It's silly for coin holders to demand that banks take on these risks and costs without also acknowledging the risks and challenges that come with crypto ownership and the existential threat that the success of crypto poses to banks. It feels like people expect to benefit from the technology, get the benefits of early stage disruption, but none of the consequences of digital assets."
6/3/23,"Remember when Solana and many other alts were called ""Ethereum-Killers""?","As soon as we had entered  bull run and saw some alts going up and doing good, like SOL, Dot, BNB, people had a little too much hope in these and went as far as calling them ""Ethereum-Killers"", thinking them to not only be match for Ethereum but worth enough to even do away with it. People saying this only encouraged others to believe, with no good reason to do so. 

When the bull run starts, it's best to not get caught up and it's best to look at things with logic rather than hope, and understand that there would have to be a coin that's a lot better than any of these to be able to even challenge Ethereum.



Solana has done very poorly, with the network having constant problems and the network going down, and every other ""Ethereum-killer"" has seen the same fate.  The truth is that historically, all the alts have fallen out of the Top 10 list and are very dangerous.  Higher returns of course, and less capital for them to go up, but risky. 

What do you think a coin would have to do better to actually kill Ethereum? Or can it lose it's place as the #2?"

Now imagine if it snow balls and we also see increased rate hikes by J Powell and his friends along with Binance becoming FTX 2.0. Now that would be BTC sub 10k material in my opinion.

So I am surprised by the fact that everything is so stagnant when it comes to XLM and why is no one talking about them since they are doing such a damn good job. In the end, besides hype projects(sadly), valuable projects should be between the first. What do you think about XLM, should they get more attention?

Steven Segal, a famous martial artist and actor in the 80s, and 90s, and known for his action movies, continued to self  produce movies after his career sank. All B-rated movies well into the late 2000s.  His action movies became so bad they actually started to become funny and somewhat entertaining...if you were high enough to watch one.


###Bitcoiin2Gen

This was an actual crypto..  yes. That's 2 👀 s you see in it's spelling.  I had to double check that one myself..

Despite his declining career, he still managed to become an ambassador for crypto called ""Bitcoiin2Gen"". 


###The Zen Master

The company referred to Seagal as a ""Zen Master"" in their marketing materials, which was presumably meant to lend credibility to the project and capitalize on Seagal's reputation as a martial artist and spiritual figure.

However, the use of the title ""Zen Master"" was criticized by some members of the Zen Buddhist community, who felt that it was inappropriate for Seagal to be using the title in a commercial context



Unfortunately, the company turned out to be a Ponzi scheme and defrauded investors of millions. Segal settled a lawsuit with the SEC by paying $314,000 in disgorgement and penalties and agreeing to not promote any securities for three years. Looks like even a zen master can't avoid the consequences of promoting fraud.


Now. Given the fact that Steven Segal genuinely believes his movies are gonna go 1000x in popularity like the shitcoins he buys into. Is he really just an idiot that thought he was involved In a real project or did he know it was a Ponzi scheme?"

6/3/23,I run a few businesses online and I would love to accept crypto.,"So it’s always nice to think a world of crypto being accepted everywhere. However that’s not a reality yet.

So as you saw by the title, I run some businesses online and I would love to accept crypto, problem is the website I use doesn’t allow crypto to be accepted. 

And it’s against the TOS to accept payment outside of the website. (To avoid people dodging the fees). 

However this is one of the reasons that I got into crypto, fees.

If I get a $500 sale, I know $70 to PayPal ish, and $10-20 for fees. That’s eaten up $70-90 of the money made, just for fees.

However if I accepted BTC then I would pay what $0.40 of gas? Heck I wouldn’t even pay gas, the person who is sending the BTC would. 

But the biggest issue is there’s no crypto paying service that doesn’t require kyc service that’s used to pay for good online. 

I know crypto.com pay, and bitpay exist but that’s a whole other issue. 

I know how early we are, but it’s a shame I can’t adopt crypto due to this issue.

Post-Merge stakers are issued about 1,700 ETH/day

This represents a **87% decrease** **in supply issuance.**

In addition,if an average gas price is at least 16 gwei for any particular day,  the \~1,700 ETH is offset such that ETH inflation is reduced to zero( or less) for that particular day.

And take a look at this chart.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/unpm4qd6f4ma1.png?width=1277&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7e1e30a880f0ee16fa021098e0fc2ea884d1b75c

It's a bit difficult to see but ETH has had average gas above 16 GWEI for the majority of the past 6 months.

Now, contrary to popular belief, Ethereum actually had a Proof of Stake Consensus layer, called the or the Beacon Chain, that ran with stakers all the way back in 2020, though it was in it's infancy. Additionally, these stakers did not validate transactions but were came validated the state on the this Consensus Layer itself. The other layer called the Execution Layer was the typical now-defunct PoW miner layer. Actually, it was called ""The Merge"" precisely because it ""merged"" these two layers into one PoS chain.

Let us compare these two layers pre-Merge and post-Merge.

## Pre-merge issuance

Issuance to miners: 4.09%

Issuance to stakers: 0.52%

**Total year issuance rate: \~4.61%**

# Post-merge

Issuance to stakers: 0.52%

**Total year issuance rate: \~0.52%**(There is now only one layer)

This puts the net reduction in issuance at around 87% as I stated above.

But post-Merge, 0.52% issuance does not account for burning. Burn rates fluctuate a lot and as it depends of factors like supply and demand and the types of operations done on the network. The London EIP-1559 upgrade had $10,000 every minute directly afterward.

We can calculate the average is an average of burn rates since the inception of the Burn Mechanism.

Annualized average burned ETH rate: **1.557%**

Remember prior, we have issuance at 0.52%. Really,

Net yearly issuance rate: **-1.03%**

or put another way, a *deflation* rate: **1.03%**

Remember this is an average rate since the Burn Mechanism was implemented in August 2021 to present, and this rate may be slightly higher or lower on any particular day.

In raw numbers, since the Merge the ETH supply has reduced by $68.6M.

&#x200B;

On the Network fundamentals side, the network has massively increased in efficiency.

The Average Block Time has fallen right off a cliff and the Average Block Size have have also increased.

Lower block time generally allows for more transactions per second and higher block size, somewhat similarly, allows for more transactions being processed at a time.

6/3/23,ISO 20022 The new world standard for payment transactions,"In Europe, everyone is currently talking about ISO 20022 due to the conversion of the Eurosystem and the conversion of SWIFT. In the coming years, the Eurosystem and SWIFT will convert the old MT formats for payment transactions to XML. At the same time, other major markets, such as the UK and the US, will also transition to ISO 20022. China, Japan and Switzerland have already switched. There are a total of over 200 initiatives in over seventy countries that have either already converted their payment systems to ISO 20022, are currently introducing them or are in the planning phase (see Figure 1). The developments show that by 2025 the majority of global payment traffic will have switched to the new standard and ISO 20022 will represent the universal standard for all global payment traffic in the long term.

What does this mean for the financial world?

The triumph of ISO 20022 began 20 years ago. The world of finance expects a lot from the new standard: unlimited expandability, more security and greater automation. In short: sustainability. When the migration is complete, many expect a host of new products and services.
Compared to the old MT formats, for example, the migration to XML brings with it a large number of structured fields and field contents, which are predestined for data analysis in the field of artificial intelligence and predictive analytics. For example, new insights into the customer and their products can be gained via combined analyzes of the ZV data. The expanded database of the ISO 20022 messages has proven to be particularly useful, especially in the area of know-your-customer (KYC) programs or to combat money laundering.

The new world standard ISO20022 would affect some cryptocurrencies, e.g. (xrp, Stella, etc.) what do you think how positively the course will be affected? Maybe it would be worth considering for some members to take certain coins into their portfolio. The full implementation should be completed in 2025."

6/3/23,"Could there ever be a physical representation of BTC, or any crypto for that matter? Like a banknote, but for crypto.

For example, if there were extreme amounts of solar activity over the course of a few years, to an extend we have never seen before. To me, this seems like cryptos biggest weakness right now. And, this got me thinking about a physical version of BTC.  

Could there ever possibly exist a physical version of crypto? Similar to a banknote, but with a QR code or something printed on it to link it back to the blockchain. Or would it have to be some sort of smart device embedded with RFID or something along those lines?  If so, who would be able to issue these items, and how could they be redeemed? 

I understand that the world would have a lot of other problems if the internet were to go down, but this is just a hypothetical situation that I've been thinking about. Does anyone else every think about this scenario? Curious to hear some other peoples opinions on this."

6/3/23,There are Millions of dollars in BTC completely unaccounted for on the network.,"The network automatically handles transactions and rounds them up or down to the nearest Satoshi (SAT).  Whichever way up or down doesn't matter.  It means that there is some fractions of SATs left unaccounted for after gas fees are applied. 

###UTXOs

These discarded fractions or ones left unclaimed in unspent transaction outputs are known as (UTXOs).

Over time, these UTXOs accumulate and clog up the blockchain, increasing transaction fees and slowing down the network. To address this issue, some Bitcoin wallets and exchanges have implemented ""dust sweeping"" mechanisms that consolidate small UTXOs and reduce the amount of unspendable dust on the network.

This still doesn't fix the problem of UTXOs that take place during the transaction because of gas fees being applied for which in itself create fractions of Satoshi's after the dust was gathered up and cleared from the wallet.

As of now, 1 Sat is worth $0.0002243 USD

1 penny is worth
44.5831475702 SATS

A $10 fee applied for gas as an example would subtract that worth from your BTC.  Since 1 penny worth of BTC leaves us with a fraction of SAT, you now have a UTXO that can't be claimed by anyone.    So where is it going?  The network doesn't have its own wallet that accounts for the exact amount of UTXOs to date. 

Instead it is represented in data structures that get added to the size of the blockchain further slowing down the network.

 ##Over 1.6 billion transactions to date

With this many transactions, there could be millions of dollars in BTC unaccounted-for micro fractions of SATs floating around on the network in data structures.

6/3/23,Stablecoins are flowing into exchanges. Are buyers building positions?," Stablecoins are flowing into centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, which may be a signal that buying pressure will soon increase.

On March 6th, the analytical firm CryptoQuant reported that stablecoins are flowing into exchanges in significant amounts.

Furthermore, the company reported ""the highest level this year."" Stablecoin balances on cryptocurrency exchanges sharply increased on March 5th.

According to analysis, the price of Bitcoin has fallen in the short term, but the ""potential buying power of the cryptocurrency market is growing.""

When stablecoins flow into exchanges, it usually signals that investors may be preparing buy orders at current or lower levels.

Ethereum dominates stablecoin share However, this data contradicts Glassnode's recent findings. The analytical firm noted that the average number of addresses receiving USDC has just reached a one-month low of 1544 per hour.

Nevertheless, the average transaction volume of USDT has just hit a monthly peak.

Glassnode [added](https://twitter.com/glassnodealerts/status/1632565542606217219) that the average number of BTC deposits on the exchange is also at a monthly low. This strengthens the belief that investors are currently preferring to hold and accumulate rather than sell.

Also on March 6th, CoinGecko reported that Ethereum maintains its dominance in stablecoin market share.

Ethereum is the leader in the stablecoin market with a large margin, holding 60% of the total share. TRON is the second-largest network for stables with a 27% share, up 5.9%. Binance's BNB Chain is in third place with a 7% market share.

# Stablecoins are flowing and their ecosystem remains stable 

Stablecoins currently account for about 12.7% of the entire cryptocurrency market. According to CoinGecko, the total market capitalization of all stablecoins is approximately $136 billion.

The market leader, Tether, has a share of about 52% with $70 billion in circulation. In addition, Tether's supply has increased by 7.8% since the beginning of the year, as an additional $5 billion USDT was issued.

Circle's USD Coin has just under $44 billion in circulation, giving it a 32% market share. Circle began reissuing coins in mid-February, adding approximately $3 billion USDC since then.

The supply growth came at the expense of Binance and BUSD. Since the SEC took action against BUSD issuer Paxos, its circulating supply has dropped by 46%. Currently, there are $8.7 billion BUSD in circulation, giving it a 6.4% market share."

6/3/23,Crypto’s Future Success Depends On Its Success In Developing Countries,"I don’t want this to be a long post.

I’m just thankful for my cryptocurrency investments right now, despite the market being down so much. I’m from a country that has, over the last year, devalued it’s currency by nearly 100%. Somehow… investing in crypto in 2021-22 has helped *preserve* the value of my assets.

I think the message is clear.

If you live in a country that borrows in a currency other than its own, your money and wealth are, effectively, at the mercy of the people who run your nation’s economy, US interest rates, geopolitical tensions, and investor sentiments towards investing in emerging market debt.

That’s why the key to wider crypto adoption actually lies in the developing world — not in the United States, Europe, and Australia.

Research indicates that [10.34% of Africa’s](https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-nigeria-2022/) most populous country (Nigeria) own cryptocurrencies.

This shouldn’t be surprising considering that Nigeria’s fiat currency depreciated by over 200% in the last six years.

Oftentimes it’s not the value proposition of a new innovation that drives its adoption, but the economic hardship and desperation for alternatives."

What is the usual cycle? Now that most crypto are down, I guess bitcoin will go in a bull run first  and then I will be followed by altcoin going up. Is that the general consensus??

I’m asking cause before the drop, I took half my bitcoin to invest into some altcoin like BNB, ATOM, ETH, AXS, SOL, NEAR. This was good for a time but now my total bitcoin (btc equivalent) fell down cause those altcoin dropped more than the btc

So I’d like to know if it’s worth it to wait or if I should sell most of my coin (except ETH) to buy back into BTC since I believe more in this than the other"

6/3/23,Are crypto liquidity pool incentives ponzis?,"So I get that owners of crypto tokens contributing to a liquidity pool is good for traders and the dex that’s offering it - and it’s appropriate for the owners of those crypto tokens to therefore get a slice of the trading fees so this post isn’t about trading fee rewards. 

But, what I don’t get is when the project themselves offer an additional incentive (such as free tokens, for example) on top of the share of trading fees for being in a liquidity pool. Because that’s funded by the project - and by definition it’s being funded by token holders in that project who aren’t selling. Which seems like ponzinomics to me. 

Is there any legit reason for offering project-funded incentives for liquidity pools?"
6/3/23,I see PayPal is advertising and offering crypto services. Why can’t I use PayPal to pay in crypto?,"PayPal is always advertising that I can buy crypto on their app and cash app does the same. What I don’t see is the ability to pay with crypto. I’m not sure I even believe they’re working toward that function. I think it’s safe to assume they’re making money off of arbitrage and are happy enough doing only that.

However, if it were to really come true fruition that these apps were functional and using crypto as payment for retail in basic similar use cases, that would be significant.

I’ll be reaching out to PayPal and yes I realize I probably won’t get anybody on the phone or in any kind of help chat… Perhaps we need one of those petitions on change.org?  Just kidding they would probably delete it.  Maybe not.

I mean if I was able to buy things using PayPal crypto I could do it on Etsy where I support local and smaller sellers.  I have friends who run businesses like that - let’s say they sell soap and T-shirts - the main issue for them is they need everything to jive with their Quickbooks app and of course at the end of the day they want fiat to pay the bills.

In closing, it isn’t the big banks we need to persuade.  It is, in my opinion, PayPal and other apps like it."

6/3/23,Why do all these crypto twitter-youtube influencers still exist?,"I've been thinking about this for a while and I understand that there are a lot of people who don't have enough knowledge about crypto (like me) or they blindly follow anyone who says that ""it's easy to trade crypto and get $1000/day"", but I still surprised that these ""influencers"" are still active and have a huge audience. 

It feels like people don't get it, because a lot of these guys say bitcoin will go up tomorrow and when they are wrong, they just ignore it and say - NOW it will go up and they do it until it will go up to say ""I told you so. 

If you look at all these posts you will see that they are wrong almost all the time and try to hide it to save this rich trader reputation. And people still follow their advice and believe them. 

Most of these traders don't really earn money from crypto, they promote some scam projects or exchanges. And that's the second point of this post. 

There are so many influencers like bitboy that act like a crypto god or the CEO of bitcoin and promote scam projects like FTX and stuff and THEN when the sh\*t goes down they pretend that this doesn't happen. Bitboy literally acts like he is the only reason SBF got caught. 

So my question is this - if people are more aware of crypto/ bitcoin and all these scams, why they are giving power to these influencers to earn more money and scam more people? 

And despite us having a strong and smart crypto community, why can't we win over ""influencers"" by showing people that they are all fake and lie all the time? We just literally need to who facts to do that. 

My opinion is that these Twitter and youtube people are turning the crypto community into a freak show and people treat it less seriously because of that."

Some examples may be similar, would be nice if people could come up with more examples in the comments.

&#x200B;

1. Undercollateralized or variable rate lending. Borrower reputation can be established via private data such as credit history. Those with a good reputation can get loans using less collateral and/or loans with lower interest rates.
2. MEV-resistant DEXs. Important aspects of orders such as slippage parameters can be kept private from even the nodes themselves, preventing them from manipulating orders and/or frontrunning. This allows users to keep more of the value of their trades.
3. Privacy-preserving decentralized identity. Also called anonymous credentials. This could allow people to, for example, satisfy KYC/AML laws without revealing their entire identity to everyone. This can also allow dApps to screen users based on e.g. age or country.
4. Confidential NFTs. The owner of an NFT gains access to private data such as an image. This could be used to enhance the value of owning an NFT since not every aspect of the token is available publicly.
5. Confidential voting. This could be especially useful for DAOs. It allows for votes to be held in which voters are not influenced by the votes that were submitted before them.
6. Collaborative analytics. For example, multiple companies or individuals could pool their data and perform a privacy-preserving analysis whose results are only shared within a certain audience. Since data is only analyzed within a TEE, there is less chance for a data leak.
7. Games with hidden on-chain state. Example: puzzle games in which there is an answer that must be kept from the player. Another example: Games in which players act on information that cannot be revealed to other players.
8. Games that rely on random number generation. Oasis can use TEEs to generate random numbers without an external oracle. Gambling games could make use of this (rolling a die). RPGs could incorporate this as well.
9. An info leak marketplace. Leakers can upload private information. The leaker can choose to sell it to one, several, or many people. They can also set a fundraising threshold past which they will reveal the secret to everyone. Leaker's reputation can be based on ratings.
10. Proof-of-humanity. A privacy-preserving user verification system can be implemented that proves a user is human based on uploaded ID documents or attestations from trusted institutions/companies. This could be useful on any dApp that wants to exclude bots.

Hopefully, this has been helpful to some people in understanding why private smart contracts are the most important thing to get right in the next few years. Important to note is that most of the ideas presented can only be implemented with TEEs."
6/3/23,is DYOR less effective today then what it used to be?,"In the world of cryptocurrency, there's a popular saying: ""DYOR"", which stands for ""Do Your Own Research"". This phrase is often used by experienced crypto enthusiasts to remind newbies that they need to do their homework before investing in any crypto project.

Without proper research, it's easy to fall for scams, make poor investment decisions, and ultimately lose money - or so could be said at least till a few years ago. So, is DYOR still as effective today as it used to be a few years ago?  


Let's take an example of r/CryptoMoonShots, a few years ago, it was a sub where you could actually find some decent projects. (I found ATOM there).  


This is how that sub looks today  


https://preview.redd.it/cd2471iua4ma1.png?width=1290&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9367e00f1feaf905ea3d875bfe11e7a67bad2eb4

There are  a few factors that you can look for before investing in a new project  


1. Project team: Research the background of the project team and make sure they have relevant experience in the crypto industry or related fields. Look for their LinkedIn profiles, social media accounts, and any news articles about their previous work.
2. Whitepaper: Read the project's whitepaper thoroughly and ensure it's well-written and provides a clear and realistic vision for the project. Look for technical details and explanations about how the project will function.
3. Community engagement: Check the project's social media channels, there should be actual thoughtful discussions (Like Vitalik does) rather than just hype and shilling.
4. Codebase: If the project has open-source code, you can see if it's well-maintained and up-to-date. You can see when the last push was done, and if they are regularly fixing bugs?
5. Red flags: Be wary of any projects that promise unrealistic returns, have an anonymous team, lack transparency, or use aggressive marketing tactics. These are often signs of a potential scam. (those high APRs are always a scam)

&#x200B;

Finding decent projects is still, tough, and chances of you catching your moon shot is incredibly super low today.  For the same reasons, I avoid research in new projects altogether and DCA small quantities into BTC and ETH regularly because they are not going anywhere any time soon."

I was astonished when I found out that everyone here could earn some crypto by participating in this community. So here I share some tips that I have been doing to increase financial gains passively through crypto.

1. **Staking**. This one seems pretty obvious, stake the cryptos than can be staked natively or enter the DeFi world if you like risks, I guess we all do since we are in crypto lol.
2. **Card Cashback**. Everyone is against CEX because we all know how things can end, but still there are good offers like spending, in my case, with the Binance Card and earn some BNB in the process.
3. **Share internet connection**. Use some platform to earn some dollars at the end of the month by sharing your internet connection while you spend time in reddit. For example I have been using honeygain and the rewards can be retrieved in the form of crypto.
5. **Brave Browser**. You can earn some BAT while browsing privately with this amazing browser.
4. **DCA**. If it has not been said enough in this sub, Dollar-Cost Averaging is the way. No one can beat the market.
5. **HODLing**. I am no expert here but HODL is the one true simplest strategy. Just hold your crypto and wait till you see your neighbour talking about some digital currency named bitcoin, then and there you will know we are in the bull market and it's time to sell.
6. **Participate in this sub**. No explanation needed :)

Do you have some tips about how to earn more crypto in this amazing crypto space?

https://kryptoradio.koodilehto.fi/

""Kryptoradio is a Bitcoin transport system which allows users and machines to keep track of their account balances without Internet connection just by listening to the Digital TV broadcast. Also, the broadcast can be used to make Bitcoin network more resistant to cyber attacks because it is difficult to shut down the Bitcoin P2P network and the broadcast simultaneously.""

""Finnish quasi-national cryptocurrency FIMKrypto has struck a partnership deal with Koodilehto, a Finnish software company, in order to launch world’s first development project that aims to broadcast cryptocurrency transactions through national TV broadcast networks in real time.

The technology, coined Kryptoradio, enables merchants and consumers to receive real time P2P network transaction data with any standard Digital TV device and custom software without the requirement of Internet or mobile network connection.

The broadcast transaction data consists of Bitcoin and FIMKrypto transactions, which are encoded and forwarded to the network of Digita, the Finnish national terrestrial TV operator. The broadcast covers 95% of the Finnish territory of approximately 5 million people. The technology, once completed, will be portable to other countries worldwide.""

6/3/23,"Binance: The Good, The Bad and the Ugly","The Bad:

1. The US Justice Department were investigating Binance since all the way back in 2018. Binance (allegedly) used various methods to avoid US regulations through a shell company.
2. They also allegedly intentionally transacted and alleged $10 Billion for users who were ""criminals"" or sanctioned entities. \[Unclear if they were only criminals according to US law or if other countries laws were broken as well\].
3. Binance are currently facing allegations for misappropriating user funds and misleading customers, leaving their assets heavily exposed to the tune of well over $1 Billion.
4. The SEC objects Binance's attempt to acquire Voyager(or what is left of their assets).
5. Binance faces strong allegations of an FTX-like move where $1.8 Billion in collateral related to user assets was sent a number of hedge funds and individuals, which includes Tron founder Justin Sun and SBF's now-collapse Alameda Research. Basically, customer funds that were supposed to be collateralized,  weren't.
6. Binance(and affiliates) has operated in jurisdictions without licenses for which they have many many charges and warnings. This includes countries like Japan, UK, Malaysia, South Korea, among others.

The Good:

1. Binance do legitimately have licenses in many jurisdictions.
2. Binance is ridiculously large with well over 50% market share. Frankly, outside of actual large-scale fraud and a real heavy concerted efforts by a large consortium of nations to stop them, a failure due to a bank run(or exchange run i.e. mass withdrawals) is highly unlikely.
3. Binance seems to offer satisfactory services to most customers such that most are satisfied enough to stay and continue using their services.
4. Outside of murky BNB chain protocols and coin activities, the exchange itself appears to at least have the vast majority of user assets backed.
5. Binance *appears* to have to insurance measures in case of some unfortunate/unexpected circumstance.

The Ugly:

1. Especially for US citizens, there is a chance Binance US customer assets may be frozen or otherwise ""locked up"" due to some legal engagement by government action whether it is warranted or not.
2. With a roughly 66% market share, Binance wields significant influence over the entire market, whether or not you believe they will abuse it.
3. CZ himself said that you shouldn't trust any exchange who shifts funds around with no notice to users, but Binance themselves were found to have moved $2.7 Billion out of a wallet that was part of their proof of reserves ""report""/attestation with 24 hours of publishing it.
4. While CZ in no way was responsible for FTX's fall, it is uncomfortable to see how heavily Binance has capitalized on the situation(some even say exploited it). They gobbled up market share, invested in hard wallet maker NGRAVE when everyone rushed to self-storage, were set to acquire Voyager from FTX's hands after FTX fell out of the picture and were champions of PoR, which they themselves failed to adequate provide.
5. BSC is a heavily centralised chain with a lot of the operation of the tech still murky. Binance do a fairly poor job at documenting its network especially compared to Ethereum.
6. Binance ran Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU) Insurance Fund that was 44% backed by their own BNB token.
7. Binance owns the popular crypto information aggregator CoinMarketCap which they claim is independent. However, the exchange information and rankings data are *heavily* skewed to favour Binance and drive more market share to them.
8. While they were likely just the last straw from a pile, Binance was likely the (final) reason for the huge auditors in Mazars( and Amarino) leaving the crypto space. This is because Binance's now-deleted audited PoR attestation only covered 14% of their total assets. However, the miniscule asset coverage was not made known in the report itself and could only be discovered through extensive digging and conversions.

6/3/23,Binance to end all staking earn offerings in UK from end of April 2023,"I'm assuming everyone else who uses Binance in the UK has received the same notification today :

***Snip***
2023-03-06 13:59:33

We are writing to notify you that new subscriptions to the following products are no longer be available in your region, and redemption of existing subscriptions will be as follows: 

- Liquidity Farming: you can redeem and withdraw your liquidity before 08:00 (UTC) on 31 March 2023. Thereafter, your deposits in the liquidity pools will be automatically redeemed to your spot wallet, and calculated based on the prevailing composition ratios of the pool. Please be reminded that all liquidity farming positions are exposed to changes in composition ratios due to the nature of liquidity pools. 

- Flexible Simple Earn, Flexible DeFi staking and BNB Vault: the digital assets you used to subscribe will be returned to your spot wallet, together with any accrued rewards, at 08:00 (UTC) on 28 April 2023. 

- Locked Simple Earn and Fixed DeFi-staking: the digital assets you used to subscribe will be returned to your spot wallet, together with any accrued rewards, at the end of their respective subscription terms as usual.
***Snip***

For me, it looks like anything in locked staking and flexible staking will be heading back into spot wallet, so no more yield

:(

Is this in effect in any other geos or just the UK ?

At least they gave advanced notice this time

So I guess this is the final push to self custody, since if there's not any yield there's no point in leaving any crypto on a CEX if I'm just HODL'ing

Any idea what sparked this ?

Fallout from the stablecoin investigation perhaps ?

Good luck everyone"

There's really no sense in timing a market this illogical. We could have the best news and the price will tank or we could have another pandemic around the corner which may result the biggest pump. It's simply near impossible to know what's gonna happen.

Get in now, little by little if you have to. $20 will do, $20 per week will do, $20 per month will do. You'll thank yourself later. A lot of people were waiting for these prices a year. Last year BTC is in 35-40k range and people are desperately asking for lower prices in the 20s, well here we are now. Where are they? They just left off after being scared of the very thing they were asking for. If you're still here despite the ""boring"" movement then you're probably still hopeful. 

Stack up right now. Don't be the exit liquidity that you were last bull run 2 years ago. People buying now will be the ones looking for exit liquidity, which exactly are the ATH buyers next bull run."

So, pretty irritating but there you go - I don't suppose they have strong feelings one way or the other, but are future proofing re. possible laws & regulations.

Edit: Since this has come up in comments a bit - they didn't shut them down instantly. They've given me 2 months to move, but the accounts are shutting down at that point. My apologies for any confusion."

6/3/23,One year ago the Swiss city of Lugano adopted Bitcoin as a “legal tender“. Today it is one of the most successful crypto mass adoptions.,"About a year ago we also were at the very beginnings of a brutal bear market but that did not stop any mass adoptions for Crypto even on the bigger scale. On the 3rd March 2022 it was announced during the Plan B event that the city of Lugano in Switzerland will adopt Bitcoin, USDT and LUGA (CHF stablecoin) as their legal tender. This was a move to transform the city into a blockchain hub.

&#x200B;

[Article form CoinTelegraph](https://preview.redd.it/654sm8kox5ma1.jpg?width=986&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=140d907b4f43658917629b60fc5fa4b5039de891)

Now roughly one year, citizens in Lugano were able to buy their everyday needs and even pay taxes in Bitcoin. It was even possible to pay at McDonalds and other fast-food chains with Bitcoin. As of November 2022, 60 merchants in Switzerland started accepting Crypto payments.

&#x200B;

Even El Salvador due to that had begun a close relationship with Lugano and other Switzerland officials to promote Crypto adoption.

This is definitely one of the best crypto mass adoptions there have been and hopefully we will se more adoption where it will actually be used on a daily active base, that is the best kind of mass adoption."
6/3/23,What's the best coin to accumulate from Curve crypto rewards?,"Hey all, I've just sprung for a Curve Black subscription, and it comes with Curve cashback. Amongst other things, it means I'll accumulate 1% more cashback at grocery stores and on my daily train journey. I've just noticed that it comes with the option to earn these rewards in crypto, and I'm debating the best direction to take with this. 

From Curve's website, there are ten coins for me to choose from: Aave (AAVE), Bitcoin (BTC), Cardano (ADA), Ethereum (ETH), Chainlink (LINK), Litecoin (LTC), Polkadot (DOT), Solana (SOL), Uniswap (UNI), Stellar (XLM).

I have two questions: (1) has anyone got any experience using the Curve crypto rewards system and any advice, and (2) what coins do you recommend that I accumulate?

Obviously, I considered BTC and ETH, but I've already got some of these, and the cashback isn't going to be life-changing money so was planning to DCA separately into these. That being said, is it worth maximising how much I'm holding of these bags, or is this the time to choose another coin that might have greater potential to rise next bull? And if so, which coins do you recommend?"
6/3/23,"One of the worst things in a bull market is the mentality of “But it could go lower…“. In the past, many have missed out on generational wealth opportunities due to this.","While my general belief is that a bear market is actually the easiest market form in contrast to a bull market (if you only invested as much you could afford to, in the first place), it is true that even there are a few smaller hurdles before you actually succeed in it. Which is obvious as you wont be served some easy profits just a plain plate but there is still some work to do.

One of that is to not fall prey for some mentalities such as “I am not buying right now because it could still go lower“. Being honest, all of us must have had that thought at one point because of us simply being sentient beings that want the maximum pleasure which here would be the maximum gains.

But this kind of emotions have never really helped anyone and only made most miss out on what could have been a “generational wealth opportunity“ or as you could say a very cheap price.

This is one of the many charts that show how relatively low the price is creating an opportunity to buy that only occurs a few times in a whole decade. Whether the chart is right or not is completely irrelevant, the fact is that the prices of last year and even today are extremely low.

The key to success here is to not listen to your emotions but follow a clear plan, may it be DCA or just occasional accumulation at lower prices. Hesitations have usually just lead to people FOMOing back in at higher prices."
6/3/23,Dormant Ethereum Whale Moves Millions Amid Silvergate Bank Controversy,"**TL;DR Breakdown**

* A dormant Ethereum wallet, inactive for 5 years, has transferred  over 10,000 ETH to an unknown destination amid the Silvergate Bank  outage.
* This move has fueled speculation about the intentions of the  mysterious wallet owner and its potential impact on the Ethereum market.

The crypto world has been abuzz with news of an ancient Ethereum wallet that has been dormant for more than five years. The wallet suddenly shifted 10,200 ETH tokens, worth approximately $30 million, sparking concerns of an impending Ethereum price dump. The wallet’s activity coincided with the recent Silvergate bank  debacle, which has caused investors to speculate about a possible  correlation.

The fact that this wallet has been inactive for five years and has  now moved millions of dollars worth of Ethereum has sparked speculation  and discussion about its origins and potential impact on the market. As  the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, such movements from  dormant wallets and whales will undoubtedly continue to be closely  followed by traders and investors.

## Dormant Wallet Resurfaces, Sending Shockwaves Through the Crypto Market

On March 1, 2023, an Ethereum wallet that had been inactive for more  than five years came back to life. The wallet, which was created on  November 18, 2017, and has been inactive ever since, suddenly  transferred 10,200 ETH tokens, worth approximately $30 million at the  time of transfer. The wallet’s activity was noticed by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode, which tweeted about the event, causing a frenzy among investors.

The sudden transfer of the 10,000 ETH highlights the ongoing  volatility in the cryptocurrency market. It also serves as a reminder of  the significant impact that a single whale can have on the market. The  market is highly sensitive to any significant movements, with a single  large transfer having the potential to cause a dip in the market’s  price.

The Ethereum  community is now trying to figure out who the owner of the wallet is  and why they suddenly decided to move such a large amount of ETH tokens.  The move has caused panic among some investors who fear that the sudden  influx of tokens into the market could lead to a significant price  drop.

## Silvergate Bank Debacle Fuels Speculation

The wallet’s activity coincided with the recent Silvergate bank  debacle, which has caused investors to speculate about a possible  correlation. Silvergate Bank is a leading bank for cryptocurrency  exchanges, and its recent announcement of a data breach has sent  shockwaves through the crypto market. The breach compromised the bank’s  security systems and exposed the personal information of thousands of  customers.

The breach has raised concerns about the security of cryptocurrency  exchanges and wallets, and some investors believe that the dormant  wallet’s sudden activity may be related to the Silvergate bank breach.  Others speculate that the wallet belongs to a whale that has been  waiting for the right moment to cash out its holdings.

## Conclusion

The sudden activity of the dormant Ethereum wallet has sent  shockwaves through the crypto market, and investors are scrambling to  determine the owner’s identity and the reason for the large transfer.  The move has fueled speculation about a possible correlation with the  recent Silvergate bank debacle, which has raised concerns about the  security of cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets.

It remains to be seen whether the sudden influx of ETH tokens into  the market will lead to a significant price drop or whether the move was  made by a savvy investor who believes that the price of Ethereum is  about to surge. In the meantime, the Ethereum community is holding its  breath, waiting for the next move from the ancient Ethereum whale.

6/3/23,Why do I think this is the Most Important bear market of all time,"Let me start with this: We are on the verge of mass adoption

The crypto market has changed in so many ways since its inception that it's hard to analyze every factor.

I will keep it simple:

Let me give you an analysis of how Bitcoin ATH behaved compared to previous ATH or the last 3 bull runs.

And in simple terms, we will see how the overall crypto market cap has grown during the last 3 bull runs.

**Let's start with BTC**

https://preview.redd.it/4fn6h8mlx2ma1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5bc10934bba27489e4f293c39d30e1c9b57376c9

As we can see that ATH comes almost after 4 years and the growth pattern is not fixed. It has jumped from 1K to 19K to 69K where the ratio does not matter, but we can safely assume that the crypto market gives an ATH after 4 years in November or December month. Hopefully, we will see bulls running around in Nov-Dec 2025.

How much BTC will be worth? We don't know but one thing is certain it always surpasses its last peak.

**Now Overall Crypto Market Cap:**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yeyv7ubkx2ma1.png?width=1283&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=28d385ab0c5edf528920979dd8ccbdd2e69d4bf1

29 November 2013 - **$13 Billion** Market Cap

16 December 2017 - **$604 Billion** Market Cap

10 November 2021 - **$3 Trillion** Market Cap

When people say what about adoption, I think we already broke the mindset about crypto and it became a household name during 2020-2021. Awareness is one of the biggest challenges when you are trying to tell people how shiny the new thing is. And we have achieved it as people now know about bitcoin and crypto in general.

**The Next 2 Big Things:**

* ***Trusting Crypto Industry***
* ***Then Adoption will come in***

**Why do I think that this bear market is the most important one and the next bull run will be crazy?**

* My guess is that though most people might not have an active account on DEX or CEX or might hold crypto, they did notice it because crypto was everywhere.
* The next step will be mass adoption because people are aware of it or heard of it and the only thing that is left is to experience it
* New technologies are and will evolve around blockchain
* Some new concepts will pop up in the next bull run
* Crypto will cross paths with AI
* BTC may grow 3-10 times from the last ATH and the overall crypto market cap may cross or match the Gold market cap
* Most financially healthy countries are now talking about introducing laws around crypto

If those things happen which I think are very much possible, then you can see that the crypto market cap is and will be larger than most financial institutions where they are traded.

Here is a simple reflection on market cap:

**NYSE:** ***$22 Trillion***

**Gold:** ***$12.2 Trillion***

**NSE:** ***$3.4 Trillion***

**Euronext:** ***$3.3 Trillion***

**London Stock Exchange:** ***$2.8 Trillion***

We already touched the $3 Trillion market cap in the last bull run and currently hover around $1trillion

&#x200B;

[Depreciation Inflation rate is directly proportioned with Growing BTC Price](https://preview.redd.it/ffzqeywnx2ma1.png?width=813&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9d4f396cf6f2be48a9a936b0b33128cc8a1f0de5)

So I think that after this bear market, adoption will take place and the volatility will decrease. Crypto will be watched, traded, and achieve stagflation.

And it will become less volatile and will behave like the stock market. But the normal daily movement will be around 3-4% higher when compared to conventional stocks and indexes.

This is the last big wave - The last call for the ride or else you will have to ride on the low tide from the next cycle."

This usually leads to a huge pump, then a huge dump, right? For example, I heard some stuff about coins with prices that went up 3000 times after being promoted by a celebrity. 

If we just hear about a coin being promoted by a celebrity, wouldn't it be easy profit to just buy a lot of the coin, then sell after a few times profit and watch as the dump happens after you sell everything with lots of profit? If the coin has already soared, probably too late, but if it hasn't, then wouldn't it just be simple to buy, sell at the peak, then profit?

I've always wanted to ask this, sorry if this is a stupid question."

6/3/23,Could posting photos and images on r/CC fall under commercial use?,"This isn't a serious or a very important of a question, and was more of just a random thought, but I was curious and couldn't find a clear or definite answer.

It's not that often that I see photos of people on this sub, but if the photos have a person in them, and the images aren't in public domain (posted on social media doesn't count as public domain, the author still owns copyright), then you need to follow [these](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Country_specific_consent_requirements) laws per country (Almost all require consent for commercial use). And if you were posting them in this sub with the intention of getting moons to sell for profit, could that fall under commercial use? Because Moons are technically a governance token but if you were posting with the intention of profit would it still count? Because that would require there to be written consent from the subject(s) in the photo, and you would need permission from the copyright holder. And the copyright owner could sue you or you could get in trouble.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Posting photos without the subjects and copyright owners consent might be commercial use and depending on the country could require permission that you wouldn't need with regular publishing.

Please correct me if I said something wrong, Apart from where I said ""could"", ""would"", or ""should"", I'm pretty sure I got it right."

6/3/23,Why does decentralization of finance actually matter?,"From what I've gathered, decentralization means that power is distributed across a network of users rather than held by a single authority like a bank or government. This seems like it could be a good thing, but I'm not entirely clear on the benefits. I've heard that it offers greater security, transparency, and autonomy, but I'm not sure how that works in practice. 

I've come across people who are hellbent on going against coins like XRP as cryptocurrency was created for the opposite reason but why actually care when 99.9% of the people in cryptocurrency right now are probably only in it for the money.


So my question is, why does decentralization of finance actually matter? What advantages does it offer over traditional finance, and how does it impact our daily lives?"
5/3/23,"Don’t rely on the halving, or the Fear-Greed Index, or anything else to advise you. Bitcoin may never reach its peak again.","It is entirely possible that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and any other coin may never reach their 2020-2021 peak again.

Throughout cryptocurrency’s entire existence thus far, our greater economic market has been a more-or-less consistent bull market, with the obvious boom happening in 2020-2021. Bitcoin had a halving in March of 2020, but is that what fueled the huge price boom?

I posit that the halving only played a small role, and the real reason was because of the money printer. I feel like this should be wildly obvious to everyone, but I also see people posting every day about the upcoming halving, or the fear-greed index, or the rainbow chart, or some other nonsensical thing as reasons to be bullish on the price of Bitcoin.

As soon as the COVID lockdowns went into effect, the money printer was turned on. This wasn’t just giving regular people those tiny stimmy checks - money was flying everywhere in the markets and found it’s way largely into the hands of…dun dun dun…big corpos, banks, and hedge funds. Speculative investing was all the rage. Even in the regular stock market, it didn’t matter if your business was shit - your stock price was going up.

Snapchat, who has posted a profit only one quarter in its entire existence, hit a high of $80! It’s current price? $10.

They are just one example. Even before COVID, valuations were all about speculation around how big a company could *possibly* grow. COVID, and the free money it brought with it from the Fed, just amplified everything. And what is more speculative than crypto?

Cryptocurrency values shot through the mother fucking roof because of speculative investing - not a halving. Not a fear- greed index. Not a rainbow chart. Not anything else. There was free money, so big money movers said fuck it, let’s get some crypto cash. Hype and speculation + free money = fun times.

And there’s the problem. There is no more free money. There probably won’t be anything like that again any time soon. The Fed really fucked up a lot of stuff by printing so much, and we have already been seeing the effects in the stock market and crypto markets. Speculative investing is way down, and probably won’t come back in force any time soon.

Now, this isn’t to say Bitcoin, or any other cryptocurrency, is never going to moon again. Or that it will certainly never hit its peak again. All I’m saying is…be careful of just listening to the hype, echo chamber of this sub.

Everyone here wants the markets to go back up because we all have some degree of bags that we’re holding on to. Don’t FOMO, and don’t let yourself become someone else’s exit liquidity. The halving is not guaranteed to spike the price again. The fear-greed index is a half-baked attempt at understanding social sentiment. The rainbow chart just gets adjusted to fit every time it is proven wrong. Etc.

So be aware with whatever decisions you make. These coins may never hit their peak again. Or maybe it takes years to go back. Maybe it shoots up tomorrow because Buffet decides he wants to burn down the traditional markets. Who knows. Be smart - don’t listen to posts with nothing substantive in them - and don’t risk more than you can afford to lose.

That being said, 🚀🌕👯‍♀️🥂🍾"

The shit is getting more and more real!  It seems Kraken got the approval back in 2020 but nearing the launch soon!

This is extremely well timed, while Silvergate is struggling, a more legit, well funded and somewhat credible move in the ""Digital Asset Banking"" will bring the right thrust.

Not to forget, Kraken was screwed by SEC recently that impacted all of us, loosing the sweet DOT staking sucks, so good news is it's hopefully all scrutinized by Gary uncle and his team.

6/3/23,Current Market Sentiment Analysis- Where are we?,"The last few weeks have been full of FUD. Where should we start? 

- Regulation Uncertainty 
- Mt. GOX - Potential dump
- Silvergate Bank. 
- Ethereum Upgrade + Release of staked Ether. 
- War in Ukraine 
- Current state of economy. 

There are a lot of situations here that scream a potential dump is coming, but will we get a dump? 

I just wanted to provide my analysis which is focused heavily on sentiment but also technicals. 

Generally, when we reach a point of fear and maximum FUD in this Subreddit or on social media. We signal a bottom, or close to. I don’t think we are at maximum fear anymore but we are still fearful as a group based on the news being posted and the comments recieved. 

There is no argument that the biggest bottom signal was the FTX drop, and the following weeks after. That’s what we call maximum fear.

We are now in times if uncertainty. These recent pumps can wreck havoc on investor emotions. Do we sell the pump and get out for good, maybe we never hit a new all time high? 

Don’t fall for this psychological trap you set for yourself. 

The emotions are brutal and hard to manage. Luckily, these emotions you’re feeling, signal the end of a bear run and the beginning of a long accumulation phase.

The reasons I listed above for the FUD, are valid reasons to expect a dump and it’s very possible we get one, but the news is always blown way out of proportion and the reactions are usually swift. The good news is, these reaction dumps recover just as quick as they happen, often with a nice capitulation candle and volume signature that signals a new local bottom. If we do dump again, do not let the market shake you out and take your coins. The actual events are NEVER as bad as the news and social media makes them out to be.  

Remember: 

By the time everyone is calling for a recession, we are usually already recovering. This is a fact. There is a reason why 99% of people fail at managing their own investments. 

The stock market and Bitcoin are strongly correlated, as much as we would like this to stop. It likely won’t anytime soon.

The SP500 Is a reliable indicator to see where we are in the market and we just broke out of a 420 day down trend with a huge retest of the trend line. We held this line as support. We also have daily golden crosses across multiple big funds, all which signal a sustained uptrend. 

The DXY has completed a daily bearish cross and is also in a sustained down trend. This is historically very bullish for crypto. 

It is reasonable to feel bearish in this current environment, but you have to do the opposite of what you feel. No matter how you view the economic state or the current market, we have a lot of good social and technical indicators signalling the start of a new bull run coming soon. This will take a long time to play out of course, but the bull run has to start somewhere.

Ignore the news, ignore the FUD. HODL ON!"

6/3/23,Silvergate going down is a problem for crypto. It will limit new fiat entering the space and make it more difficult to create a company.,"It is clear that regulators are making it more difficult for fiat to reach exchanges. The silvergate case shows this, and I am not sure how we will solve it.

When it will become more difficult for new money to enter the ecosystem, crypto as a whole will eventually go down because the ecosystem costs money. Exchanges need to pay salaries and miners need to pay for electricity in fiat. We need a constant flow of new fiat in order to be sustainable. This, and creating a business in the crypto space will become much harder.

Eventually crypto will find a way, that is how crypto works, but it can set the whole industry back a few years. 

What are your thoughts about this?"

# Ray Dalio

Once upon a time, Dalio wasn't the biggest fan of crypto. He once raised concerns that it isn't a great medium of exchange, is  too volatile to act as a good store of wealth, and would likely be  outlawed by governments if it becomes too successful.

Despite his words. in 2021 Dalio admitted he owns Bitcoin and its ""greatest risk is its success"". He went on to say ""Bitcoin looks like a long-duration option on a highly unknown future  that I could put an amount of money in that I wouldn’t mind losing about 80% of."" In early 2022, Dalio said his hedge fund Bridgewater Associates plans to back a crypto fund.

# Kevin O' Leary

The greatest FTX shill himself. The man who informed to the masses of the greatness of FTX and SBF. The dude who even after FTX fell said he'd still invest with SBF in a future venture. This human being sang FTX praises, coming out of his mouth like water from your butt after a bad bowl of curry.  Kevin has also backed a crypto app called WonderFi that aims to make decentralized finance accessible to all.

You be shocked to know that in early 2021 he referred to Bitcoin as ""a nothing burger""."

6/3/23,Why we need crypto - Banks suck and we should move away from them,"I think many of us will agree that banks are terrible institutions and many of us believe that they should be replaced by decentralized finance. Of course banks provide a certain level of security but for many banks only up to 100k are actually insured. 

For me there are two main reason why banks suck so hard:

First off, many traditional banks charge you monthly fees for just holding your money there which is absolutely insane. They use our money for extremely unethical investments to generate more money for themselves. But they still have the audacity to charge fees…

Secondly, many banks in Europe charge negative interest on your money after a certain amount, sometimes around 50k. Absolutely crazy. Let me know if your bank does this. I would be interested to hear if this is also done on other continents.

On the other hand, with DeFi we can put our coins to use and are rewarded for that. With traditional banks we would be paying fees and losing money through negative interest rates. 

And this point has to be said that banks are learning and stopping the negative interest rates for customers. After 10 years, Denmark has quit this ridiculous experiment. Most banks will follow but still a great example on why banks suck and why we need crypto."

I was just browsing inside r/investing and there was a topic about if BTC is successful, why is it still fluctuating in price so much. Majority came to conclusion that BTC failed at being a currency and that if it is supposed to be a store of value... Well ""anything can be a store of value from baseball cards to Pokémon"".

Well I tried to argue over there and just give them idea why we are still early in adoption.


There are currently 2.668 billionaires in the world.

$12.700.000.000.000.000.000 ~ $12.7T and from last year (according to Google, there is +236 of them)

What about millionaires you might think?

There are 62,5M = 62.500.000 millionaires with net worth of $158.261.000.000.000.000.000 ~ $158.261T

- The crypto market is a casino

- Crypto is a greater fool scam

- Crypto is zero sum game 

- Crypto has no use case or utility outside speculation 

- Crypto (especially Bitcoin) isn't money and it isn't a currency. 

- Crypto is a volatile and speculative asset

- Crypto isn't an investment: it's gambling 

- The unregulated crypto markets lack any form of investor protection and are susceptible to all types of manipulations, scams and frauds

And so on

Instead of asking themselves ""why are these things being said - let me investigate and look deeper into these arguments"". People will instead dismiss the critics with the dumbest 1-line copes.

- ""they're just mad because they sold at a loss""

- ""they're just fudding to buy cheap on the low""

- ""they're being paid by tradfi ""

- ""if you don't like it don't buy it, i don't go around shitting on things I don't like, if you don't like it ignore it""

- ""'I made X amount of profit since Y Date. Don't listen to these fudsters if you want to get rich like me""

- ""they just don't get it""

Let me translate this line ""just don't get"". It really means ""I don't have an objective and rational explanation for my beliefs"". 

Crypto really doesn't even have good defenses against any criticism except for some vague promise of ""we'll wait and see in the future - crypto is like the early internet"". 

When Dan Olson's documentary ""Line goes up- The problem with Nfts"" came out, I was waiting for the response from the crypto community. They really couldn't come up with shit except for ""he is really angry and he's short sighted and doesn't understand the future potential""

Step out of your echo chambers and bubbles and ask yourself - why does almost every other sub shit on crypto everytime it's brought up. Will you lie to yourself and say it's because ""they're just jealous"" or ""they just don't get it"".

Honestly ask yourselves why people shit on crypto, and stop trying to dismiss critics with childish 1 liners."

CZ is a shady person, with pause of USDC withdraws, not releasing proof of reserves for awhile and now with money laundering.

Binance isn't a trustworthy exchange, all that they are is some giant exchange with a shady CEO. It's all about self custody, how can you trust some giant exchange with all your funds when you constantly hear bad things about them? Satoshi wouldn't of wanted things to be this way, he was about self custody and control and power over your own finances. 

Kraken is a trust worthy exchange, but, it's founder even said you should keep your money off exchanges.(Still you should never trust exchanges) 

If Binance falls it might do a damper to the OG coins, but hey, at least they'll be cheap. Turn that negative into a positive and keep accumulating, we're still early.

As you can clearly see from this 100% real and authentic tweet (notice the checkmark), Vitalik made the announcement earlier this morning. He even went so far to thank some reddit users for speaking with him about moons.

So the first one is not that special, its a vpn provider named AirVpn, i cant say very much about it as i am just using it for a couple of days, but so far so good, connections are fast and reliable, nothing to complain.

now the reason why i even started to post this is the second shop i found because it actually blew my mind. i was looking for a boardgame which kickstarter i missed and  couldn\`t find the game anywhere. I was ready to give up and thats when i found a Lithuanian store  [https://www.manohobis.com](https://www.manohobis.com/) that not only had it in Stock, you could pay with bitcoin aswell... and now the cherry on top: it even had Lighning integration!! \*Mind\* \*-blown-\*

paid via phoenix wallet, bam, done in seconds no fees! didt have to reagister they only needed my adress for shipping! oh and they are using BtcPay server btw...

ps: i instantly bought the money that i spent back via peach (p2p nkyc)

the future is bright fellow bitcoiners

DO any of you know other shops that have lightning integrated Bicoin payments as an option (except bitrefill)?

6/3/23,"At Northern Lightning 2023, Norway may offer the wildest Bitcoin experience yet","**Norway is putting on a major Bitcoin conference with high-signal speakers, topped off with an otherworldly rave running on Lightning.**

[Published in Bitcoin Magazine](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/wild-at-northern-lightning-conference).

[Northern Lightning may be the wildest Bitcoin experience yet](https://preview.redd.it/k4mu3g56g5ma1.png?width=1414&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=30b8b0cac50a4be26a6ec100f455939add1ee8ba)

Scandinavia may not be the first region that comes to mind when you think of Bitcoin, but tiny Norway has become the “[biggest bitcoin mining hub in Europe](https://hashrateindex.com/blog/bitcoin-mining-around-the-world-norway/).”

With [less than 0.07% of world population](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/norway-population/#:~:text=Norway%20population%20is%20equivalent%20to%200.07%25%20of%20the%20total%20world%20population.), the Norwegians churn out [nearly 3% of Bitcoin’s global hash rate](https://hashrateindex.com/blog/bitcoin-mining-around-the-world-norway/), mostly thanks to cheap, stranded and renewable hydropower in the north.

And now, Norway is hosting the world’s “most Bitcoin experience” (sic): [Northern Lightning 2023](https://bitcoincoffee.shop/billettsentral/etn/tickets/).

## A Pure-Signal Conference

Northern Lightning 2023 [will take place in Bergen, Norway from March 17 to 19,](https://bitcoincoffee.shop/billettsentral/etn/tickets/) from the 17th to the 19th of March, and the Norwegians are going all out, it seems.

Everything has been designed for and by Bitcoiners, from the keynotes, to the food, to the parties, to the merch. Merch will be limited to 21 numbered copies, of course. Our vision is to create an annual, intimate experience bringing Bitcoin to a new Nordic city each year, until hyperbitcoinization is achieved and beyond.

&#x200B;

[Northern Lightning includes some of the great minds in Bitcoin.](https://preview.redd.it/p1vcgwfcg5ma1.png?width=1414&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a3071a1ea62dadb8ecc9491dd7533dfd54e14042)

This first edition will be a three-day Bitcoin conference in a historical setting among the dramatic scenery and wooden harbors of Bergen, headlined by the greatest minds in Bitcoin, with the opportunity to orange pill hundreds of no-coiners at a massive party running on the Lightning Network.

Hodlonaut, Knut Svanholm and Peter Todd are just [some of the great Bitcoiners who will be joining](https://twitter.com/EuroDale/status/1631587272595324928), covering topics like monetary liberation, Bitcoin adoption and Lightning innovation.

Focused on bringing Bitcoiners together and creating deep connections with minimal stage staring, Northern Lightning also wants to provide the purest signal anywhere. Even the DJs are Bitcoiners.

## A Rave Running On Lightning?

Even the DJs? Yes.

The highlight of Northern Lightning will be one of the largest, AFK Bitcoin onboarding events in the world: [an all-night rave with hundreds of no-coiners set to all use Lightning](https://bitcoincoffee.shop/billettsentral/etn/party/).

Headlined by Norway’s leading electronic artists, including Karolinski, Matiago, Klysterik, Antibakke and Trym Søvdsnes, it is set to be a unique orange-pilling opportunity.

A lineup this good would fill any venue. So, what happens when 400 thirsty no-coiners meet 200 Bitcoiners and they all need to use Lightning to buy a beer?

[Some of Norway's best electronic artists are playing at Northern Lightning.](https://preview.redd.it/06icuwdfg5ma1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c2be5c71e02437b2a1921f63b32663b643db79a4)

With the goal of creating an unforgettable, real-world experience of Bitcoin for everyone, every year, a rave running on Lightning is a perfect start. Party goers will have the opportunity to use Lightning when buying drinks, renting towels or buying merch, and even buying bitcoin for cash peer-to-peer when onboarding.

It’s all designed to offer a little less conversation, a little more Bitcoin action.

And as for the venue, [Smien Laksevåg Verft](https://www.facebook.com/smienlaxevaag/) is Bergen’s oldest ship wharf, recently converted into a nightclub opening directly onto the fjord, which will offer free welcome drinks as well as sauna use and an all-night barbecue.

## Not Only For Adults

Talk of raves may not appeal to the more family oriented, but Northern Lightning 2023 has got you and your little ones covered, too.

My own daughter, [Lykushka (who is nine)](https://twitter.com/EuroDale/status/1629173626967580674) is organizing the kids’ corner and workshop, a space to educate young minds about Bitcoin while having lots of fun. I love when my kids make friends with other Bitcoiners’ kids, they’re usually brilliant too.

Whether the event will make them think mommy and daddy are more or less nuts remains to be seen, but they will be welcomed every day until 10 p.m. at Northern Lightning.

## Almost Sold Out

Northern Lightning is less than two weeks away and passes are selling out fast.

The main conference pass, including access to keynotes, workshops, dinners, meetups and parties, will sell out this weekend. After that, only limited passes will be available, but the limited passes are pretty awesome and you’re not gonna want to miss out.

6/3/23,Organized Bank Run Idea - Comments Welcome,"Anyone up for starting an organized grassroots bank run to expose the banks for the frauds they are? One way to push the Bitcoin value proposition forward would be to organize a grassroots bank run across the United States and show that the US dollar is the ultimate shitcoin ponzi. 

Essentially we would try to organize a single day where a large swath of people go to the bank and pull out a certain amount of cash. Either that or make it where its a two month long endeavor and everyone withdrawals smaller amounts so that the banks aren't spooked. 

The end goal would be to force the banks to halt the ability for people to withdraw cash for a time and that way normies would finally see that the emperor has no clothes, that the reserves inside a bank are a small fraction of the actual liabilities they owe to customers. 

I would love to mirror the grassroots effort of [dontpay.uk](https://dontpay.uk) with this effort.

I understand that there is risk that this pulls forward the demise of trust in the current banking system (hurting everyday people in the short run) but I think exposing the fraud that is fractional reserve banking to the everyday person is critical and will help fast track Bitcoin adoption as people race to educate themselves on the best bearer monetary asset every created. Its necessary for people to understand the system they currently operate in but don't understand. 

Roadmap would be to set up a landing page with info about the bank run once details are solidified. We would want to move the communication about the project to a more secure and private messaging platform. But simply put, circle a date to have a run on the banks and then spread the word quietly through secure channels to as many bitcoiners as possible. 

Thoughts?"

6/3/23,How Wallet Mobile Softwares deal with Wallet Balance and Transactions history?,"Hi everyone! Hope ur doing well. I'm trying to develop a mobile software Bitcoin Wallet made in **Flutter** with a **Bitcoin Core Full node** that communicates with a **Node.js** backend.

The problem I can't find the answer to is: **how can wallet softwares keep up all the incoming transactions from potentially thousands of addresses?**

I wouldn't really like to rely on any third party APIs like blockchain.com but in the other hand Bitcoin Core and bitcoin-cli don't allow me to check transactions starting from an addresses other than the ones from manually imported wallets (*which would be clearly impractical from a software that is expected to work fast, with multiple HD wallets and mostly of all, where I don't have to store the private key other than the user device.*).

So, how do wallets work in this regard? Do they rely on a third party and if so, how are those parties able to work as well as (for example) blockchain.com? **What am I missing**?

If the solution is to import into BC all the wallets created via Dart, is there a way to manage thousands of users in one or more Bitcoin Core nodes ensuring 100% **security** and **speed**?

Thanks a lot!

EDIT: I want to clarify that obviously the device won’t run a full node by itself but I have servers that deal with the backend and node."

6/3/23,"Orange pilled, how am I doing?","Hi everyone.

(Throwaway just in case)

I've been ""into"" cryptocurrencies for a few years now, since roughly 2016. Before the first bull run anyway. 

For the past few weeks I've been studying Bitcoin and made some startling realizations.

1. Holy shit I don't own any bitcoin. I sure hope Binance will accept my IOU. What if they go bankrupt. Holy shit.
2. I cannot believe anyone accepts this nothing-backed paper money called fiat currency.
3. How did I not realize what bitcoin was all those years ago, why was I only fixated on price.
4. Bitcoin, not crypto

I remember this shift in perspective after about a week of reading about bitcoin. Looking around me, the world had changed. It is as if I'm seeing something that the others cannot, even though it's right before their eyes. I now understand this as being orange pilled. After that I haven't been able to stop learning about bitcoin. 

Bitcoin is sound money, can never exceed 21 million, outside of government control, no inflation, no trust. It's an incredible invention/discovery. 

I tell people about bitcoin, yet no one cares. 

""You can own your own money""

""It's like buying 1/21.000.000th of the worlds gold""

The response is a polite ""that's interesting"" at best. Mostly people only care about the price (like I did myself), and cannot look past it as an investment in the traditional sense. They don't see the issue with the money today.

This is somewhat comforting in that I'm still early, even being all these years late. But still lonely. 

I feel like the dog that is chained to a stick. It feels completely free right up until it reaches the end of it's allowed space, then the chain tightens. The government is allowing cash to disappear, restricting how much cash you can withdraw, inflating our currency, requiring KYC on the exchanges. and if you want to do something else, if you don't agree, the chain tightens. You play by the rules of the game.

So now I just got my Trezor in the mail. Moved over a small amount of BTC before factory resetting and recovering and only then moving over the rest of ""my"" BTC. Which Binance was so kind to let me do.

I am now the proud owner of my own bitcoin for the first time. Let me just say what a relief it was seeing the transactions on my wallet with 10 confirmations after waiting for days knowing full well that ""not your keys not your bitcoin"". 

From here I want to run my own node and set up a lightning wallet in order to pay for things using bitcoin and tip users here on the forum. Also planning for my metal seed backup. Along with how to transition from KYC to non-KYC bitcoin. As a vanity metric I want to reach that 100.000.000 satoshi. Also need a new exchange...

So tell me how automated trading works and how I can connect these exchanges with TradingView.


Further than that, can automated bot trading be reliable, and can it execute (enter and exit) my trade properly?


And finally, how this actually worked I mean, can it execute my trade to take a buy and sell signal from Tradingview Indicators? So if you guys know anything about it, kindly explain it to me if you guys have time on your hands.


I really look forward to it because there is very little information about it on the internet.

6/3/23,Redlight Finance: How a Gas-Less System Could Revolutionize Blockchain Transactions,"Have you ever been frustrated by the cost of executing transactions on a blockchain? If so, you're not alone. Transaction fees can be a significant obstacle for users, particularly for businesses and industries that require large databases of private information.


But what exactly is a gas-less system, and how does it work? In traditional blockchains, users are required to pay a fee (called gas) to execute transactions on the network. This fee is paid in the network's native token and is used to compensate miners for the work required to process the transaction.

However, the gas-less system offered by Redlight Finance eliminates the need for transaction fees altogether. Instead of paying a fee, users can interact with the platform without worrying about the cost of executing transactions. This is particularly beneficial for businesses and industries that require large databases of private information, such as hospitals and financial institutions.

But how does Redlight Finance's gas-less system work? The system uses a unique consensus mechanism called Proof of Redlight. This mechanism is designed to be more energy-efficient and cost-effective than traditional Proof of Work and Proof of Stake mechanisms.

In Proof of Redlight, users can stake the platform's native token, REDLC, to participate in the consensus mechanism. By staking the token, users can earn rewards, and the token will be live on Mexc which will help to secure the network, while also contributing to the decentralization of the platform."

I'm a music producer/graphic designer and make my living through selling instrumentals/beats/designs to artists via my online store. Unfortunately, because of the store's limitations, the only way I can accept funds is through PayPal.

This was never an issue before because if I get a sale today, I withdraw the PayPal USD through a local bank in my country (South Africa) and I have access to my local fiat currency within 3 days. Well, my local bank who is the only bank to partner with PayPal here had massive system failures over the past 2 weeks which caused my fund to be 'held hostage' and they wouldn't take any accountability. It was terrible, I couldn't pay my bills or buy food but I eventually got my money 2 days ago.  


I posted about this frustration here on Reddit and a very generous, kind human tipped like $10 in protest of PayPal through a bot called u/chaintip which makes use of BCH. Another kind human tipped me $2 as well. I was super skeptical about it but when I sent my receiving address, I had the funds in seconds.  


I then sent it to a local wallet with little to no fees and I literally have access to use the funds locally in my country within HOURS. As you can imagine this is mind blowing to me because I don't know much about crypto but once someone paid me in bitcoin - took forever, and the fees were gross, so I never tried again.   


All of this got me thinking and wondering if there are any job boards/websites or subreddits I can look at in future to find freelance graphic design and/or music work.   


Graphic design work = branding, logos, website design  


Music work = making beats, instrumentals, jingles, ghost writing, etc."
6/3/23,Bitcoin Cash Weekly News By Satoshi's Angels For March 6 2003,
6/3/23,1st BitcoinCash Meetup In Lebanon,"The adoption of BitcoinCash has been gaining traction around the world, and Lebanon is no exception.

On the 8th of March, 2023, the first BitcoinCash meetup will be held  in Lebanon to promote the use and adoption of BitcoinCash in the  country. This article will provide an in-depth look at the event,  including the activities that will be carried out during the meetup. The  adoption of BitcoinCash in Lebanon is still in its early stages, but  there is growing interest in the cryptocurrency among the Lebanese  population. Lebanon is a country that has been plagued by economic and  political instability, and the use of BitcoinCash could potentially  offer a solution to some of these issues. One of the key advantages of  BitcoinCash is its low transaction fees, which make it an attractive  option for individuals and businesses looking to save money on payment  processing. This is particularly important in a country like Lebanon,  where high fees and strict currency controls have made it difficult to  conduct financial transactions.

Another advantage of BitcoinCash is its fast transaction times, which  allow for near-instant payments. This can be particularly useful for  businesses that need to move money quickly, as well as individuals who  need to make payments in a timely manner. BitcoinCash is also  decentralized, meaning that it is not controlled by any single entity or  government. This provides users with greater financial freedom and  security, as their funds are not subject to the whims of central  authorities. Despite these advantages, there are still some challenges  to the adoption of BitcoinCash in Lebanon. One of the main obstacles is a  lack of awareness and education about the cryptocurrency. Many Lebanese  are unfamiliar with BitcoinCash and how it works, which makes it  difficult to gain widespread adoption. There are also regulatory hurdles  to overcome, as the Lebanese government has not yet established clear  guidelines for the use of cryptocurrencies. This has led to some  uncertainty among potential users and businesses, as they are unsure  about the legal implications of using BitcoinCash. Despite these  challenges, there are signs that the adoption of BitcoinCash in Lebanon  is gaining momentum. 

The first BitcoinCash meetup in Lebanon, which is scheduled to take  place on the 8th of March 2023, is an important step in this process.  The meetup will provide attendees with a deeper understanding of  BitcoinCash and its benefits, and could help to spark greater interest  in the cryptocurrency among the Lebanese population.

# Understanding BitcoinCash

To kick off the event, a brief overview of BitcoinCash will be provided.  This will include a detailed explanation of what BitcoinCash is, how it  works, and its advantages over traditional payment methods. This  section will also cover the history of BitcoinCash, how it differs from  Bitcoin, and why it is important for the Lebanese community to start  using it.

# The Importance of Spreading Adoption

The importance of spreading the adoption of BitcoinCash in Lebanon will  be discussed in this chapter. This section will focus on the benefits of  using BitcoinCash, including its low transaction fees, fast transaction  times, and decentralized nature. The chapter will also cover the impact  that the adoption of BitcoinCash could have on the Lebanese economy,  including increased financial inclusion and economic growth.

# Meetup Activities

The main section of the article will focus on the activities that  will take place during the meetup. These activities are designed to  engage attendees and promote the use of BitcoinCash in Lebanon.

3.1 Distribution of Stickers, T-Shirts, Hats, Pins, and Mini Flags

Attendees will receive free BitcoinCash merchandise, including  stickers, t-shirts, hats, pins, and mini flags. This merchandise is  designed to promote the use of BitcoinCash and create a sense of  community among attendees.

3.2 Q&A Sessions

There will be several Q&A sessions during the event, where  attendees can ask questions about BitcoinCash and its use in Lebanon.  These sessions will be led by experts in the field who will provide  detailed and informative answers.

3.3 Presentation on Projection Screen

A presentation on BitcoinCash will be displayed on a projection  screen, providing attendees with a visual representation of how  BitcoinCash works and its benefits. This presentation will be  interactive and engaging, providing attendees with a deeper  understanding of the topic.

The first BitcoinCash meetup in Lebanon is an important event that will  help to spread the adoption of BitcoinCash in the country. By providing  attendees with a deeper understanding of BitcoinCash and its benefits,  we hope to encourage more people to start using this revolutionary  payment method. The activities planned for the event are designed to be  engaging, interactive, and informative, making it an event not to be  missed."

Do I need to wait 21 days for my funds to be unstaked?"
6/3/23,The Most Essential Information CoinBase Is Lacking Of,"I am really considering on transferring all my assets to another crypto exchange.

Why?

Because **CoinBase lacks in showing your own Profit / Loss statistic in a straigthforward / simple manner**. I am not talking about the Total Balance of your CoinBase account (that is shown and well).

**What we do not have is a single page where you would see the complete list of your assets together with the percentage (%) and the absolute value of the Profit (in positive green) or Loss (in negative red) of your investment.** The Profit / Loss, not of last 24 hours, not of last 7 days, not of last month, but since your asset investment dates to see if you are making money or losing money with a particular asset.

**The only way I can see Profit / Loss of an asset is through the CoinBase Mobile app** (yes, only the mobile version, not the website one — I just do not undertand this ""discrimination""). **These are the steps** you must take to **ONLY** see one particular asset's profit/loss information (in %, not absolute value):

* *CoinBase App -> My Assets -> Bitcoin -> Bitcoin Main Balance -> Select any buy transaction -> Click on ""upload"" icon (top right corner)*

Now, imagine doing this **for each cryptocurrency** you own, **for each transaction** you have made.**Is not this a waste of time?**

**Why can not CoinBase provide a single page where it shows you the Profit / Loss of each asset you own?** What is the point of seeing the Total Balance of your account, if then you can not know immediately which asset is making or losing you money?

**P.S.:**

1. \- If I missed a menu where CoinBase shows you the Profit / Loss, please, do prove me wrong.
2. \- Yes, you can make a simple (or not so simple) Google Sheets where, e.g., you request through API Connector extension your account assets information and the cryptocurrency spot prices from CoinBase, and then apply all the formulas you need. I am doing that and I know how to code. But, what about those who do not know how to code? Is it fair to keep them in the dark? Is software meant to easy our lives out, or not?"
6/3/23,Has anyone received Coinbase card rewards since the maintentance?,"Coinbase card rewards used to post almost immediately once the transaction shows as completed.

I called two days ago, was told if the line got disconnected the agent would call me back on the number I provided, I explained how pissed off I was and why, was put on hold while he ""investigated,"" and then got hung up on. I've filed a complaint about the case, and frankly, how shitty your support is.

My father left me very little when he passed, and some of that very little is tied up on your absolute garbage platform. This is nothing short of shameful."
6/3/23,Unable to sell USDT on Coinbase,"Hi, just got some USDT to my Coinbase account and wanted to cash them out for fiat. Unfortunately, there is no sell option for USDT. Is the only option here to first trade my USDT for a ""sellable"" asset like ETH and then cash it out? Why does Coinbase not offer the cash-out option for USDT?"

6/3/23,sending a new purchase off of coinbase,"hey everyone. i am using crypto for the first time in a while and my god have things changed. i first came into the scene in 2016 and this is just… not it. regulation hell. 

im in a time sensitive situation and of course coinbase doesnt let you send the funds off of coinbase for several days. is there any way around this? for example, can i send to another wallet that is also on coinbase, and then have that person send it off of coinbase? or am i just screwed?"

6/3/23,Why I stopped using PayPal for other payment methods," Guys, this is an open discussion; this is my experience with PayPal, and it's possible that's why I came to the conclusion that crypto payment is far superior.   

On PayPal, I pay around 4% on every transaction, which is a lot considering I have to pay tax and other fees, plus I have to do monthly cross-border transactions, which is an additional fee. Another major issue is PayPal customer service, which is terrible and takes forever to respond to. I used to put up with all of this until I tried paying with cryptocurrency, which was much cheaper, and faster, and I wasn't even charged for cross-border transactions.

   I think this is the reason why many are gradually accepting crypto as payment, and I see this as the future! In less than a decade, crypto payment platforms will dominate over traditional payment systems, and the likes of PayPal will be irrelevant. I’m sure they know this too; that’s why they started offering crypto payment, for which you will still need to pay their hilarious fees.  

Are you still using PayPal? If not, why did you stop using it? And which payment method did you switch to?"
