12/3/23,"Exactly 3 years ago, on March 12th 2020, bitcoin price crashed 50% in one day.","... In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had just begun to spread globally. This caused a widespread panic and uncertainty in financial markets which lead to sharp declines in global markets... bitcoin was no exception to this.

In just one day, exactly 3 years ago.. bitcoin price took a horrendous nosedive.. dropping 50% (FIFTY PERCENT) in just one day.

This caused huge liquidation cascade on once popular exchange BitMEX. $750 million in bitcoin was liquidated in a matter of minutes. This created a swift drop to the $3600 low... the exchange was then very conveniently closed for ""maintenance"" :D ^((Its owner Arthur Hayes was sentenced to 2 years of probation for money laundering))

Another popular exchange at that time - Deribit also faced technical difficulties

In two months however bitcoin price completely recovered and proceeded to make new all time high some time later...

* Were you panicking?
* Or were you buying like a real chad?

12/3/23,This time I not making the same mistake again and missing out on the bear market: My biggest regret was not buying in early 2020,"In early 2020 BTC hit an insane low around 3k and I was suddenly interested. I had some money to spare and life was pretty boring during that time. The only problem: The KYC on Kraken. Many of you will remember that in the past you had to take a picture of yourself while holding up a piece of paper with a message on it. The message usually included the date and your name. After many attempts I finally gave up and did not try any further. Of course this is my biggest crypto regret but I have learned from it. 

Now I feel lucky that I have the opportunity to invest during a bear market. Obviously the prices are not at the 2020 level. Still I feel great that I am taking the opportunity to buy during the bear market and I feel confident that this is the right decision. This time I am not missing out and I will not be repeating the mistakes of the past. 

Funny story: In late 2020 I received an email from Kraken that they changed their verification process and I was now accepted and free to trade. By then BTC had already gone up strongly and felt like Kraken was trolling me."

12/3/23,Safemoon appears to be getting rugged,"Yes, we know it has already been rugged with their CEO stealing from the LP, but it is now accelerating today. 

Down over 29% on 24hr, 15% in last 1hr, reaching a new ATL. This is after the CEO John Karony went to court suing his own mother. The MC is now just $100mil and down 95% from ATH.

[It has also now topped the loser list out of the top 1000 coins by market cap](https://www.coingecko.com/en/crypto-gainers-losers) for coin that has lost the most in the last 24 hours. 

Doesn't seem like there are any lifeboats left to get off that sinking boat ...

Remember those windmills, ""The Gambia"", a project called ""Pheonix"" after their leader mistyped ""phoenix"", the liquidity pool being drained by their CEO? Coffeezilla? That weird guy called Papa that they all worshiped? Etc? 

Quote below from one of the posters on r/safemoon about this court case (it's a great read some of the posts there with how delusional those ""investors"" are by the way - definitely recommend visiting their subreddit). 

>This is the lawsuit where John (Ronin Energy Group and Ronin Real Estate) invested $5M (from SFM liquidity) into his mom's Emanations Communications Group (ECG) that was supposed to install communication antenna in The Gambia. BTW, Karony's initial $1.5M investment to ECG happened in June 2021....or right after raising $1M for the ""exchange"".
Then his mom formed ECG Energy and ECG IP. John had zero ownership/control of assets nor operations. He didn't like that.
John (Ronin Real Estate ) also gave his mom $127k for a down payment on a house in North Salt Lake City on Gary Way..
He also claims to have provided $150k (through Ronin Energy) to ECG to research wind turbines.
His mom went on a spending spree with the money and ECG went broke..

>Then she got a loan from Lex Vest (Knecht & Castor).. She did not live up to those loan agreements, so Lex Vest gains control of the company and assets. BTW, Lex Vest was formed 10 days before she got that loan.

>So, in a nutshell, John Karony stole from the SafeMoon liquidity and exchange donations to fund his mom's business, she used the money on herself instead, ECG supposedly went broke, and then some random newly formed company takes control of it all."
12/3/23,You could avoid 99.99% of all problems in crypto if you would hold just two top coins in your wallet and do nothing else.,"Every times some bad things happen my first reaction is simple - why is everyone so worried? If you would just buy BTC and ETH and hold them in wallet ( not exchange!) without doing anything else no bad news would ever hurt you. Some USDC, Silvergate, Luna or FTX shit? All worries could be avoided if you would just hold BTC and ETH. 


If you can't  play with fire  don't do it. We always talk about our portfolios being down, but truth is it is always our fault, we are greedy so instead BTC and ETH we try to get something riskier and better  to outplay the system and usually fail miserably. I do not say only buy BTC and ETH, it would be too boring, but at least play with max 10% or 20% of your portfolio. If you will have 80% in BTC and ETH even if you lose all those 20%  in long term you should be in profit anyway. Problem is majority of us don't respect rules and gamble  with everything. But then we must also accept responsibility for our actions. Most people can't do that they will blame economy, banks, exchanges, other coins or everyone else for their portfolio being red. All could be avoided if they would just buy BTC and ETH. In long term those two coins are only ones that can be treated as safe, unlike most other coins that may fail at any given time."
12/3/23,TVL for Moons Hits 400K,"From the dreadful news of USDC and the current tank of the market. TVL for Moons hits 400K, this is some exciting news this sub has had all weekend.

Moons are currently at .23 cents with a total market cap of 26 million. It’s only up from here with Moons and I think everyone can agree that moons is the only green that’s currently in our portfolio.

It’s exciting what the future holds for moons, with hopes of moons being able to be used to purchase Reddit avatars in the upcoming marketplace. I wonder when the hype of moons will hit the media and spread the fact that people can earn money by participating in a subreddit? Guess only time will tell on that one, but hey let's hope that will happen sometime in this upcoming Summer.

Cheers to 400K TVL, now let’s get 500K!

12/3/23,The calm before the storm…,"This feels way too chill for all that is happening and may go down. Monday will resume locked trading of USDC and who knows how many other ripples will be caused by the SVB collapse. Reserves of all kinds at unknown amounts that may not ever be recouped.

I follow Krowns crypto trading and he is about as unbiased as they come and very good at analysis. He has a tweet claiming extreme news events that happen usually the price action to reflect takes 2-4 weeks to play out. In this case it’s negative news so time will tell.

Anyways, I have sold a decent amount and do think once the storm comes after there will be much better prices so that’s my optimistic outlook. 

For anyone who wants to say I’m being dramatic or just FUDing. I guess we will see. I think in a month the full effects of SVB will be about over. Will other dominoes fall? Should be a wild ride and in it together."

12/3/23,Early retirement from crypto.,"We all have the dream of early retirement. The day when you finally hit your price target and it’s all smooth sailing from here. 

What if you open your wallet one day and see your coins are worth 1 million + what will you do? 

To many of us this is a far away dream. We think about it often, but never truly believe it will come to fruition. 

If one day you wake up and see that magical number, What are your plans? 

Have you thought that far ahead, would you leave a portion in crypto or leave this crazy world for good, maybe walk into your bosses office and say all those things you’ve always wanted to? 

For those of you who have reached this goal:

Is it as good as you thought it would be, what advice could you give to us to avoid some of the mistakes that you’ve made?

I think everyone should have a plan in place in case this happens, I also think it’s good to learn from others mistakes and gain some perspective.

12/3/23,"Bitcoin miners havent sold this many Bitcoin since the China ban in 2021, as miners are sending more Bitcoin to exchanges than around the Luna/3AC collapse and the fall of FTX","Bitcoin miners are absolutely pivotal to Bitcoin's price. Generally, when they hold their Bitcoin, the price stays relatively stable or is free to move up. But during periods when miners sell a lot of their holdings, we often see a drop in price.

New data shows that Bitcoin miners have not sold this many Bitcoin since the China ban in 2021. Back then, Bitcoin was hovering around $55,000 per coin and China's State Council announced a formal ban on crypto mining. Shortly after, the hash rate on Bitcoin's network dropped 50%, with BTC’s price plunging to about $30,000 in the ensuing months.

The selling we see from miners right now is actually greater than during the Luna/3AC/Celsius collapse AND than during the FTX collapse.

12/3/23,"It's ironic how critics and mainstream media called crypto a house of cards. Now everyone is seeing that traditional finance/banking is not the stable perfect system they made it out to be, and why it does need change, since 2008 wasn't enough proof","Firstly, it's obvious that none of this is good. A lot of people will lose a lot of money, and it is usually the little guy who does either directly or indirectly. But is certainly is ironic that everyone is once again(like 2008) caught with their pants down with traditional finance(TradFi) and the banking system. Experts expected other banks to fall from this, even if it's only non-mainstream small/micro-banks, but all of them will feel a pinch, meaning the whole economy will surely feel it as after-effects. We know  the giant Credit Suisse is already in a pretty bad state, so it won't be at all surprising if they fall. And if *they* do, well all hands on deck. And imagine Fed chair Powell is(was?) set on hiking rates. That sounds like a sure-fire way to crash the economy.

People like to act like crypto was created out of nothing as a scam, when in actuality. Many don't know that crypto(really Bitcoin) was created in 2009/2009 directly directly *as a response* to the 2008 crash. People act like there isn't problems in the banking system that seriously need addressing, some of them being problems that crypto solves, although crypto does have some problems of its own. But these problems are mostly tied to it simply being very early and can be mostly remedied with time as it matures like more secure smart contract code and low adoption leading to volatility and difficulty of use. But many problems in the already mature TradFi banking system are fundamental and there by design. TradFi is a system where the rich are rewarded for being rich, and the richer they are the more they are rewarded. It's also a system that, as pointed out even in the White House ""*Crypto Report""* last year, is terrible for sending cross-border payments, like many low-income overseas workers do for remittance for family back home, and millions working in essential but non-traditional are left out of the system among other things. Even non-rich traditional workers are afforded much worse services/rates compared to the rich. We never said crypto was perfect, but they acted like the banking system and TradFi was, especially when referencing cryptocurrency. And this is where we are now, apparently back to 2008. All because some people tried to improve the financial system and move past it, while many others clung on to what was (probably) always a a sinking ship."
12/3/23,"At this point, I'm in crypto for the entertainment rather than profits","Don't get me wrong. I really think that a mature crypto eco-system could greatly benefit the world.  But where we are now is fairly far from mature, with a lot of issues to work out. Crypto is volatile even on a good day and profits are never assured. Much less for when crypto firms and projects are going up-down and sideways. But I have to say that if it's one sure thing in crypto, even more so than losses, is entertainment.

Every day now there something wild going on. Even on a ""calm"" day, if you look hard enough you're sure to find something crazy going on. Someone made millions, someone lost millions, another firm crash, some project rugpulled, SafeMoon makes another empty promise to rave reception, etc. Sometimes it something so obvious like falling for 23940958487% APY or getting 5 ETH for only 1 ETH. Or a scheme so sophisticated you are impressed and you think maybe they deserved the money for the fraudulent but complex well-planned and orchestrated scheme. It's always something exception with big money involved for maximum entertainment value.

Don't  get me know I'm here for the tech. The tech is good sure, but the entertainment is even better."
12/3/23,How likely is it I will be able to cash out my USDC from Coinbase tomorrow ?,"I am absolutely beside myself with worry. I have about $20k in USDC on my Coinbase and there is a family emergency in progress and long story short, I REALLY need that money. I feel physically sick thinking about what might happen next.

I wasn't paying attention to the news at all and just noticed what was up an hour ago when I tried to sell my USDC to cash out. 

Is this going to be another Luna episode or am I over reacting? This literally could not have come at a worse time as far as I'm concerned. 

Also, what time do the markets open tomorrow? I want to just jump in and take this out straight away.

Thank you for any advice.

Update: A big thank you to r/irockalltherocks for telling me to use the Advanced Trade functionality to sell my USDC. I was able to convert to Euros and have learned an extremely valuable lesson here today. Honestly I'm still shaking, thank you everyone for all your advice."

So what's the most cringe-worthy thing you've done or said in terms of cryptos? Was it a silly mistake that cost you a lot of money? Did you accidentally shill a scam coin? Or did you get caught up in FOMO and make a bad investment?

Who knows, maybe we can all learn from each other's experiences and become better investors and hodlers :)"
12/3/23,We’ve just completed a near-full crypto space cleanup,"This last year we’ve had lots of negative factors and events in crypto joint by quite bad economic situation in the world that lead to some really big challenges to all of the crypto industry. 

First we got a LUNA collapse which impacted the entire crypto market and tanked the price of all of the coins. This lead to the shakeup of the lending exchanges and made some companies like Celsius or Voyager to go out of business completely. 3AC was forced into liquidation too. Public learnt that no coin is safe and you have to be extremely cautious of those altcoins.

Then we had the whole FTX fiasco. This hit was bad on crypto and people, but it was especially bad for all of the exchanges. Crypto com got a huge stress test with all the massive fud spreading around themwhich they passed, binance and other exchanges were experiencing massive withdrawals and this lead to people understanding the importance of self-custody. 

Now we have the bank of some crypto companies and even stablecoins to receive a hit. All the stablecoins are on shaky ground which surprisingly made USDT the most safe of them all at this particular moment. These coming few days or even weeks will show us who is gonna fail this teat and who will succeed. 

I know that there’re still lots of uncertainty and doubts about all of the coins individually and crypto industry as a whole, but during this last year we’ve had a good chance to see who is most likely gonna stay here for the long time."
12/3/23,"Accidentally approved a phising contract, lost all my money - Can I do anything at all?","With the depeg of USDC i decided I wanted to move my Crypto around. I only use two lending protocols, Venus.io and Annex.finance. 

I had $2k BUSD on Annex, and was borrowing 2,5 BNB. 
On Annex I supplied $3k worth of their stablecoin pool, $750 BUSD and borrowed 1 ETH. 

there was a difference in interest rates on the two sides, with Annex charging 10% to borrow USDT and Venus giving 25% interest rate on supplying USDT. 

So I moved my BNB borrowing to Annex without any problems, withdrew my BUSD from Venus and deposited them to Annex without any issues at all. 

Then I decided to borrow $2k USDT from Annex to supply them at Venus, and that's where shit hit the fan, the $2k USDT never made it to my account, and I'm told by the admin of the Annex Telegram group that I my wallet is compromised. 

Here's the transaction hash:

I'm now stuck with an Annex account with 95% borrow limit utilised and all my money stuck, and well lost I assume. 

If there anything I can do? 
Can any of you help me with what I might have approved that I need to revoke in order to be able to somehow maybe salvage some of my money? 
As stupid as it sounds the $5k I had in that wallet is all the savings I had, and I am severely fucked right now."
12/3/23,To those people who carry around their hardware wallet on their keychain,"Why? I never understood this practice. How often are you sending transactions and can't they wait until you get home? Why not just load up a small amount in a hot wallet on your phone to make payments on the go if you need to?

I'm super paranoid when it comes to people knowing that they may be able to steal something from me. My debit cards even have RFID sheaths and I hardly ever carry cash. Seeing a hardware wallet on someone's keychain just screams ""I have crypto!!"" Do you not feel you are making yourself a target to anyone who might want to test just how much you are holding? Granted, not many people know what a Ledger is, but those who do, know you are not dropping $100 on a hardware wallet to hodl $100 worth of BTC.

Help me to understand this seemingly risky behavior and why I shouldn't toss the keychain attachment that came with my Ledger."
12/3/23,"Never use your main wallet with all your crypto for anything. It is not worth the risk. Create new wallet for whatever you want to do (buy, sell, use some site etc.).","I can't understand why so many people risk their crypto like last fools by using their main wallet. If you have thousands or even tens or hundreds thousands dollars in wallet stop the fuck using it for anything. It is your treasure chest, your safe. No smart guy walk with their safe, with $100k inside, on their back to the shop, they instead use wallet with few hundreds  inside. No one smart use their main bank card with all their lifesavings to pay for groceries or online shopping (if you do so also stop). So why are you using your main wallet?

In crypto where you can for FREE create unlimited amount of wallets you have no excuse you lazy gambler.
If anything bad happen, phishing site, evil contract you will lose everything and no amount of crying will turn back time.

Your main wallet should be be hardware wallet  with just BTC and ETH probably, but that's beyond the point. Even with software wallet rule stay the same. Keep max 5% or 10% of your crypto in wallet you use. If you want to do something really stupid transfer enough crypto to brand new wallet. Crypto you HODL is non touchable at all. Probably also should be divided between few wallets just in case. Better lost 25% or 33% of your  holded crypto  than all, right? You have no excuse to be irresponsible beyond laziness. Creating new wallet and writing down seedphrase is less than 10 minutes of work.


Stop begging hackers and scammers to steal all your crypto at once. Don't use your main wallet for everything it is not safe. Crypto is about decentralisation, by having just one wallet you are not much better than bank, one wrong contract signed and you will never forgive yourself  for losing all your crypto.

Your main wallet can be used only to transfer crypto to your other wallets or to exchange. Nothing more. Less you interact with it safer it become. Safe in homes of rich people are hidden, under carpet or behind painting, your wallet should be hidden behind your other wallets."

12/3/23,"While many of us here ask ""wen gen 3?"", I'd like to share some valuable reddit avatar tools that you may find useful","I've had a few people here in the comments ask me about things like avatar portfolio trackers and where to buy/sell certain avatar collections, so below is a short list of Reddit avatar tools I find useful:

Top of the list for me is the [avatardegen](https://avatardegen.io) website. This features floor prices and recent sales, with direct links to all the gen 1, 2, and wsb avatars. There are fake reddit avatars on OpenSea, so using the correct links will help to keep you safe (the genuine avatars will always have the OpenSea verified blue tick).

The site also has a portfolio feature, so by pasting your public wallet address you can see what your avatars are worth (free avatars aren't currently included, with the exception of wsb). This is perfectly safe. Your wallet address is already public and you don't need to connect your wallet to the site.

Another fun tool is the [reddit avatar explorer](https://www.redditavatarexporter.com) which allows you to view and download your current avatar on to other avatar backgrounds. So even though *The Hands* might be out of your budget, you can still take a look at what your avatar would look like on The Hands background and pretend you own it, while crying because you don't (that's what I do anyway).

[Avatar market cap](https://avatarmcap.com/) allows you to view the market cap of all the avatars, including the free ones, with links to OpenSea. It also has a portfolio tracker.

And finally [redditavatars.io](https://www.redditavatars.io) is a great resource for showing stats of % unique owners, daily volume, and some helpful guides.

[Snooavatars](https://snoovatars.com) send email notifications about when a particular avatar you may be interested in becomes listed on OpenSea. The creator also said there will be a notification sent when gen 3 is dropped in the shop, although this is a paid premium feature.

There are also helpful guides in the avatar trading sub.

**Bonus tip:** You can make sure your bank card works with Reddit *before* gen 3 drops by purchasing a small amount of reddit coins. If the transaction is successful, you should be good to go (be aware that some banks may freeze your card if you make multiple transactions in quick succession). Some people also suggest using Google play credits, although I haven't tried this myself.

Please feel free to share any avatar resources or tips that I may have missed in the comments.

Anyway…when gen 3?"
12/3/23,South Dakota Governor Vetoes Bill That Excludes Crypto From Acceptable Forms of Money,
12/3/23,Good and bad scenarios for Monday morning?,"Banks will open on Monday morning.

**Peg restored (Likely/Hopefully)**

As Circle starts redemptions at $1, arbitrageurs will buy below $1 everywhere they can and redeem with Circle. USDC returns from 0.9x to 1. The peg is restored, first of USDC then of DAI. 

The order books in the few exchanges with stablecoin/fiat pairs have a few million at each cent (0.94 0.95..), whereas Circle claims its intact reserves are in the tens of billions. 

Everything is back to normal, irrespective of what happens with SVB.

&#x200B;

**Bank Run Scenarios**

When Circle confirmed they will redeem, it went back to near 0.98 but then... falling again. 

The bank run will require people to attempt to redeem 90% of the supply, which is unlikely. Circle then will need to not have the 90% of reserves it claims to, or fail to redeem smoothly. Even rumors, FUD from influencers, or poor communication can trigger bank runs in such situations. 

It is hard to estimate just how leveraged DeFi (and leveraged trading itself and margins) is in the assumption of the pegs of USDC and DAI - this explains why it fell so hard even though Circle claims some 10% of its reserves are affected. People don't want to risk extreme scenarios on bank open Monday. CEX orderbooks are smaller than Circle reserves, but we don't know just how big the size of stablecoin holders that want peace of mind is (plus its not just USDC anymore), they may redeem. If shorters go all in and panic spreads, Circle's reserves could be tested. 

Still more unlikely but if channels to convert to fiat close (some exchanges already have closed it 'temporarily') we could see the reserves tested even if the peg is restored. Panicking people may just want to get to fiat. Lot of stables will move to BTC etc - this probably already explains why BTC price did not nosedive and instead went up.

Did I get something wrong? Anything else that could happen on Monday?"

12/3/23,Crypto is stressful as all hell,"Only been involved since 2021 but even so i feel like i've been sucker punched, beatdown, almost killed. I lost 80% of my crypto to Celsius. Then voyager, blockfi all the rest started collapsing. Luna prior to that... then SBF tanking the whole market, bunch of people lost money there.. constant murmurings of usdt going under.. now usdc is depegging and collapsing... kucoin being sued.. binance under fire...  


When does it stop? Like typing all this out seems almost comical. It's the god damn wild wild west and congratulations if you don't lose your hard earned money. Then on top of that, crypto is a breeding ground for scammers and people trying to take your money. The average joe would never survive being in crypto. It takes people who actually do their due diligence in learning how to be safe and even then... You still might lost it all.   


Nothing else like it, man... we're all insane."

12/3/23,Why it might be worth loading up on ETH and MATIC ahead of the Gen 3 launch 🚀,"So first of all, this is not financial advice as I don’t know what’s going to happen on Monday with the whole Silvergate/SVB fiascos. 

Although, there’s been a fair amount of money thrown about for Reddit collectible avatars. If there is a massive price dip for ETH and MATIC then it might be time to consider buying. 

ETH will be used for the prices of the avatars and MATIC will be used for gas fees. However, all of this will be happening on the Polygon network so expect some people to be buying MATIC to swap to WETH via MetaMask. What does this mean? For a short while MATIC will be overvalued as it’s hard to say how much of the Polygon coin will be spent on the actual prices of the avatars or gas fees. To add further confusion some of the prices of the avatars will also be fully priced as MATIC along with the gas fees (this is mainly true for lower prices). 

Another caveat to watch out for; There will be a free giveaway of Reddit collectibles known as a Starter Pack. This should provide a mini bump in profits and usage of MATIC whilst Generation 3 should generate  a surge for the value of both MATIC and ETH with the value of these cryptocurrencies being valued at a much higher price. 

If you are already DCAing MATIC and ETH then congrats on not being a complete degenerate/ day trader). Unless there is some kind of system wide domino effect run on crypto and finance in general a la 2008)."

12/3/23,Boomer Money... 15 Years From Now,"I had an interesting conversation the other day with a colleague as we chatted about crypto, and to a lesser extent the world economy. But it didn't get interesting until he mentioned the mass influx of inheritances the world will receive in the next 10-15 years. Boomer money.

He brought up Boomers, by far, have the vast amount of wealth right now, and for the most part they are living off traditional pensions and stock investments - not crypto. Crypto is too risky for a generation in their twilight years, so they have largely stayed away from it.

His prediction is we will see a mass investment into riskier investments, such as tech - AI, crypto, metaverse, etc - because it is the generations next in line that are driving these markets. This in turn will bring more people into the space, thus making the space less risky, if not risky at all.

And that got me to thinking. I don't want to go into the exact numbers, but my siblings and I should inherit a nice chunk of money from our parents when they pass, so I started ""spending"" the money in my head. X amount of dollars towards real estate. X amount toward traditional stocks. X amount to payoff any existing debts, etc. 

When I got to the end of my imaginary spending, I had a fairly sizeable amount leftover - an amount I would put into crypto, which is more than quadruple what I have in the space currently.

So my question to you all is, will crypto receive its greatest influx of users/investors, AND most importantly fiat, after the Boomers pass away and leave behind their massive wealth?"

Jerome Powell and the fed have called an emergency meeting for Monday at 1130 am likely driven by SVB collapse.

Coinbase has suspended usdc to us dollars transfers and they will open back up Monday when the banks do as of right now.

Luckily USDC has stabilized relatively.

We will see if there is an aftermath of all this that hasn't been felt yet since this happened on a Friday.

Here is a tweet that says FDIC is taking care of buisness.

https://twitter.com/BobEUnlimited/status/1634599211785134081?t=B4LR8tQQ9phhmMvrklMiOg&s=19

Tuesday is cpi data day. This will have a significant impact on the feds decision to hike rates faster for longer. Wednesday is ppi day which will also impact the fed greatly.

The following week on March 22nd we will have the rate increase which markets are priced in at .25 but expecting a possible .5 increase. A .5 increase would confirm we are getting hammered with higher increase for longer like Jerome led on.

On a positive note for bitcoin, money flowing out of stables could be going in to btc. Which is why the price is increasing slowly despite all of this.

Stay safe out there. Self custody your bitcoin.

12/3/23,"Am I the only one who actually enjoys unsustainable businesses like USDC, SVB or Silvergate falling, even if they temporarily drag Crypto prices down too?","It is that time of the year again where we had became so bullish that such an bearish event hits hard and drags all the prices down, it is always a certain black swan event where an unsustainable business model in Crypto (or outside) gets exposed and falls out. This time it was Silvergate and Silicon Valley Bank, two major banks that also had exposure to Crypto.

But in contrast to all other people that are in complete fear because their portfolio value is dropping with it, I actually enjoy it. Call me crazy, but I like it when such business models get exposed and drop as essentially all of them were scams and bad for the market.

&#x200B;

[Silvergate Stock -99&#37; drawdown as an example ](https://preview.redd.it/okvxzpntqdna1.jpg?width=2200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5ab08318216dc60bc42f26ae8cc4dd92b4d1c701)

SVB and Silvergate, even if they were crypto-friendly, we can not deny that especially Silvergate had made plays that made it inevitable for them to fall down one day. I am just happy that it is today.

Now I do not care about the short-term price drawdown there may be in Crypto due to that or the contagion hitting USDC or anyone else. The fact is still that in the long-term Crypto will adjust itself again with new and better partners and maybe people will even learn and restructure the market entirely for the good.

If you feel fear right now, look out of the charts and just feel how no matter what, the next ETH smart contract is been executed and the next Bitcoin block is being inevitably mined."
12/3/23,Where and what is next for MOONS?,"With the price of moons at time of posting at $0.234, Total marketcap at $23.9M and the TVL at 422K and slowly growing as stated on [CCMOONS](https://ccmoons.com/)

How are you seeing the future of MOONS? What do you want to see next? There are so many possibilities. Currently in a Bearmarket our beloved MOON is holding up pretty strong and growing in publicity with more and more articles from crypto newspapers and more companies/projects noticing the community we building on the sub and even using the new usecase we got for moons THE BANNER advertisement. If you look at the MOON chart we are up alot (46.4%) in the last month while the rest of the market is struggeling with recent events happening. 

[1 Month MOON chart](https://preview.redd.it/v43ffzbtg7na1.png?width=1868&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d76ebbd344ce78c206c80d1fc8e281f1da9fb147)

So whats next for MOONS? if you ask me there is alot off upside to our coin with it not being listed on alot or big exchanges a $1 MOON is not that far away as we tought/dreamed off. Last bullmarket we were just a coin with no real usecases topping $.35. So what is gonna stop us now from not flying past that $1 mark next bullrun with more and more people coming in and more usecases/lisiting coming our way.

What would you like to see next for MOONS as in usecases,proposals,prices that can really lift MOONS to another level. I am curious to the opinion of you guys let me know in the comments maybe we can come up with some new usecase or proposal that will be implemented in the future.

12/3/23,Do you think Vitalik Buterin is taking advantage of the depeg or gambling?,"The address which belongs to Vitalik has deposited 500 ETH in Reflexer Protocol to mint 150k RAI, and swapped 132.5k RAI for 378.5k USDC. Additionally, they swapped 17.5k RAI for 50k DAI.

Do you think Vitalik is gambling or is he profiting from the current situation by making sure that the stablecoins that are depeged will reach to the peg of $1 again?

In my opinion, his move shows USDC and DAI have a nice mechanism behind it that will lead to the redemption of the $1 peg certainly. Now all eyes are on Circle's Monday move."
12/3/23,"Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twenty times…","How many more warnings do people need to move their coins off exchanges? 

It’s unlikely that many people here were around for the fall of Mt Gox. However, it’s probably safe to say that most people here were around for, or are at least aware of, the FTX collapse. So everybody here should be well aware of the risk that they might lose anything they hold on an exchange without warning. If this is a significant amount of value/investment for you, then you are taking massive risks in an industry already fraught with risk.

I know there is a lot of what people would call “FUD” around exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, but even if none of it is true - and as we’ve seen, sometimes it is - why take the risk? What benefit are you getting, during a bear market when most people are simply hodling and/or dcaing? Is connecting your cold wallet once a month to move your new DCA to it really such a hardship? In a bull market when you might want to sell at any moment (a concept that seems alien to many of us with huge red dildos right now), I can see *some* benefit, but even then the time it takes to connect your wallet shouldn’t have a huge impact on your decision to sell.

Unless you are day trading and need to have constant access to your crypto, or your portfolio is worth less than the price of a Ledger or Trezor (for example, other wallets are available), there really are no downsides to having self-custody of your crypto. A cold wallet is anything but. It makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside, it takes care of you and your ~~gambling~~ *investment*, and it doesn’t steal your funds when it goes bankrupt and run off to the Bahamas to have relations with a goat woman.

The recent scares around Silvergate and USDC have the potential, however slim, to cause great waves across the market, which could potentially see other exchanges struggle and go under. It may all be a storm in a teacup, who knows? But we’ve had enough warnings now; if at this point you still take the risk and lose your crypto to a failed exchange, you have nobody else to blame.

So, TLDR: There are only so many times you can be warned before it’s your own fault for not moving your crypto off an exchange and taking self-custody. Take action now, thank yourself later."

Have you been affected by any of these cases? In how many, in which ones?

&#x200B;

In my case i swapped some USDC to UST 2 months before the Luna meltdown, and when things started to fall apart i swapped back to USDC and losted near 1.x%, if i take the 2 months farming i didnt got hit, and i got that luna airdrop that still goes monthly a little bit of it. On the other big cases of FTX or Voyager or other exchanges i didnt got hit, but i have a good friend that losted a big amount, near 30% of his portfolio, and you can hear stories all the time. Now with the USDC drama we are living i swapped all my USDC to USDT on Friday, losing very little like 0.1% becase i was fast at seeing what was going on. But majority of people werent on twitter checking the live news...

I feel that in most of the cases you have some hours before things go crazy, in some cases even more time. For example FTX had 10 days since the Coindesk article hit to their meltdown, but in those 10 days most of the people were thinking ah FTX its too big, it wont fall down, but then it did.

Time matters in getting out, and it feels stressing that you need to stay vigilant every day so your money dont disapear :/

12/3/23,Biggest stablecoins have normalized again - but how safe are they?,"During the last days this sub and crypto Twitter were in doomsday mode. It's finally happening! No, it was not. The depeg was temporary. Still: some of our stables are ""backed"" by other stables or even cryptocurrencies - it does not take much imagination to find out that this could lead to a death spiral.

# How are the 5 biggest stables backed?

(You can't be 100% sure in this space, but that's the info as far as we know)

1. USDT - Backed by cash, money market funds, U.S. Treasury bills, commercial papers, corporate bonds, loans, ***other investments including digital currencies.*** ([source](https://tether.to/en/transparency/#reports))
2. USDC - Fiat-backed, reserves are kept in the custody of leading U.S. financial institutions. ([source](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/how-does-usdc-work/))
3. BUSD - Binance USD, secured by the regulatory framework of the New York state Department of Financial Services, backed by reserves held either in fiat cash and/or U.S. Treasury bills.
4. DAI - ""\[...\] **collateralized by multiple stablecoins and cryptocurrencies**."" ([source](https://thedefiant.io/what-is-dai))
5. TUSD - (""True USD"") showed in an [audit](https://cointelegraph.com/news/trueusd-audit-shows-full-us-dollar-backing) that it's fully backed by USD.

# What's the big deal?

Imagine we have a crash where cryptocurrencies lose 50% of their market capitalization (nothing unusual). Most investors will sell their tokens for stables, but due to missing trust a lot will cash out for fiat. That's a problem if your stablecoin is backed by cryptocurrencies: they are now worth 50% less (in average), meaning that your stable will only be around 50% backed. Depegging stables can also make other stables depeg, leading to a death spiral.

Please let me know your thoughts. That's not financial advice, but I'm staying away from stablecoins, (traders don't have this option though).

12/3/23,Decentralisation should be the NUMBER ONE priority of cryptocurrencies.,"Greetings from Portugal!

Decentralisation should be the number priority of cryptocurrencies.

People speak a lot about the function of decentralization in cryptocurrencies. Decentralization, in my opinion, must be the ultimate goal cryptocurrency.

Even for those who are into crypto only because of the money (most of us, nothing wrong on that), YOU WILL HAVE MORE MONEY TO SPENT. (Less fees compared to banks, smoother impact of inflation, etc.)

BlockChains without decentralization are absurd from a developer's point of view. Removing decentralization to make blockchain faster is just a really bad Database implementation.

The essential aspect of a cryptocurrency is its decentralised nature; all other features, like as high speed, low fees, and any other amazing technical innovations, are merely ways to improve it.

I would love to hear the community's thoughts on this!

The software I used to file taxes last year along with every other company in crypto went bankrupt last year, so I have to find new software. Yay me.

So, I do my research to find that pretty much all crypto tax software is going to cost a shit ton, but I'm not about to manually start filling out the tax forms, so I find the least expensive option which seems to be TaxBit. It will still cost more than the one I used last year, but I don't really have to many options. Yay me.

I start adding sources on TaxBit. Some go through very smoothly and there's absolutely no issue importing. Other's, you follow the instructions to a tee and it just refuses to cooperate. Yay me. 

It then compiles a long list of assets that it's saying there is no source for them and asking to justify a hundred different instances it can't figure out what to do with. On top of it, it doesn't know how to read a CSV file and asks you to restructure everything to fit however it is capable of reading. Yay me.

Oh yeah, and a lot of exchanges are extra and won't just give you the information you need. I need ALL of my transactions Kucoin, not just 100 days worth. Yay me. 

Why must this be so tedious and complicated? We can put a man on the moon, but we can't make taxes easy to report?

1. Always keep your large chunk of funds in a multisig hardware wallet, never connect it to any DEX or interact with smart contract, your main wallet should be only for storing crypto and offline as much as possible. 
2. For any other purpose just create junk wallet where you can do whatever the hell you want. Experiment with dexes, smart contracts etc. but even with this take some precautions.

12/3/23,Don't Let Hackers Get Your Crypto: The Importance of Using Different Passwords and 2FA,"Many websites require you to create a username and password to access their services. However, what most people don't realize is that these websites store your login information in a database that can be accessed by hackers or even by the website's own administrators.

There have been instances where web administrators or hackers have gained access to these databases and used the login information to try and log in to other websites using the same email and password combination.

This is particularly dangerous for crypto-related websites, where a single breach can result in the loss of all your assets. Therefore, it is essential to use different passwords for different websites, especially those related to crypto.

Moreover, enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) provides an extra layer of security to your account. By doing so, you can ensure that even if someone gets hold of your password, they won't be able to log in without the second factor, such as a code sent to your phone.

Stay safe and secure online, and always take the necessary steps to protect your valuable assets!"

12/3/23,It's always 'too late',"I remember hearing about bitcoin back in the early days and being used on the dark web and the whole thing seemed way to hard, besides the prices were steadily rising and I figured it wasn't worth it. 

Then a couple of years later a workmates was heavily into it and wouldn't stop telling us all about how it was the next big thing, it all seemed too complicated to purchase in New Zealand at the time as there were no local exchanges established and it involved wiring money overseas. 

Then came the crash at the end of 2017 and we figured it was all over anyway. 

In the bear run we stuck to stocks as it seemed a lot easier. And now it's 2023 and people are still saying 'it's a phase' or 'it's going to die out'. If I'd jumped on board at any point where people were saying 'this is the end' it would've gone a lot better than any other holding.

Having said all that the recent years accessibility has improved dramatically in the country which is maybe something that's taken for granted a bit in the US.

I still wonder about that Co worker from 2016 who was heavily invested in crypto, hopefully it all paid of for him and it was a success story, he was a pretty cool guy."
12/3/23,"Forget all ""trust me bro"" shit and just buy bitcoin, store in hardware wallet. Analysis of level of ""trust me bro""-ness in different assets.","We are at a point this year where the amount of bankruptcies, scams, hacks, rug pulls, etc. is out of control.

The main question you need to ask yourself when you put your money into something it's the degree of ""trust me bro""-ness.

In essence, how much control over my assets am I giving to someone else? The problem is that slowly we have become less and less self-sovereign since Satoshi's invention, and we are giving more and more power to third parties. Which is essentially what Satoshi's was trying to avoid.

Most new cryptos, new websites, new defi platforms, are only created with one purpose: to make money. And more explicitly: to make money out of you.  You need to ask yourself, how many levels of ""trust me bro"" I need to go down to use this platform? For example, let's say you have some ""tokens"" in some defi platform: you need to trust the token creator not to rug pull, you need to trust the defi contracts not to have security holes and be hacked. You need to trust the platform not to have mev bots or liquidators that will fuck you up and take your money (see that example of the guy who lost $2 mill and got $0.05 on a dodgy swap). There are so many layers of ""trust me bro""-ness that there's no way you can sleep well at night.

Here's a short list of assets (doesn't contain all types), but it you want to be in crypto with the lowest degree of ""trust me bro""-ness, you need bitcoin in a hardware wallet. It's been running over 10 years, it doesn't have smart contracts that can be hacked, it doesn't have dodgy web3 pages that will make you sign some scam contract and steal all your money.

Some examples of assets, from less to more ""trust me bro""-ness:

1. **Physical gold**, stored at home in a safe. Yes, you have the ""trust me bro"" problem of not knowing exactly the amount of total gold being mined, etc. But gold has been used for thousands of years to store value. And you don't depend on a state currency that can be printed and printed.
2. **Hard cash** from a low inflation western country (dollars, euro, swiss francs, etc.). The government of such country will tell you ""trust me bro"" I won't print too much money and make it less valuable
3. Cash from 2 in a **bank**. The bank will tell you ""trust me bro"" your deposits are safe, the money it's covered by the government deposit guarantee. 
4. **Bitcoin**, stored in a hardware wallet. Now some could argue that this has even less ""trust me bro""-ness and 2 and 3, given you don't depend on a central bank. But the technology has only been around for around 10 years. But the fact is that it keeps working: blocks keep being created and this can give you a good level of confidence. Also this is the original cryptocurrency, it has the first mover advantage, and it's way ahead of competition. 
5. **Ethereum**, in hardware wallet. Second crypto, it has a reason to exist (to add smart contracts to a cryptocurrency). I was an eth maximalist in the last few years. But the move to PoS means that all those original eth holders (ethereum foundation, ethdev, etc.) now will get a much larger percentage of staking fees than anyone else (the rich getting richer). Also it has the problem of the vast a mount of fucking dodgy smart contracts and shit tokens.
6. **Other L1** coins (cardano, etc.). You need to ask yourself what's the reason for these to exist, do they add any great functionality that doesn't exist in bitcoin & ethereum?
7. Ethereum **L2**. I trusted L2s in the past, operated a lot in arbitrum, matic, etc. I ran an arbitrum node for a while, but there was no way for me to get any of the fees which felt strange. So there's the ""trust me bro"" of the people of the L2, where you have deposited your eth via a bridge. A bridge than can be hacked. Will you be able to get your L2 back to L1 in a year? In 10 years? A lot of ""trust me bro""s.
8. **Stablecoins**. These are erc-20 tokens, defined by a contract, that can have a security hole, can be hacked. In the case of usdc, it has a backdoor and they can freeze your coins whenever they can. You also need the ""trust me bro"" promise that they keep 1$ of each released token. 
9. Other **erc-20 tokens**. Created of of thin air by the people who wrote the contract, you need to trust them not to print more, not to rug pull and sell their (large) holdings, etc.
10. **Defi products**. Now here you are compounding the risk and ""trust me bro""-ness of the stables and erc-20 shit, with the risks of the Defi smart contracts (that are constantly being hacked) plus the MEV bots that are scanning the mempool for transactions (like sharks waiting for victims) and will frontrun you and make you lose money. 
11. **Cefi** banks / websites. We give them total control of our crypto (100% trust me bro) but then even worse, they go and gamble it on several other layers of ""trust me bro""-ness by using 10. This is probably the extreme level of ""trust me bro""-ness.

I get that we are geeks that like to play around  with new technologies, we get a feel of satisfaction when we get a new tool working (i.e. metamask), but we need to ask ourselves, how many layers of  ""trus me bro""-ness are we adding to the original bitcoin whitepaper? If you like to geek out, install bitcoin core, run your node, practice sending transactions, etc. If you are still bored, install a lightning node in your bitcoin node, add some channels, start managing it, use a bitcoin wallet in your phone like walletofsatoshi, bluewallet, etc. Make lightning payments to friends and family. Explore nostr and zapping... There's a whole world out there of crypto where you are self-sovereign and you keep control of all of your assets, trusting no one.

Let's go back to basics."
12/3/23,MakerDAO files emergency proposal addressing 3.1B USDC exposure,
12/3/23,Strategy analysis- Is there a better choice than DCA? Introducing weighted DCA.," 

# Introduction

Everyone knows that DCA and HOLD is the king of crypto investing. Everyone loves it for lack of unnecessary emotional involvement with your investment and simplicity.

But what if there is better way to become a whale of cryptocurrency world? What if there is secret sauce that lays in the open just before our eyes?

&#x200B;

Goal of this analysis is to prove or disprove superiority of weighted DCA strategy over standard DCA.

# Essentials

*What is weighted DCA?*

Weighted DCA (thats how i named it, maybe there will be better alternative in the comments) is strategy that is variant of standard DCA with one simple change. In addition to buying at the market price every week you also set limit orders at some % below market price.

So, how it works exactly? Example -20%

1. You split your weekly DCA into 5 parts
2. One part you buy at the market price and other four part are going into limit orders 5,10,15,20% below market price.
3. After a week either your orders get fulfilled or not. Unfulfilled orders are canceled and added to next week DCA fund.
4. Spilt into 5 parts again.

Example on numbers:

Bitcoin at 31 December 2021 was traded at 100'000$ (totally random date and price )  and week later price dropped to 90k$. You DCA 100$ every week.

1. Your orders 20$ at 100k, 20$ at 95k, 20$ at 90k, 20$ at 85k and 20$ at 80k.
2. After a week you have to unfulfilled orders at 85k and 80k for sum total 40$, you cancel them and add to this week DCA.
3. So now you have 140$ (100$ weekly plus 40$ from unfullfilled orders) - you split them again to 5 parts (28$) and place orders at market price and -5,10,15,20%.

Isn't it timing the market? Maybe, but put down your pitchforks and wait for results before you lynch me.

# Excel time!!!

*Data*

Data i used for analysis come from [https://www.investing.com/crypto/bitcoin/historical-data](https://www.investing.com/crypto/bitcoin/historical-data).

I calculated 3 different time periods (5 years, 2 years and 1 year) and 3 strategy variants (-20%, -15% and -10%). Data used starts from 4 March 2018 and ends at February 26 2023. Weekly DCA amount is 100$ in all variants presented.

That's how my excel is looking. I know ugly af, but it works.

[Ugly af excel sheet ;\(](https://preview.redd.it/e0e8nbjgabna1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ef02953690304b1d7bc3f4c7a1f8b8df96121d09)

# Results

So it's time. The tension and grant finale. Let's present the results.

[5 years Bitcoin accumulation graph](https://preview.redd.it/sa25u4rjbbna1.png?width=1072&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6841d024e72fb78552a0ab44df289dd1409224ee)

Most successful variant of strategy tested was -20%/5 parts DCA with results of:

* 4,23% gain compared to standard DCA at 5 year period
* 5,25% gain compared to standard DCA at 2 year period
* 4,86% gain compared to standard DCA at 1 year period

Second best was -15%/4 parts DCA with results of:

* 3,91% gain compared to standard DCA at 5 year period
* 4,70% gain compared to standard DCA at 2 year period
* 4,54% gain compared to standard DCA at 1 year period

Last was -10%/3 parts DCA with results Of:

* 2,92% gain comapred to standard DCA at 5 year period
* 3,53% gain comapred to standard DCA at 2 year period
* 2,87% gain compared to standard DCA at 1 year period

**Conclusion**

The results are pointing that this approach would make significant gains in the past, but we need to remember that  past results don't guarantee same results in the future. 

My toughs:

There's no much difference between -15% and -20% approach and there was only 8 times when price dropped more than -20% in a week in 5 years, 1 time in last 2 years and 0 in last year . In my opinion there  -15% approach could be most profitable in the future, as crypto markets are becoming more and more mature and less volatile.

It would be nice to know  your thoughts about this and if u want me to make more post like that.

TLDR: Looks like it is worth time spend, but without crystal ball who knows?"

A user here lost 270.000 because of that, and I saw on twitter someone losing 500k in the exact same way. I was wondering, do you guys really use your cold wallet as a cold wallet? (And by that, I mean using it only for holding stuff and maybe delegating your tokens, because this is how it should be used in my head)

I bought a hardware wallet to hold my stuff this year and I have never felt safer. For those who like to interact with random contracts using your cold wallet, what makes you confident to do that? Maybe I am missing something, idk."

12/3/23,"Those of you who sold during a huge dip, why did you do that?","Hey friends. In this sub we have this joke *buy high sell low*, but obviously we all keep telling other people to buy during the dips. However, there are people that practice the golden rule of doing the opposite of what this sub says. So if this sub says to buy the dip maybe there are people who have sold before. 

Most of the times it is hard to predict whether the prices will go up or down. In this case, everyone agrees that the price is going to dip even further. So I'd like to know, those of you who have sold during a huge dip, what made you do so? Was it an emergency or were you hoping the price to go even further?"
12/3/23,Litecoin,"Litecoin is one of the first alt-coins, founded in October 2011. Litecoin has often been referred to as digital silver. It is one of the oldest cryptocurrencies in the upper echelon of market capitalization and has many similarities to Bitcoin. One of the world's first successful alt-coins, since it is based on Bitcoin's source code, both cryptocurrencies work similarly in terms of their mechanisms, including the proof-of-work consensus mechanism and the halving cycle. Therefore, just like Bitcoin, Litecoin's mining rewards are halved every four years, with the current halving happening this year **on or around Aug. 3, 2023** 

Litecoin uses an open-source blockchain that isn't controlled by any central authority.

**Litecoin is four times faster than Bitcoin**

* It has been shown that this crypto network processes transactions four times faster than Bitcoin. Litecoin's block generation time is estimated at 2.5 minutes, while Bitcoin's is 10 minutes. That's a big difference. 

Apart from the encryption algorithms, this tweak may be the most significant technical difference between Bitcoin and Litecoin. This makes Litecoin a perfect cryptocurrency for small and quick transactions.

With an 84 million circulating supply, Litecoin has four times as many as Bitcoin. This means it is more convenient and accessible for users to earn more profits through mining, as well due in part by the decrease in Bitcoin mining rewards and overtime it'll make Litecoin a better option.

\-*LTC is accepted by merchants including BitPay, Travala, and others. In January 2023, 3,070 merchants accepted Litecoin as payment. This is a significant number. This rapid adoption makes Litecoin one of the leading cryptocurrency investments with real-world applications.*

*In January 2023, the Litecoin Foundation claimed that Visa would enable holders to spend LTC via the Litecoin Card.*

If anything the argument can be made crypto is safer.

If you look at all the recent collapses, even mortgage loan banks 15 years ago, it was examples of human failures and in most cases were criminal — even FTX.  Human failures.

Crypto however, is just technology.  It has no nefarious motives.  It just balances accounts and isn’t looking for some slick way to generate money.  That is why crypto moving forward can solve century old problems in the world of finance.  Take the human element away, and allow blockchain to work."
12/3/23,Understanding the Potential of Private Smart Contracts: Real-World Applications of ZK-Proofs and TEEs in Crypto.,"*Created a post similar to this a few days ago. Added some extra ideas this time in the hope that it gains a bit more traction which in turn would hopefully lead to more examples/ideas of how to implement this tech.*

Wanted to provide a number of examples that show what **ZK-proofs** (zero-knowledge proofs) and especially **TEEs** (trusted execution environments) can mean for the crypto space. I feel like examples are important and left out too much when talking about new tech. Some examples may be similar, would be nice if people could come up with more examples in the comments.

&#x200B;

1. **Undercollateralized or variable rate lending.** Borrower reputation can be established via private data such as credit history. Those with a good reputation can get loans using less collateral and/or loans with lower interest rates.
2. **MEV-resistant DEXs.** Important aspects of orders such as slippage parameters can be kept private from even the nodes themselves, preventing them from manipulating orders and/or frontrunning. This allows users to keep more of the value of their trades.
3. **Privacy-preserving decentralized identity.** Also called anonymous credentials. This could allow people to, for example, satisfy KYC/AML laws without revealing their entire identity to everyone. This can also allow dApps to screen users based on e.g. age or country.
4. **Confidential NFTs.** The owner of an NFT gains access to private data such as an image. This could be used to enhance the value of owning an NFT since not every aspect of the token is available publicly.
5. **Confidential voting.** This could be especially useful for DAOs. It allows for votes to be held in which voters are not influenced by the votes that were submitted before them.
6. **Collaborative analytics.** For example, multiple companies or individuals could pool their data and perform a privacy-preserving analysis whose results are only shared within a certain audience. Since data is only analyzed within a TEE, there is less chance for a data leak.
7. **Games with hidden on-chain state.** Example: puzzle games in which there is an answer that must be kept from the player. Another example: Games in which players act on information that cannot be revealed to other players.
8. **Games that rely on random number generation.** Through the use of TEEs to generate random numbers without an external oracle. Gambling games could make use of this (rolling a die). RPGs could incorporate this as well.
9. **An info leak marketplace.** Leakers can upload private information. The leaker can choose to sell it to one, several, or many people. They can also set a fundraising threshold past which they will reveal the secret to everyone. Leaker's reputation can be based on ratings.
10. **Proof-of-humanity.** A privacy-preserving user verification system can be implemented that proves a user is human based on uploaded ID documents or attestations from trusted institutions/companies. This could be useful on any dApp that wants to exclude bots.
11. **More fair auctions.** VCG, second price, and candle auctions are examples of more fair auction methods that require privacy.
12. **Prediction markets for crowdsourced data.** Imagine sending out a survey to people asking a list of questions. After everyone submits the survey, they can bet on the results of this survey. E.g. ""What is the most popular response to X? How do you predict X to relate to Y?""
13. **Biomedical data marketplace.** Biometric data from wearing a smartwatch, demographic data, genomic data, blood work data, etc. all could be uploaded and protected so that only owners of the data can control who accesses it. Data analysts could pay data owners for access.
14. **Family Tree DAO.** A type of Data DAO that stores family information like genome sequences, photos/videos and medical records. Data can be kept private within the family and passed down through the generations.
15. **Initial Data Offering (IDO)**. Any endeavor with the potential to yield valuable data could sell rights to future data revenue in order to raise funds. Studies, polls, surveys, Data DAOs, new data-generating products or applications, etc. could all raise money this way.
16. **Data science competitions for private data.** This would be a decentralized version of Kaggle, which allows people to offer datasets that competitors can analyze in order to win reward money. For private data, all analyses would be performed within a TEE, preserving privacy.

Hopefully, this has been helpful to some people in understanding why private smart contracts are the most important thing to get right in the next few years. **Important to note is that most of the ideas presented can only be implemented with TEEs.**"
12/3/23,"Macro ""Experts"" compare history and draw rather gloomy conclusions, but they overlooked one factor: social media and the growing knowledge","Yea, I know...the macro economy doesn't look well and almost all so-called macro economy experts are telling us how bad it will even become.

They compare the dot-com bubble and other historical crashes, project possible similar outcomes to the situation we have now.

But they don't factor the social media and the spread of knowledge in their analysis.

In the 2000s not many people are educated yet about how the market cycles works...there were no Youtubers who shills them coins and tell them to be bullish/ hold onto their assets/ DCA/ buy the dips.

People in the past were more prone to panic sell their assets, because they didn't know it better.

But now with all the Twitter, Reddit, Youtube & others where people get (hopefully) valuable and good information, instead of panicking, they are more ""cool"".

GBTC has $12B in BTC. There's likely no player or sector with enough liquidity willing to absorb that kind of selling pressure. If their BTC hit the market tomorrow, there's nothing to prevent us going back near ATL. With the price movement compounded by liquidating longs and margin calls."

12/3/23,Insights into how stable coins depeg,"Its happened twice in my short tenure in crypto and I never bothered to really look into it. Here is a summary of how it happens and what I was able to find.

&#x200B;

There are a few types of stable coins: Fiat backed, algorithmically stablalized, and smart contracts.

The main reasons behind depegging are :  market conditions, liquidity issues and regulatory changes.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i9sfctajbdna1.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e0ccd4ae348dc62977a661e09bed1e5c805ccb54

How do these scenarios play out?

**Market Conditions-** The conditions that can cause a depeg are: sharp increase or decrease in demand of the stable coin. Also inflation and interest rates can play a role in depegging. If a large holder moves a large amount at once it can affect the peg.

**Liquidity-** If a Fiat backed coin where its stored 1 to 1 with a currency ends up losing currency or access to it, the stable coin can depeg due not truly being backed at 1 to 1 ratio. In our current scenario this is due to a bank collapse.  MakerDAO was also affected by this through contagion.  

**Regulatory Changes-** Such as a government ban on the stable coin. 

&#x200B;

**Some history-** LUNA which we are all very aware of was attached to UST which was algorithmically stablalized. Luna was depegged when "" over $2 billion worth of UST was unstaked (taken off the Anchor Protocol), and hundreds of millions of it were quickly liquidated "" This caused UST to drop to $.90 so everyone was able to trade a $.90 asset for a $1.00 asset thus breaking luna.

&#x200B;

**Summary-** One would think fiat backed stable would be stable. But if you can secure the fiat it is just as vulnerable as the other two options. You would think they would make sure to bank with the larger most established banks, but as we have all seen dumb decisions can be made every day. Even large banks F up. It seems just pare for the course, anything can happen in crypto zero to a hundred and back to zero.

Though I accumulated by DCAing so I'm not in big deep red but knowing that someone with more money invested in this world is not worried or moving his/her asset then I should chill down.

I beg pardon right now because I'm learning more about eth so the tools I have mentioned below revolve around Ethereum and its related project.

# 1) Etherscan + Dexscreener (my all-time favorite)

First, start by searching for tokens that have undergone significant price surges using [Dexscreener](https://dexscreener.com/). Once you've found these surges, note down the specific dates on which they occurred.

Next, go to [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) and enter the target token address in the search bar to access its dashboard page. Click on the ""Dex Trades"" button to see all the buys and sells that have occurred for that asset on decentralized exchanges (DEXes).

Click on the ""Action"" button and then ""View All"" to see the full list of historical DEX transactions. Hone in on the time period just before your target price surge happened to analyze the transactions.

I can go on so please explore yourself.

# 2) Context

If you are into NFT then stay up to date with NFT activities. [Context](https://context.app/) is a platform that makes it easy to monitor NFT activities from your target crypto wallets.

Impersonator is purely a visual tool for monitoring activities, as logging in to view an address doesn't permit any transactions since the system doesn't interact with private keys. Though it might sound disappointing it's fun to look around.

We can still enter a specific wallet address, such as rsa.eth or vitalik.eth, into [Impersonator](https://www.impersonator.xyz/) to gain a firsthand view of their recent crypto activities.

I know that the last couple of days was a roller coaster ride for most crypto communities and being a smallholder all I can say is we can't do anything in it so I will rather be calm than spread FUD or talk shit about my own investments.

I'm new to crypto and have just been 1 year in this industry I jumped into this because I wanted to get rich quickly. I made some and then I burned some.  I have a lot to learn and I'm trying my best to convert my mindset for a long HODL."

12/3/23,The Reddit Rollercoaster of Gaming NFTs: From Gods Unchained Hype to NFT Hate,"Last week, the crypto gaming community was buzzing about a play-to-earn card game. Many Redditors praised the game's mechanics and the ability to earn money by playing, even as a free-to-play player. However, one of this week's top threads in r/CryptoCurrency paints a very different picture. The thread discusses Square Enix's new game, Forspoken, and how many gamers feel small and mid-sized titles are not performing as expected. However, the top comments in the thread shift the conversation to NFTs, with many replies expressing hatred towards them.

It's clear that opinions on gaming NFTs are divided, but it's important to acknowledge that they do have some useful applications in gaming. Here are some compelling arguments for why gaming NFTs are worthy:

1. True Ownership: NFTs give players true ownership of their in-game assets. This means that players can buy, sell, and trade their assets as they wish, just like physical collectibles. This has the potential to create an entirely new economy within gaming, with players able to profit from their virtual assets.
2. Play-to-Earn: Play-to-earn games, like the one that was mentioned ( Gods Unchained ), offer a way for players to earn money by playing. While it's true that this may not be a substantial source of income, it's still a way for players to earn some extra crypto while enjoying their favorite games.
3. Personal Choice: Ultimately, it's up to the player to decide whether or not they want to participate in NFT gaming. Players who are interested in owning their in-game assets and earning money through play-to-earn games have the option to do so, while those who are not interested can choose to play traditional games without NFTs.
4. Play for Fun: It's important to remember that playing games should be fun, not a second job. While play-to-earn games may offer a way to earn money, it's important for players to remember that they should be playing because they enjoy the game, not just for the monetary rewards.

The gaming NFT discussion on Reddit has been a rollercoaster ride, with opinions on the topic shifting from week to week. While there are certainly valid criticisms of gaming NFTs ( people will cheat/ use bots to profit - but this is already done in other games as well, it's not like it will be something new ) , it's important to remember that they do have some useful applications in gaming, including true ownership, decentralization, and play-to-earn mechanics. Ultimately, it's up to each individual player to decide whether or not they want to participate in NFT gaming and to make that decision based on their personal preferences and values.  


  
TL;DR :  NFTs have potential benefits in gaming. It's up to the user to enjoy the game without making it feel like a second job.

12/3/23,If you could change one thing about crypto,"There’s a lot happening right now, so I thought it would be a good opportunity to take a step back and share some ideas/perspectives.

If you could instantly change one thing about cryptocurrency, blockchain or web3 in general today, what would it be and why?

Be as creative or controversial (but non-offensive) as you like.

- would you remove CEXs? Regulate them?
- would you make all project founders and CEOs anonymous and remove their ability to control chains and tokens or spread FUD and manipulate markets?
- would you pre-mine BTC and distribute it evenly among existing wallet holders?

What would you do?

I personally would love to see responses focussed on technological changes or governance, but if you just want to fill your bags I can’t argue with that logic!"
11/3/23,What Causes Stablecoins to Lose Their Peg?,
12/3/23,Ethereum smart contract crash course,"In times like this when we're all slightly nervous about TradFi events, and how they may affect crypto, it's always good to remind ourselves of the merits of cryptocurrency through some education. Here goes my contribution.

**How does Ethereum allow smart contracts?**

Ethereum was specifically designed to allow for the creation and execution of smart contracts, while Bitcoin was primarily designed as a decentralized digital currency. The key difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin is that Ethereum has a built-in programming language called *Solidity* that allows developers to write and deploy smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. Smart contracts can be used to automate and enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract, reducing the need for intermediaries and increasing efficiency and security.

While Bitcoin also has some limited scripting capabilities, they are not as powerful or flexible as the smart contracts that can be created on Ethereum. This is because Bitcoin was designed to be a more lightweight protocol, focusing primarily on ensuring the security and integrity of transactions.

**A smart contract example**

    pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
    
    contract SimpleStorage {
        uint storedData;
    
        function set(uint x) public {
            storedData = x;
        }
    
        function get() public view returns (uint) {
            return storedData;
        }
    }

This smart contract is a basic implementation of a storage contract. It contains two functions, set()  
 and get(), which allow users to set and retrieve a single unsigned integer value, respectively.

The set() function takes an input parameter x and sets the value of storedData to that value. The function is declared as public, which means that it can be called by anyone who has access to the contract.

The get() function is a public view function, which means that it can be called by anyone who has access to the contract, but it cannot modify any state variables in the contract. The function simply returns the value of storedData.

This is a very simple example, but it demonstrates the basic structure of an Ethereum smart contract and how it can be used to store and retrieve data on the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts can be used for many other purposes, such as creating decentralized applications, managing digital assets, and executing complex financial transactions.

**Example of using the set() function**

Let's say you have deployed the SimpleStorage contract to the Ethereum network, and you want to set the value of storedData to 69 using the set() function. Here is an example of how you could do that:

1. Open your web3-enabled browser and navigate to the Ethereum network where the smart contract is deployed.
2. Get the contract address of the SimpleStorage contract.
3. Use the contract address to load the smart contract interface in your wallet or browser. For example, if you are using the Metamask wallet, you can click on the ""Add Token"" button and then select ""Custom Token"".
4. In the ""Add Token"" form, enter the contract address of the SimpleStorage contract, and then fill in the token symbol as ""SSC"" and decimals as ""0"".
5. Click ""Next"" and then ""Add Tokens"" to load the SimpleStorage contract interface in your wallet.
6. Now, you can call the set() function to set the value of storedData to 69. To do this, you will need to select the SimpleStorage token in your wallet, and then click on the ""Interact with Contract"" button.
7. In the ""Interact with Contract"" form, select the set() function, enter the value 69 in the input field, and then click ""Write"".
8. In the next form, review the gas fee for calling the set() function, and then click ""Confirm"" to execute the transaction.
9. After the transaction is confirmed, you can verify that the value of storedData has been set to 69 by calling the get() function. The result should be 69.

**Using a block explorer to confirm the function call**

You can see the value 69 using a block explorer. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open a block explorer such as Etherscan or Etherchain.
2. Search for the contract address of your SimpleStorage contract.
3. On the contract page, you should see a list of all the transactions that have interacted with the contract.
4. Look for the transaction that corresponds to the call to the set() function where you set the value of storedData to 69.
5. Click on the transaction to view its details.
6. On the transaction details page, you should see a section called ""Input Data"". This section will show you the input data for the transaction, which includes the function selector and the input parameters.
7. In the ""Input Data"" section, look for the input parameter that corresponds to the value of storedData that you set. In this case, the input parameter should be ""0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000045"", which is the hexadecimal representation of the number 69.

**Concluding remarks**

Once a smart contract is deployed to the Ethereum blockchain, its code is immutable and cannot be changed. This means that no one, not even the person who deployed the contract, can alter the code or its behavior.

However, the data stored in the contract, such as the value of storedData in the SimpleStorage contract example, can be updated through the execution of functions defined in the contract. These functions can only be executed by users who have the necessary permissions and meet the conditions specified in the contract code.

This, friends, is the power of smart contracts."

I intentionally skip stable coins and meme coins. I.e. no Doge (sorry guys).

stETH has been coming up the list and today it fell into the top 7. I chose to skip over it as in my opinion it is not a token in and of itself but meant only for staking purposes. Seeing as I don’t stake anything, I chose to skip it and purchase SOL instead.

12/3/23,Merriam-Webster to redifine definition of 'stable',"After the recent fallout of Silicon Valley Bank caused a number of crypto stablecoins to depeg, Merriam-Webster has put out an official statement that they are going to change the definition of 'Stable' as it no longer fits the original definition. This follows the news that 9 of the top 10 stablecoins lost their peg [earlier today](https://coinmarketcap.com/view/stablecoin/). Here is the official announcement from Merriam-Webster:

https://preview.redd.it/5nt7ncb8rcna1.png?width=596&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=149255146d01ed5820723e0c466a291b993bafb6

This is the first instance where a depegging has caused such a reaction from the non-crypto world, and has shocked people all over. Tether was one of the first to respond to Merriam-Webster after the announcement as they were the only major stablecoin to not lose its peg

https://preview.redd.it/t6ba6779rcna1.png?width=596&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=796e3159ea5e7a1fc1f185972ffda7b4d745df16

Merriam-Webster have yet to respond to Tether, all we know as of now is that we have a new definition for the word 'stable' and by extension 'stablecoin'. Maybe given enough time they will change it back if these stablecoins manage to regain their peg."

From Do Kwon's terra luna and its stablecoin depeg to SBF and FTX collapse and now the collapse of banks and USDC and other stablecoins depegs the Crypto Industry has taken some heavy hits but as we all know it comes back stronger and it keeps moving forward.

We always talk about how the government, sec, and banks are against us and they try to fight us and slow down our progress which is inevitable it seems we also always had some problems ""inside"" the industry. While some people focus and have their attention on what our ""enemies"" may do and what their next move we fail to see the problems and dangers among us.

With all these things happening lately I only can wonder and ask: What are some of the problems we have inside the industry that we are not giving enough attention to? What dangers and threats might exist now that we fail to see? Do you believe there might be also some other ""Ticking Bomb""?

How can we prevent them? and if we can't how can we at least prepare?

I strongly believe we need to evolve further and to do that we need to track the problems and find a solution for them, of course, some things just take time but also some other things can be prevented.

Do you think there is a solution or way to track these problems? can we find them and fix them?

Thanks in advance."
12/3/23,SVB’s failure shows a small but mighty key to crypto’s success,"Lines of depositors waiting hours outside of SVB branches were plastered on the news on Friday. I feel sorry for these people - having to take a day off work only to stand in line, probably chewing their fingernails down to the bone - only to be met with a “Closed” sign when they finally make it to the front door. 

Now the ones who did not make it in time have to stress all weekend, waiting for Monday to see what the FDIC and Fed will do make them whole. I wonder though, if an offer was made to those same people waiting in line that they could cash out their deposits at 90 cents to the dollar, right then and there, how many people would have taken it? 

This is what USDC holders were doing while the banks were closed Friday night: cashing out or swapping into USDT and other assets. Despite losing 5% - 10%, I feel like most slept better knowing they are out of their USDC position rather than having to wait to see what unfolds on Monday. 

I understand I am not addressing other factors at play here, but those are not the point of this post. Many hold some of their savings in crypto to be their own bank, and this bank is open 24/7 365. Monday - Friday, 9 to 5 is a prehistorically inefficient system in comparison."

12/3/23,Scam email allegedly from a CEX came at a suspicious time,"So, recently I got a new phone and was unable to sign into my authenticator app for the new phone for Coinbase. I had to take a picture of the front and back of my driver's license and send it in to Coinbase and wait for them to manually verify it (I can't recall, but I might have had to take a picture of myself as well). Well, after a few days, I was verified and able to sign in and given 24 hours to sync my authenticator app on the new phone with Coinbase.

I did that (so, I thought), but then started receiving emails allegedly from Coinbase that said, ""You now have 24 hours access to update your 2-step verification method. Please update your information to prevent getting locked out again.""  It said a couple other things too, and had a link to click that said, ""Signin Verified"".  

I received a few of these emails, and we all know how scammers will sometimes misspell things on purpose or write sentences that don't follow good grammar rules---this one had a heading in the email that said, ""You're account not verified!"". It was just missing the word ""is"" before ""not"", said ""You're"" instead of ""Your"", and the place to click said ""Signin"" when it is usually spelled ""sign in"" or ""sign-in"".  (To be honest, I missed the ""Your"" and ""Signin"" the first time I read it.)

So, now some of you are thinking, ""Duh, it was obviously a scam. You always go to the app to check and NEVER click a link from an alleged email.""  Agreed; but here is the creepy part, how did the scammers know I had lost my authenticator access and had 24 hours from Coinbase to sync the authenticator with my new phone?  Was it just dumb random luck that they sent me this scam email at the same time I had switched phones??? 

To be safe I changed my email password and my Coinbase password. Be safe our there, friends."
12/3/23,Do you subscribe to the view that BTC is an insurance product in the event of fiat failing? -Greg Foss,"I think Greg Foss describes Bitcoin in a compelling way as an insurance to protect against fiat's failure. He works as a credit risk manager and has attempted to provide a valuation to Bitcoin in the context of fiat insurance. With his current risk score and assigned values, he estimates Bitcoin is currently worth $400,000 a coin as a hedge against fiat's global risk. 

The value comes from BTC being a safety net in the event of fiat values collapsing. When viewed this way, there aren't as many alternatives I can think of that would offer the same potential as BTC to hedge against a global fiat erosion. All existing hedges are still part of the traditional system.

This is a more neutral way of viewing BTC and less of a hyper maxi view that it's competing with money. It's simply a possible backup if one ever becomes necessary. As a society, safety nets and urgent alternatives seem warranted in such a volatile macro economy.



I can see this being a rationale value proposition. In terms of risk management, it offers something without counterparty risk. Unlike all other traditional fiat hedges."

12/3/23,"Fiat is the worse investment in all time, & bank runs are actually good for crypto","So, I highly doubt the bank run will spread to other banks beyond what it already did. But something I noticed is people's trust in the $ fiat dropped quickly when the bank run last week happened.

There is no hard evidence on this, but I wonder if it happened on a Monday and through the week it spread to even hit major banks like BOA. I wonder if people would keep their value in fiat or put it in something else like crypto, metals, stocks, etc.

&#x200B;

I'm thinking they will put it in things like crypto. One of the things that came up due to what happened but quickly was forgotten about was buying power. People for a short bit were talking about changes of buying power, and some in some groups were legit talking about treating fiat as an investment due to this. And fiat is a bad investment.

&#x200B;

I wonder if this is something we can push. Not the bank run, but how keeping money in fiat is a type of investment, and it's a bad one because the decreased buying power of it over time. Where it would be known as the worse investment type in all time.

&#x200B;

Thoughts?

&#x200B;

EDIT:

It seems most are assuming I'm talking about short term holding when it comes to fiat. Buying food, clothes, etc. I'm talking about long term.

See when you go from paycheck to buying something in a short time. The buying power doesn't really change from when you get it normally. Where as I argue savings shouldn't be in fiat. Even if you don't use crypto to hold your value. Holding it in fiat is a bad idea IMO because you lose buying power over time. Meaning you need whatever investment to pay 5% or more to keep up with the average buying power change. (more because taxes) Otherwise you're losing roughly 5% per year in just buying power just keeping it as fiat.

&#x200B;

Edit 2:

Sorry for not wording it right. When I say worse investment. I meant based on what you know vs not knowing. It's 100% known with the current system fiat will lose buying power year over year. Which means when you leave your money long term as fiat you 100% know you will lose roughly 5% buying power each year.

Where with investments it's an unknown. Yes if an investment does worse than yes it is the worse investment. But these things you won't know for 100% because they are in the future. So right here right now, with the knowledge you know. Doing nothing you will always lose roughly 5% per year. "

Can someone explain to me the function of banks & how cryptocurrency could have prevented something like the collapse of SVB? 

In my limited understanding, banks were useful when money was physical. If you’re Roku, you really don’t want $250 million in cash laying around. Cash can be destroyed or cash can be stolen. Until recently, banks were useful because there was no good way to transfer digital currency. 

Now, it seems like an unnecessary risk to give control of your capital to known bad actors. Until recently, I would have thought the primary benefit was security - FDIC insurance & the like. Turns out that’s useful for individuals, like me, but is completely inadequate for the overall financial system. 

Long question short - is this what the ‘be your own bank’ people are talking about? Has the risk inherent to holding your own money been eclipsed by the risk of handing your money over to a centralized bank? Frankly - I can’t think of a single good reason why a company like Roku would hand over their cash instead of simply holding it themselves. Is the reason I can’t think of a good reason simply because I don’t know enough?"

Imagine having stocks or land worth thousands of dollars but what you guys do when u need money in one hour and u have not enough fiat , u gonna sit and see your portfolio ? 

People says Cash is King , but often times in my life i realised Liquidity is King . There are very less assets in this world which u can sale on the spot , i do think Gold also comes to that category , especially countries like India . It is estimated that the amount of physical gold in the hands of Indian families (privately held not holdings by the Reserve Bank of India) amount to an astonishing 25000 – 27000 tonnes of Gold.

to wait 14 days and in some coins maybe 20 or 30 to have them free, here comes the torch wallet on zilliqa that with a small fee allows you to instant unstake and not only that but that fee returns to zilliqa to improve and develop the Blockchain
Even if you don't like the coin that freedom is worthy to make you sant stake, in drops or ups you have always the choose to have your coins available and with a sweet 13.25% apy for the period you are stacked

wondering what was that and then tried to develop sharding, 

This is the second time I'm posting about that feature but I believe is something that need attention, who's no need a nice apy? I know zil was down but no more than the other market, so if you want to stake at least do it with a coin and a wallet that gives you freedom on your own coins"

I remember last year Terra exposed how they planned to defend the peg and as soon as that happened it didn't take much time for a counterparty to expose it's flaws, 

Similar thing happened to Titan Token. 

It's amazing to me that BTC in 14 years is totally open source, exposed and is so robust that it keeps on ticking.  When there is so much money there's always is another side that tries to break it.

12/3/23,Crypto should humble you to your core,"Few things in life have have humbled me like crypto. The market volatility is one thing but the unexpected have just been surreal. I have to admit that I have been very fortunate  to make some decent earnings and have not fallen trap to any of the collapses we have seen from algorithm stable coins to centralized disaster and poncy exchanges or projects or been hacked of phished. Fingers crossed. Seeing these events unfold has humbled me to created an awareness within me I didn't know I had when I first got into crypto and mind you then I was paranoid about me signing anything or transferring hundreds or thousands from and exchange to a wallet or doing things in defi. Now I am more relaxed when it comes to those things but what I am extremely careful about is where I play and there in lies the key to me avoiding disaster. The word degen is often tossed around in a funny way but it is simply the most authentic word to describe most of us in this space. Monkey see opportunity for easy gains so monkey ape in hoping number go up only to be rekt. Classic!

I feel enormous pain and sadness for all who have lost in crypto. Crypto is hard and takes balls to jump into and stay. Staying is the hardest part and now that you have been in 1 cycle maybe 2 or 3 you are humbled to your knees knowing the dangers around you. Only you by doing your proper research can avoid such disasters. If you today have not yet been humbled by crypto I suggest you take a good look in the mirror. Being humbled doesn't mean you personally lost.  It also does not mean that you who have won needs to humble down. It just means that you are aware that planting your money in one bad protocol. Purchasing the wrong assets. Playing in the wrong chain or trusting the wrong CEX can lead you to absolute loss. Goes without saying you signing a wallet TX in a wrong protocl or site. 

Please be safe out there. Greed is all around us. From scammy North Korean hackers to the most selfish banker using your money to trade elsewhere. Only trust yourself and sriously. Keep it humble. It will serve you always as a reminder to ask yourself "" Should I be here? Should I do this? SHould I sign this? Should I buy this? etc.

Only then you will know that you are in a place that leads you to do proper research and carefully think your next steps."
12/3/23,Is it a good idea to invest in a stablecoin with APY's?,"I'm just not understanding why more people  aren't currently talking about or investing in stablecoin instead of placing all their savings in a bank account - at least a good chunk of it - without thinking to place it in a stablecoin, since to me, it seems like I would get HUGE annual returns every year (6% or so, right?) compared to like 0.01 interest in my bank savings - so it seems like one definitely should do this, right?   


However, I'm still a novice to the bulk of crypto, but I have a small portfolio of it currently, just to get it started.   


Also, if people are worried about losses in the future, can't one, theoretically, hold their stablecoin for a year, when it gains for that year, and convert it back to their bank while still benefitting regardless of the site fee? (Coinbase).  


Any help is really appreciated, guys."
12/3/23,What Makes Bitcoin the Most Important Cryptocurrency,
12/3/23,I think many have not realized that a “bank run“ is just as possible to happen on Crypto exchanges too and may already be happening.,"The past days and the upcoming days will probably all be chatter about the banking sector and how people will try to compare this to the 2008 financial crisis. We could already see a bank run happen for the second biggest banking collapse in US history at the Silicon Valley Bank last week but many in Crypto seem to think such things can‘t happen here, but that is not true.

While traditional finance may have banks, we have centralized exchanges that are essentially the same as banks and just as shaddy as we could see last year. CEX are just Crypto banks and it is obvious that in situations of FUD people will just ran as much to them to withdraw their Crypto. Last year we could perfectly see that with FTX.

&#x200B;

[$350M FTX withdrawals in the first two days of its FUD](https://preview.redd.it/n0isxys6ncna1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=33194845c9d29357a93d91421d9cfcee7c3170b4)

And just like with FTX, you can be pretty sure that nearly no exchanges will have ALL customer assets ready to withdraw, causing fear and a collapse of the exchange very quickly, one again FTX shows that perfectly. Other exchanges are no better and their so-called “Proof of Reserves“ are often incomplete and done by companies that dont do audits.

Yes I pay fees to someone who custodies my coins in cold storage but decided that being able to hold the 2 blue chips in a tax free account, to let it grow to what I think its going to grow to with a 10 year time horizon was more than worth it.

I am fairly technical, I work in a the tech sector and I am excited about where this technology is going, but all it seems to take is one wrong hasty click and I'm getting a divorce so...

My point is, this investment class is also exciting from a financial standpoint.  I'm in it for both the tech and the money.  If governments want to protect investors, they would allow a spot product for at least BTC so people can set it and forget it, and still enjoy the ride.  Some day when valuations for BTC and ETH are sky high again I will enjoy that money tax free.  Who knows I may be able to enjoy staking in a tax free account by then too.

The value of my airdrop is so low that I can‘t sell, because the trading platform has a minimum trading volume. The coin still has some positive value and therefore it counts toward the quarterly commission I have to pay to the trading platform, which leads to my question.

What do you do with coins like that in your portfolio, which you cannot get rid off? Should I pay the small increase of the commission and wait until the coin is worthless?

Edit: The commission I am talking about is a quarterly interest rate from the trading platform

While right now the price is being bearish maybe out metrics are being bullish .

One example of that may be the decreasing Leverage that we had since the FTX-crash in November of last year. Leverage is risky on itself and using that in Crypto is like going into the backrooms of the Casino to gamble even more. It is just not worth it and will cost you more money.

Here we can see that already in the past days there have been about $300M of Crypto liquidations alone, out of all this only the exchanges win. Also it is important to note that BOTH shorts and longs get equally punished by the markets.

But thankfully since the FTX crash the Futures Open Interest has been steadily going lower and lower, showing how many got liquidates but also how many took the lesson and are now better off. We should be happy with those “small“ gains and not be too greedy especially in a bear."

With uncertainty on the rise, banks getting fucked and with USDC. Especially the ties with SVB, Circle, Coinbase, and USDC, anyone unstake their ETH to move it to cold storage? 

I did a test wrap to cbETH and swap back to ETH test run with $10. Pretty straight forward, however I’m looking at about a “loss” of a few hundred dollars if I were to wrap all my staked ETH to cbETH (then swap back to ETH to send off exchange). 

How about everyone else? Did you go through with the move or are you simply waiting for the Shanghai update? You still feel safe and secure with your staked ETH on Coinbase?

What we will be using is Muun wallet. [https://muun.com/](https://muun.com/)

When you do you should be told how much this will cost you in network fee and what not.

But just take a moment to think about this with me. Apparently you are looking for a safe stable place to store your hard earned money, so you decided to come to the incredibly volatile space of crypto to store your wealth for a steady return.

Does that seem logical to you?

This space is known to be volatile as hell! Big risk , big gain! And you went for a 6-8% return on your money.

Exposing it to so much more risk than most other investments with steady returns.

Its like trying to ski in the sahara. Its possible (dubai) . But you have to ask yourself, why do it there…

its just the premise of looking for a stable thing in this gangsters paradise that seems so strange to me.

Silicon Valley Bank's collapse is a huge event and I think that we haven't realised nor faced consequences just yet. Many companies were affected and most of them are looking for ways to cover their liquidity issues asap without making much noise and government is not interested in this huge collapse because investors will be making runs on other banks to save their money unless... 

My guess is that fed may raise interest rates by not just 0.50% as many predict now, but 0.75% to prevent bank runs and to strengthen USD. 

At this point many may think — why the hell should it affect crypto in the first place? However, strong USD always means weak crypto and stocks because it becomes ""safer"" and more ""profitable"" for many people to hold their savings in banks, especially national one. 

We may see crypto recovery now while stocks asleep, but my crystal ball tells me that this situation may cause way more pain and blood on the streets than this.

12/3/23,Reminder: USDT employees manage roughly $2.6 billion EACH!,"USDT has a market capitalisation of [$74 billion](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/), while Tether has only 29[ employees on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tether/)\*

This means that each employee manages $74 billion/29, which is roughly $2.6 billion each.

I understand that the management of USDT doesn't require the same sort of oversight as, say, a real estate firm or bank, but this AUM per employee is still astronomical and slightly alarming.

I'm not trying to raise any sort of issues with USDT, and I will applaud it for being so stable in this time of turmoil. I just thought it was useful to raise this point now. 

**Tl;dr There's not many Tether employees for such a large amount of capital. Not necessarily FUD, but useful to know.**

\*It says that there are 47 employees, however a lot of these are ""investors in Tether"", or just entirely not related to the company. There are 29 who look like they actually work at Tether and I think that's generous.

The article is available in English [https://www.ukolova.ch/bitcoin-and-rgb/what-is-rgb-and-why-should-i-care](https://www.ukolova.ch/bitcoin-and-rgb/what-is-rgb-and-why-should-i-care)  
and was published in Bitcoin Magazine UA in Ukrainian [https://bitcoinmagazine.ua/technologies/1678169018-shcho-take-rgb-i-chomu-mene-tse-mae-hvilyuvati](https://bitcoinmagazine.ua/technologies/1678169018-shcho-take-rgb-i-chomu-mene-tse-mae-hvilyuvati)  


**TL;DR**  
RGB is a scalable & confidential smart contracts system which can be viewed as both layer2 and/ or layer 3 technology working on top of Bitcoin and, most importantly, at the moment of writing - the only solution working with the Lightning Network. RGB leverages the strongest points of Bitcoin and Lightning, while expanding their functionality to an astonishing level. RGB gives the ability to separate many different types of ownership rights (ownership of different assets defined under a contract) such as the right to own, use, transfer, modify, sell etc., from the contract states (conditions, under which a contract exists currently), proofs and contract evolution. Thus we can say that the RGB contract defines an event-consequence algorithm 'if this happens then that happens’ with an obligation to follow certain verification rules on each step."
12/3/23,We need to stop helping the other side with our language,"Bitcoin is NOT Crypto. Crypto can mean anything, and detractors will use the term generously when associating Bitcoin with POS shitcoins, and banking and securities failures. A look at media articles and headlines confirms this easily.

Bitcoin is traded, NOT bought and sold. Saying that you *bought* BTC infers that the fiat, and the banks and exchanges are a special part of the Bitcoin system. They're not! They use Bitcoin in the same way that everyone else does. $$ is *traded* for BTC, just like you might *trade* an old lawnmower for some sats.

Using these terms improperly holds back progress (and value) by spreading misunderstanding of what Bitcoin can accomplish."
12/3/23,Bitcoin is the only way you store wealth up your ass.,"I was thinking about the scene in Pulp Fiction where Christopher Walken tells a young Butch Coolidge how he kept his fathers watch up his ass for two years in a Vietcong prison camp. That led to a thought experiment of how I could store all of my wealth up my ass in case shit hit the fan, or just for fun. A thumb drive with my bitcoin on it os the only way.

This is yet another reason to own bitcoin."

11/3/23,Why I Believe Bitcoin is the Future,"I've been investing in Bitcoin since 2020, but tracked it long before then so I've seen the ups and downs of the market. Despite the volatility, I'm still holding onto my Bitcoin, and here's why:

Bitcoin is more than just a cryptocurrency - it's a game-changer. It's a decentralized, peer-to-peer electronic cash system that allows for direct transactions without the need for a middleman. This empowers people to take control of their money, reduces fees, and speeds up transactions.

But Bitcoin's potential goes way beyond payments. It's a revolutionary technology that's scarce, with only 21 million coins ever to be created. This makes it a store of value like gold. Bitcoin is also decentralized, meaning that it's not controlled by any single person or entity. This makes it resistant to censorship and control by governments or corporations.

With Bitcoin, anyone can contribute to its development and improve the code because it's open-source. And in the future, it has the potential to become a global currency that's accepted by businesses worldwide. While we're not there yet, I believe that Bitcoin has the potential to disrupt the traditional financial system and create a more equitable and transparent global economy.

Above all, I think there’s a new factor that’s recently gained traction within the space: artificial intelligence. ChatGPT and other AI models have serious potential to impact the crypto industry in several ways:

-Analysis and Predictive Capabilities: AI models like ChatGPT can be trained on vast amounts of data and can help to identify trends and patterns in the crypto market. This analysis can help traders and investors to make more informed decisions and can potentially improve their profitability.

-Trading Algorithms: AI models can be used to develop trading algorithms that can execute trades automatically based on market conditions and user-defined rules. These algorithms can be faster and more efficient than human traders, and can potentially lead to more profitable trades.

-Fraud Detection: Cryptocurrencies have faced issues with fraud and hacking. AI models can be used to detect fraud and prevent unauthorized access to cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges. This can help to improve the security of the crypto industry and enhance user trust.

-Customer Support: As the crypto industry grows, so does the need for customer support. Chatbots and virtual assistants powered by AI models can help to provide 24/7 customer support, answering questions and resolving issues in real-time.

-Blockchain Analytics: AI models can be used to analyze blockchain data, identify potential security threats, and track suspicious transactions. This can help to prevent fraud and improve the overall security of the blockchain.

Overall, the impact of AI on the crypto industry is still in its early stages, but there is significant potential for AI to enhance the security, efficiency, and profitability of the crypto market.

Sure, Bitcoin has risks. The price can fluctuate wildly, and there are security concerns. But I believe that the potential for Bitcoin to change the world is too great to ignore. I'm staying invested because I want to be a part of that change. Bitcoin is the future, and I'm excited to see what it holds."

12/3/23,"Freedom money is so important to life, just as important as oxygen water and the security of shelter.","We cannot live a good life if we dont know where our next meal will come from or not knowing if we will be homeless or not in a month from now. We need certainty surrounding these basic needs in order to think about doing anything else with our lives. Basic needs must first be met in order to progress.

Something that causes just as much uncertainty is a financial system that is not fit for purpose. Not knowing if your bank will fail, not knowing if your card will work while travelling overseas, not knowing how long a wire transfer will take to reach its destination, not knowing if a transfer will be declined because your bank doesnt like the look of it, not knowing if you have the right documents just to open a bank account.

All this uncertainty prevents humanity from progressing and flourishing. We need to be able to use our money freely without restriction just as much as we need to be able to breath without restriction.

Once the world has freedom money it will be like the whole world can finally breath properly. We need money that is guaranteed to never close or never fail like banks. Money that is always on and can be sent instantly with certainty anytime of any day to anywhere. Money that is global and accepted everywhere. I believe this will be bitcoin.

Bitcoin is freedom money and its going to take the world out of suffocating monetary hypoxia and deliver absolute monetary freedom with absolute certainty and that will allow humanity to progress and advance immensely.

The world desperately needs freedom money and bitcoin is that freedom money."

12/3/23,Can (or should) you talk about Bitcoin with someone who has minimal understanding of our current monetary system?,"Context: My mother is visiting from out of town. She knows I have converted some fiat into Bitcoin. She’s been vocal about thinking it will go to 0 and has repeated the “it’s backed by nothing” take. It’s never bothered me much. 

Yesterday, we were out for a walk and I asked if she heard about the SVB collapse. She hadn’t, and then asked how it happened. She’s not financially literate, so I tried to summarize saying the higher interest rates meant fewer borrowers, which put strain on the bank. Because they ran primarily on fractional reserves, once a run on the bank started, they couldn’t meet customer demand. 

My mother then said, “I don’t know what you mean by fractional reserves.” I was shocked, and gave her the spark notes version of it. At that point, I became convinced there is no way my mother (and probably so many other people) will ever actually understand the value of Bitcoin; not only do people not understand why fractional banking is dangerous to average citizens in general, they don’t even understand what fractional banking is. 

So, I’m pretty confident talking Bitcoin with my mother isn’t a good idea at all, but my question is- is it even possible to explain Bitcoin to someone who doesn’t understand the most basic banking concepts?"
12/3/23,Effect of BTC’s volatility on payments made via Strike?,"I came across a payment service called Strike recently, and I’m interested in its use for international transactions.

From what I’ve read, I can send 100 USD from the US to someone in Argentina such that the receiver gets Argentine Peso (ARS). “Under the hood” there is a conversion that happens between fiat & bitcoin which I understand. However, given the volatility of bitcoin’s price, doesn’t this introduce issues if the bitcoin price changes during the transaction?

Transaction diagram:

USD —> BTC —lightning—> BTC —> ARS

&#x200B;

Does Strike somehow “lock in” the price of BTC after the first conversion from USD to BTC? Otherwise isn’t it possible for the price of BTC to drop before the transaction is complete which means you get unfavorable forex rate from USD to ARS?

Example illustrating my concern:

**Exchange rate @ t=0**

*Forex rate*

USD: 100

ARS: 19,937.59

*Price of BTC*

BTC: 1

USD: 20,586.70

ARS: 4,104,491.84

**Exchange rate @ t=1**

*Forex rate*

USD: 100

ARS: 19,937.59

*Price of BTC is lower than @ t=0*

BTC: 1

USD: 20,000

ARS: 3,987,518

**USD —> BTC**

At t = 0, 100 USD gets converted to BTC which yields 0.00485751 BTC.

**BTC —> ARS**

At t = 1, 0.00485751 BTC gets converted to ARS which yields 19,369.41 ARS.

Based on the Forex rate, the receiver should’ve gotten 19,937.59 ARS but because the price of bitcoin dropped during the transaction only 19,369.41 ARS was received.

I’m sure this part of the transaction BTC —lightning—> BTC —> ARS happens very quickly but is it consistently and reliably fast enough such that the effect of bitcoin’s volatility is negligible during the transaction?

&#x200B;

**EDIT:**

**I found Jack Maller (Strike CEO) talking about risk from volatility here, and he mentions that they push the risk to ""liquidity providers & partners"". Can someone explain what he means exactly?**

This is fantastically accurate. After all the flak that Tether has received along the years (not undeservedly) it is now the one left standing as people expect US registered stablecoins to be either exposed US banking failures or be targeted by US regulators.

Who else believes that Tether will still fail at some point, and that only after Tether fails will we discover the true price of Bitcoin given how much of it has been purchased on the back of Tether?

12/3/23,"Bitcoin beginner question. Who sets the number of new bitcoins created per day to be this number of 900 (6,25 per every 10 minutes)?","To my newbie understanding bitcoin is a decentralized currency and there are no banks involved. That means that new money has to be printed and this is the way for bitcoin to create more of it's currency which bitcoin miners harvest and then the miners can eventually spend their bitcoin to buy things and the bitcoins will start circulating. So new bitcoins have to be created or otherwise it would be hard for bitcoin to function and expand as there wouldn't be enough or any bitcoins to use, especially when new bitcoin users would need bitcoins as well. This leaves me with the following questions which you more experienced bitcoin people probably have easy answers to.

Where does this number 900 new bitcoins created per day come from? Why isn't it 3200 new bitcoins created per day or 14 new bitcoins created every 10 minutes instead of 6,25 bitcoins created every 10 minutes?

Who is the person or who are the people who decide these numbers? Who are we trusting here? What if these people/person decide to change the numbers suddenly for what ever reason? If it was decided that the number of bitcoins given every 10 minutes would be as  high as 100 bitcoins, wouldn't that completely inflate the value of bitcoin, making people who are carrying any bitcoin basically loose a lot of value?

Lastly I want to ask, when is the last time that the number of bitcoins created per day & 10 minutes has been something other than the values 900 & 6,25?"

I tried to take advantage of the USDC depegging yesterday and managed to screw up the trade and so wanted some advice.  


Rationale for trade:  
When USDC was trading at $0.91 it was implying that all USDC assets locked in SVB were gone forever whilst HF were saying they were willing to buy these positions for $0.8 on the dollar so USDC should have been trading much closer to $1. So I thought I'd like to go long USDC.

Execution:  
I went on AAVE and collateralized some ETH to let me borrow in USDC, effectively making me go long USDC. The trade has worked and USDC is up 5% in 1 day but because I have to pay the quantity of USDC and not the notional value of the original loan so the trade has just cost me gas fees!

Edit2: Traders shorting crypto with USDC collateral should have been margin called during the 20% drop in USDC price. But it doesnt seem to have occurred. This is what happened with 3AC , they weren't margin called when their GBTC collateral fell in value, and led to the bankruptcies of FTX, Genesis and others. It would seem many other exchanges would be bankrupt if these stablecoins collapse, get your money off these exchanges ASAP!!!!! History repeats itself."

SVB failed because of their greed. They made bets on leverage, and they lost. Now their clients are fucked because of their greed.

Exactly the same thing happened to me. Despite not having SMS 2FA on my account Coinbase didn't ask the scammer for Goog Authentication and sent then an sms. When I finally recovered my account after Coinbase suspended it ""for security reasons "" they  DID require Google authentication from me.

They are as scummy as it gets"

12/3/23,The Benefits of Using Crypto Cards: How to Get the Most Out of Your Card,"After a wild and eventful ride over the last few years, crypto has made its mark, and it’s here to stay. Everyone has heard of crypto, and around 10% of adult internet users own some. But how are they using it? Sure, you can hold crypto or cash it out. But that’s missing the bigger picture.

You’re The Boss: Crypto Works For You.

With crypto cards, you can still hold crypto and cash out gains. But the cards let people use crypto just like real money. Crypto cards even pay out cashback for spending it. Who doesn’t want their money to make them more money?

The Butterfly Effect.

Using crypto as real money will have major impacts on the economy. People see crypto is easy to use and spend, with lower fees and no downtime, and then more people enter the world of crypto, bringing down fees and improving services. More people get paid in crypto because they can just use their cards… and on it goes.

Who knows where it will all lead? Minor victories have major consequences, and we’re only at the beginning. Are you with us?"

Around 251 trillion SHIB, excluding the dead address for burning, are currently held by the biggest holders of the meme coin. However, data from IntoTheBlock shows that there are currently 40 addresses holding nearly 122 trillion SHIB, in this group. Several of the biggest backers of SHIB have abandoned the token in favor of alternative cryptocurrencies, and SHIB whale holdings have decreased dramatically since November last year. At the time of writing, SHIB was trading at $0.00001008, losing nearly 10% of its value. The future value of Shiba Inu remains uncertain, and its market direction may be determined by whether or not the price level is held or whether it breaks down.
